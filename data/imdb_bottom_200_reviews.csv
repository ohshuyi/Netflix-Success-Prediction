tt2344678,"I usually do not write reviews as I do not have time to do so. But for this movie, I am still in shock and could not resist to register and write a review. Sajid Khan, as always is the worst director and a movie maker in the bollywood industry ( may be in the entire world). While watching the movie, I could not believe what I was watching. The movie was so pathetic that I was ashamed on myself for watching it. My confidence level has really gone down after watching this movie. Sajid Khan needs psychiatric treatment with shock therapy. I wish there is a class action law suit against him for making such movies, for mental torture and making people feel idiots. I urge everyone to watch this movie so everyone in the world must know how pathetic, poor, terrible, shameless director this guy is. but please do not spend money for this movie."
tt2344678,"You need to be brave, courageous and strong to watch this Movie. This more like a Torture than an Entertainer. Sajid Khan Claimed that this is the best movie he made. HE must visit a Doctor. Ajay Devgn shouldn't sign movies which are remakes. It's sad and disappointing to see a fantastic actor losing his track by doing these crap Masala movies. Well Now for the Movie Direction : It's weak and not worth commenting. This worst Sajid Khan's Movie ever. Dialogues are average. Looks like a 10 year old wrote it.Performances : Ajay Devgn tries hard but the script is awful. Ajay Is just okay. He looks convincing though. He has a one or two good scenes but that 's not enough. Tamannaah Bhatia is wasted . She is beautiful and has a screen presence but she is more like a Talking Doll. Mahesh Manjrekar is good. Paresh Rawal is the SAVING GRACE of the movie. His performance will make you laugh. Rest of the cast is purely average.Music : The original was famous for it's music and it's dance set pieces. The music isn't great expect the 2 songs ""Taki Taki"" and "" Naino Mein Sapna"". But the choreography is AWFUL.There are 2 item songs. Not Great.Action : It's over the ROOF TOP. Senseless to be frank. Overall : It's a Waste of time. Better watch ""JOLLY L.L.B"" or 'Mere Dad Ki Maruti' Wait for It : It has A TIGER!!!! AJAY DEVGN FIGHTS WITH A TIGER AND WINS!!! YES A TIGER!!! OHH GOD WHY???0.5/5This is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!This movie can can be Compared his Sister's with Tees Maar Khan and His Brother-in-Law's Joker."
tt2344678,"Climax scene, very intense. Son (Ajay Devgan) is getting beaten inside a temple compound by villains in front of his mother, sister and girlfriend. Mother, finally enters into temple and pleads to god ""Bas Maa Bas, Aur Kab Tak"".Entire cinema hall bursts into laughter! I doubt there can be any bigger insult to a movie maker than this - he is trying to create an emotional scene and viewer is getting comedy out of it. If I could, I'd request govt to consider giving out some sort of award - not to the movie, but to the viewers for going through this tormenting, nerve-racking, torturous assault on human logic. I wish I could get my money back and sue the director for wasting my 2 hours.Well, this was probably the most confused movie I have ever seen. The treatment is pathetic and the entire movie is shot casually without any brains. It being a remake of an old movie (well, almost all the decently launched Hindi movies now a days are either remake of some Tamil / Telugu / Kannada / Hollywood film or some sequels like Murder 3, Jism 3, Race 2, Saheb Biwi and Crap returns, Ashiqui 2, Yamala Pagla Deewana 2 etc) always brings additional expectation of it to be slightly better than the earlier one. Not with this one. Forget being better, if Jitendra sees it, he might contemplate killing himself for approving such a shady remake.Movie starts with a street fight which is idiotically shot. Then suddenly jumps to a railway station called Ramnagar. Ajay Devgan gets down from the train with dress and shades of 2013 for a movie which supposedly is of 1980s. Meets mother - mothers tells some senseless story - they move in to their home and starts taking revenge on villain. I guess my narration of story is far better than how Sajid Khan has managed to display it.Presence of Paresh Rawal doesn't help with comic quotient of the movie. Its ridiculously meaningless - but I guess we must have gotten used to it by now with Houseful and Houseful 2. I am yet to figure out why Sajid Khan is loosing his brain with each movie he is releasing. Hey Baby was a much better entertainer and after that, he seemingly has lost his sane in making movies.The tiger fight scene is absurd and nonsensical. In 2013, where CGI is so far advanced, the entire stretch is shot as if the director is running on budget crunch. Guess, it is more of a intellect-crunch at directors end than anything else.Well, not everything is bad in this movie. There are two good things - call them eye soothing if you wish - Tamannah, who simply looked fabulous, and 5 beauties dancing on ""Dhoka Dhoka Dhoka"" item song. The song is ludicrous (like rest of the songs and the movie itself), but I guess having 5 item girls helped a bit to glorify the screen.Should you watch this movie? Well, go ahead if you want to see how an illogical movie is made to abuse human brain. I lost my senses after watching this movie and had to wait 24 hours before I could gain some of it to write this apt review.In my opinion, you'll be much better off sipping some drink and enjoying a biryani with that money in some decent restaurant than wasting it here. If you are not hungry, give that money to some beggar for god's sake, better than wasting on it. You would not miss anything in life if you haven't watch it - trust me!"
tt2344678,"I clearly remember when I first saw the trailer of Himmatwala and at the end of it written A Sajid Khan Entertainer, I was sure that another trash from sajid's kitty is going to see the daylight and this time I promised not to watch the movie in theater at least. Then finally i watched it in my Laptop and i was so happy that Sajid khan didn't prove me wrong.Each and every scene and the nuances of each character's depiction was so silly, unfunny and annoying that i completed the movie within 1 hr and 10 mins.The shocking thing was how could an actor like Ajay Devgn's caliber sign a nonsense movie like this? just for the sake of 100 Cr moolah that could make a hat trick other two being Bol Bachchan and SOS. Tamannah, please go back to south and if Trisha fails to grab a position in Bollywood, then of course you can't. Again as there are so many other bimbos flying high with success with khans without knowing acting then chances to sizzle on bollywood screen gets higher courtesy Sajid Khan.Sorry Jacqueline Fernandez. And yes Sajid, as you hate critics, so let me tell you am no critic and love Hindi films but know the difference between good and bad.And yes in a recent reality show where you were one of the judges,you were saying repeatedly "" Your performance is like Sajid Khan's Blockbusters"" gone horribly wrong at least from the multiplex collections of Himmatwala. And Multiplex audiences are more of a class. Rest You can think yourself..Please No Himmatwala 2....EARNEST REQUEST!!!"
tt2344678,"I just wasted 2 hours of my life for this crap. After seeing Joker and Tees Mar Khan i was expecting that those were the worst things ever happened to me but boy , Sajid Khan proved me wrong. This crap is senseless and a torture to anyone . U must be a real himmatwala to watch himmatwala (bullshit). Sajid Khan please use some logic before releasing a torture cell. Do not waste your time and money . Acting by each and everyone in the movie is pathetic. Ajay Devgan disappointed me a lot . Im a huge fan of him but he is a total waste in this movie. Direction from Sajid Khan is too bad. I think he was confused while making this movie and did not know what to do . Tamanna Bhatia is beautiful but her acting was not up to the mark. Paresh Rawal is way out of his own league in this flick. In a nut shell this movie is going to be the biggest flop of this year."
tt2344678,Help me guys. Rate this shi*t 1/10 and throw pup on Sajid Khan's face.Also thumb up the review so everyone can see only one line and save their time._______________________________Cant believe why Ajay and Pervesh would do such a film. This movie make Tees Maar KHan and Joker award winning movies. Hope Akshay don't do his films in future. He thinks all of us are jokers wating to get fooled.Only Good thing is songs (those reused)are reasonablly well. Tamanaah look very good but cant be said about her acting.Cant believe why Ajay and Pervesh would do such a film. This movie make Tees Maar KHan and Joker award winning movies. Hope Akshay don't do his films in future. He thinks all of us are jokers wating to get fooled.
tt2344678,"Himmatwala directed by Sajid Khan is one of the worst remakes I have ever seen.The 1983's Jeetendra-Sridevi's Himmatwala was entertaining while 2013's Ajay Devgn-Tammanah's Himmatwala is horror offered to the audience in the name of entertainment.While the movie has a running time of 150 minutes,I could not endure this nonsense for more than an hour and I had to leave the theater!The action sequences,too,are boring,because they are the same repetitive action scenes which we have seen in many movies before.The direction by Sajid Khan is done to death.The screenplay is badly written.The music is sonorous.The dialogs written by Sajid-Farhad are awful.Performances: Ajay Devgn is strictly okay.Tamannah overacts.Mahesh Manjrekar is fine.Asrani hams and is wasted in a small role.Special mention of Paresh Rawal,who steals the show with his fabulous performance!All in all,Himmatwala directed by Sajid Khan is an Idiotic piece of work presented to the audience in the name of Entertainment!I am giving it a generous one on ten(Solely for Paresh Rawal). A Disappointment!"
tt2344678,"the first existential question that arises after watching this movie is whether this trite is worth reviewing....the answer was an overwhelming NO,then i thought of the snotty and obnoxious manner in which the sibling director duo has been panning all and sundry in their movies and in award ceremonies.The so called TALENTED DUO has been directing some pathetic movies such as housefull,joker etc.Himmatwala, the latest in the khan assembly line production is another DUD in the offing.It seems no one is advising the all knowing brother sister duo to clean their stinking Aegean stables once and for all.Himmatwala amply displays that Sajid khan is no director.....he's merely a mimic harbouring gargantuan ambitions.SORRY.....but thats what the dirty rotten truth is !!!!!!"
tt2344678,"This is overconfidence of Sajid that he knows how to make 100 cr from movies.These days everyone is making their life time worst movies. Ram gopal verma ki AAG, Farah Khan - Joker, Sajid - Himatwala.Don't watch this movie, I stopped it after 30 mins and I haven't laughed once :).So all the best if you dare to watch ;)IMDb should have 0 star or 1/2 star option.Now i can really understand the 1 star movie.Don't know why critic gave it 2 starswaiting for good one.."
tt2344678,I have seen the Jeetu starring Himmatwala. And i have to admit the kind of humor and typical humor of 80's. It has been captured well and reincorporated in this project by Sajid Khan. In my opinion because the audience has grown from 80s and has become more mature. It might seem too lengthy or boring or senseless. But that is how movies of 80;s were at that time. If you have patience and if you were charmed by 80s era. You will absolutely love the movie and think of it as a visual delight. Humour fun and lot of drama with fantastic comedy scenes. Music has been themed after 80's era as well. Very peppy and upbeat music although fewer songs would have done more justice as audience is losing patience these days. I hope it appeals to audience who were born before 1990's. I am sure Iphone might not relate to it much.
tt2344678,"The worst the worst film ever, i won;t spend even a single rupees for this pit film. Sajid Khan feels he is the best director of the film industry but he should knows this that he is the worst in all. He doesn't have any writing sense or directing sense. I wonder why great actor like Ajay Devgan is doing such films like this and wasting his talent. It is pitiful that a national award winning actor that does film like Bhagat Singh can do Himmatwala. Already i disliked the original film but how could the makers even think of remaking it on such a heavy budget. I think as this has gone flop the director will now take few years to come back just as his sister's brother. It's funny film for the makers not the film."
tt2344678,"Remembering the day, when I first heard Sajid Khan announcing an official remake of Jeetendra, Sridevi starrer HIMMATWALA released in 1983, I was really shocked since it was not a great film in terms of content despite of being a big hit in those tough years. Now the phrase 'those tough years' has been used here, since the decade of 80s is apparently considered to be the most forgettable, amateurish and indecisive decade of Bollywood in the history of its 100 years of film- making as far as the commercial films are concerned. So making a remake of a film selected from that era was quite strange and weird to accept all of a sudden. Yet considering the successful track record of Sajid Khan, I thought that probably he might have cracked some worth trying comic idea within the same storyline and maybe would come up with something interesting rediscovering the 80s in his own version.But surprisingly it was really unacceptable to find that Sajid does nothing of that sort in his over-hyped film to please the new age viewers and just sticks to the same old melodramatic script full of all clichéd plots not appealing to the present net generation at all. Now here an important question arises, that if one really is willing to see a film chosen from that forgotten era of the 80s, then he can easily opt for the original only, which at least would provide him the feeling of that 'Pleasant Nostalgia' watching the jumping jack, Jeetendra and the owner of thundering thighs, Sridevi along with the incomparable witty Kader Khan performing at their best. And if he can easily get to see the film on the net just for free or on a DVD for only a few rupees then why on earth he would like to see the same outdated acts being performed by the present big stars at a cost of a high priced ticket?In other words, if Sajid simply assumed that the viewers in 2013 will really be amused to see Ajay Devgan deliberately doing all those over the top fights and emotional sequences without any contemporary touches or favourable changes introduced, then he was gravely mistaken in doing so, because the films utterly fails to make any kind of entertaining or emotional connect of that sort with the viewers in its pretty long length of 150 minutes. And the same can also be said for its entire cast too wherein Ajay Devgan looks like a clown performing in that peculiar style of the 80s hero, Tamannajust manages to look beautiful awfully speaking ""I hate Gareebs"" in a childish tone and one truly feels pity seeing an extremely gifted actor Paresh Rawal performing such a silly act wearing a horrible wig. To add further Sajid's own self praised film falls completely flat in its soundtrack department too with the remixed tracks missing the required bubbly spirit and the fresh songs simply falling into the category of below average. However the cinematography does try to give you something to watch and so does the background music desperately trying to pump up the blood at regular intervals.Further replying to the bragging statements given by the director weeks before the release of his film I would like to say that for me neither Ajay's entry had anything exceptional to cheer for nor I could appreciate the stupid spoof played on Alfred Hitchcock's cult classic PSYCHO. So, if Sajid is firm on his statement of paying back the ticket amount to those who didn't feel like clapping on Ajay's entry in the film, then probably he would have to spend a lot paying many like-minded friends disagreeing to his assurances given like myself. In addition I also have another question for the director that if he was really making a film for that common man of the interiors who comes into the theater just for his escapist entertainment, then why were the few subtitles shown in the film written in English and not Hindi?Anyway, coming to the only silver lining in this black cloud, I would like to mention its two action sequences with the TIGER which easily transported me back to those years when we eagerly used to wait for a tiger fight in a film particularly the ones featuring the Garam Dharam. May be the kids would enjoy this more than the mature audiences which might become the only saving grace of the film to sustain in the home video market. Nevertheless, the truth remains that while watching the tiger in this bad remake, I just had the famous slogan in mind in a different form which said, ""Save This Tiger"" instead of ""Save The Tiger"" ironically.Summing up, one really needs guts to see this HIMMATWALA made with some questionable expectations by the makers, religiously following its outdated original of the past lacking the much needed appeal for the current generation."
tt2344678,Usually I don't mind no brainer entertainers at least they bring some smile on your face. I am not going to comment on story because lack of it was expected as I knew I was going to watch Sajid Khan's movie. But this movie didn't even do justice even with its genre. There was only one good joke and that was on save the tiger which was already running TV adverts day in and day out. If Sajid Khan didn't come with a good movie anytime soon then this might be his career's last. I reckon that everyone from film crew who must have seen pre-screen should have stopped the movie. If projects turn out to be so bad then it should be benched.
tt2344678,"When you remake a classic 80's movie , you carry a big responsibility of living up to the audience's expectation. Himmatwala carries of the genre of 80's era but falls flat on the face with horrible direction and over- top-performance.Ravi( Ajay Devgan) returns to his village after 20 years to avenge his father's murder from a cruel and heart-stoned Sher Singh ( Mahesh Manjrekar).Director of somewhat-OK Heyy Baby and pathetic Housefull series, Sajid Khan made of a fun of himself and the movie which will give you nothing but severe headache once you will leave the theater. The running time of 2.30 hrs does seems elongated with a pale script which has more loopholes than the government services. Have not we witnessed such kind of story in India cinema before ? When you have so many talents and creativity this year for trying out something new , you have a film like Himmatwala which is a reflection of bad light in Bollywood. Worst scenes include the spoof on Psycho ( yes you heard it right) - the classic scene where a woman in shower is murdered by a stranger, the fight scene between tiger and Ajay Devgan , the chemistry between Tamanna and Devgan - the list is endless. I feel bad for actors like Ajay Devgan and Paresh Rawal wasting their talents in film like this. Music is irritating . Cinematography is good. Art direction nice depicting the era of 80's very well. Performance by other stars are insignificant. Overall , a bad film at every aspect. Sajid Khan completes the series of disaster right after TEES MAAR KHAN , JOKER and now HIMMATWALA."
tt2344678,"No. This was the original one-word review I submitted, because really that's all I have to say about the sole Bollywood release this week,There are those who will be satiated by the story of the poor man's struggle against corrupt overlords and will revel in the triumphant conclusion, while Sajid Khan will undoubtedly defend his film to the hilt, issuing the caveat that it is but an 'entertainer'.Thankfully, Hindi cinema has moved on in leaps and bounds from this. It's a period we would rather forget. Instead of being nostalgic about the regressive cinema of yore, it's surely time to leave the archaic values and misogyny of the past behind us and look towards a brighter future both for modern Hindi cinema and Indian society.The title is fitting. You have to be a 'himmatwala' to endure this."
tt2344678,"The Film is a remake of the 1983 blockbuster 'Himmatwala' *ing Jeetendra & Sreedevi.Ajay Devgan as Ravi did a great job, except in dance sequences. The punch lines, fights, ferocity in the eyes etc hit the bulls eye. Tamanna looked beautiful but needs to work on her acting skills..Paresh Rawal,was great nd was really entertaining..Zarina Wahab was good, so is Leena Jumani, Ajay's sister! Junior Suman as usual wasted, mahesh manjerakar was a biggest disappointment, he was total misfit , he lacked that cruelness nd even comic sense which was expected.."
tt2344678,"A mustwatch to understand how not to make a film. Amazingly horrible, wastes the actors talents completely"
tt5290620,"I don't know where to start, but this movie turned out as awful as I expected. Firstly, another profession may suit Tushar Kapoor well, but acting is not his cup of tea (expect when he didn't talk at all in Golmaal). Second, poor acting, poor screenplay and no jokes or real comedy. It was all old jokes and so predictable. I was excited to see Mandana Karimi act because of Bigg Boss Season 9 and oh my god, it was disappointing. They dubbed her voice, a voice the viewers watching her are not used to and it just sounds awful. I would've been much happier to hear Mandana Karimi talk in her broken Hindi than that dubbed voice.Finally, if you're here to read the review of this movie to decide whether you're going to watch it or no, just don't. You're going to waste your money, time and may lose some IQ points. Terrible."
tt5290620,"As far as Bollywood films are concerned, 2016 started quite well with Wazir, but this one here is an obvious mishap.There's not much to say about this sex comedy other than it being a mixture of sleazy humor, ridiculous slapstick, embarrassing performances, and ugly design. Sex comedies are fine as far as they make you laugh, but in here utter silliness is all there is.It is disheartening to see good actors like Aftab Shivdasani resorting to mindless boilers like this which may entice crooked people, but is only a disgusting roll of celluloid that is murkier than a toilet seat.BOTTOM LINE: Umesh Ghadge's Kyaa Kool Hain Hum 3 is a must miss. Period.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOVulgarity: Infinity"
tt5290620,"You seem to get some of these movies all around world cinema. In Bollywood too, it is these kind of movies which tend to bring down the good work done by other movies. Kya Kool Hain Hum 3 is the 3rd movie in a adult comedy franchise which is now just being produced and made to extend the career of probably the worst actor in todays generation in the Hindi film industry. It is full of what is expected from this film, all sexual innuendos and double meaning dialogues. It provides the cheap humor it sets out to deliver. But it is nothing special or new that we haven't seen a hundred times before. Both the lead actors are obviously looking for a paycheck and deliver another terrible performance. The newcomer actress ""Mandana Karimi"" struggles to deliver expressions in the few scenes where she is required to act. There is no real story or plot or even attempt or effort visible in this movie by the makers. All in all, a movie that is to be avoided to preserve ones brain cells. This is as worse as one could expect from a Tushar Kapoor movie."
tt5290620,"The third installment in Kyaa Kool Hain Hum film series, 'Kyaa Kool Hain Hum 3' fails to entertain. The adult jokes don't leave you in splits & none of the gags leave an impact. 'Kyaa Kool Hain Hum 3' Synopsis: A porn actor uses his fellow adult movie stars in creating a fake traditional family, in order to impress his girlfriend's conservative father.The only silver-lining of this wasted opportunity, is Aftab Shivdasani. He appears to be having fun & delivers a perfectly over-the-top, crazy performance. The same can't be said about Tushar Kapoor & Krishna Abhishek, as they both don't infuse laughter in the goings-on. Even Kyaa Kool Veteran Riteish Deshmukh in a cameo, doesn't work!I genuinely enjoyed the 2 previous installments prior to this one, because they made me laugh, at least in parts. But this one, just doesn't! So Not Kool."
tt5290620,"What was that, Really. I wasted my 2 hours for this boring and disrespecting disgusting film. The people like Tushar Kapoor are not doing well that's why they are trying hard to get a good image, but like this, damn. No kid should watch this movie because of bad language. And for people like us wanting movies like Bahubali, PK, Airlift, Bajirao Mastani and more.Please its my request to the directors of whole Bollywood cinema, Please stop making movies like this one.And my review about this movie is that you can make a comedy movie like Hungama, Hulchul, Hera Pheri, Dhol, Dulhe Raja, Bol Bachchan, Teen Thai Bhai and more. Then why movies like this."
tt5290620,"kya fool hain hum ? this is what every viewer should be asking from the makers of this disgraceful, highly regressive, z class film which sadly became a hit in India. It is so pathetic that it makes you wonder if this is the kind of stuff required to make people laugh in the future ? Bad films should not be reviewed or analyzed but this one is a classic case where from acting to script to direction to almost every Dept. sunk to the limits. the only thing that this film has is jokes centering around that one body part of male and female, and the respect it showed towards it is amazing. It is not just lack of brains but also a lack of sensibility and morality by everybody involved in the making of such mindless effort. The film evokes sheer disgust."
tt5290620,"1) Editing:- This is what made the film appear uninteresting to me. The third installment in the ""Kya kool hain hum"" franchise was supposed to be a comedy film and Comedy is a genre all about timing, which unfortunately for this film was ruined by abrupt censorship. Those abrupt cuts make the action and reaction look poor and thus take away the main elements of humor from this film. The dining table scene for example where you see Darshan Jariwala's change of expressions and later you see a dog. The two shots don't connect. You know a lot crucial has been censored out and instead of bursting out into laughter, you are trying to figure out what exactly could have happened! 2) Plot and twists of the story were Average. Though there were frequent jokes and situations that would make you giggle, one can watch the film for such decorative frills in the film.3)Most enjoyable performance:- Krushna's confident performance as always was a delight to watch! 4) Loop holes:-There were two things that had no significance either story or climax wise yet it was repeated several times. a) Tushar Kapoor goes cross-eyed upon seeing the red color. b)Jariwala's character's inability to sit! I give this a rating of 2 because it didn't impress me a lot with the comic factor, The reason behind which I have mentioned in the point 1. I end this review with a question that one must think about:- q) Why should a film which is anyways receiving an 'adult' certificate be chopped off its shots that bridge a scene?"
tt5290620,"When you don't have anything except some over the note, A rated jokes which can make your typical gang laugh then this type of movie get conceived. I was not expecting story but yes was expecting to understand the happening alias I couldn't. Screenplay has two main things, first, how to spoof on Bollywood big movies by stuffing A rated and double meaning words and actions. Second lift up some plot of hit movies and mix it up with cackling thinking. I can't laugh on all spoofs except the spoof on Kick, that was crisp but rest are lengthy. I am done with the typical Adult names of characters. There is very fine line between seduction and repulsion. According to me, they have taken repulsion as seduction. First half is very slow and only focus was, how to take actors Thailand and shoot spoofs. Second half rounds around Golmaal and Bol Bachchan plots then some other movie plot. When they get tired about doing all this they introduced one male lead as female. It was irritating. It was meant to make you laugh but I got heavy. That sand swamp scene in climax is unbearable. Nothing in the name of performance and music."
tt5290620,"this movie is a shame on the name of comedy.. Due to these types of films, movies standard going down nd down every day. even RGV's AAG is better than this. NO story, no better dialogs, poor editing and worst acting by both the actors.. because previous two movies were little bit better so director thought to make most out of this fame and they are making anything. Literally i wasted my 2 hours. i was like what the hell is going on ?? the only time i was laughing was how come they can make such a disastrous movie... Even within this series, the first Kyaa Kool Hain Hum (2005) was fun because there was a freshness to it. The follow-up film, Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum, was boring, offensive and icky. Kyaa Kool Hain Hum 3 is not even trying. Maybe it's our fault that, as an audience, we made its predecessors hits. As with politicians and the media, so it is with cinema - I guess we get the films we deserve. What next? Kya Super Stupid Hain Hum?"
tt5290620,"Well,many people are criticising this film because their age is 65+ and they can't digest movies like this. Bollywood always lacked Sex-Comedy genre and its a good sign that Bollywood film makers are now making movies like this.It depend on your choice that you like family movies or movies like this,so criticising this movie due to its genre is an awful,non- sense act. ""Kya Kool Hain Hum 3"" is a brilliant movie and its entertaining enough to keep you engaged. Despite of many problems,this movie manages to make you laugh.There are good comedy scenes,interesting plot and everything that you can expect from a sex-comedy. This movie is much better than other Bollywood comedies like ""Kis Kisko Pyar Krun"", ""Welcome Back"" etc... You guys need to learn that sex- comedies are not meant to be logically exceptional,they're made to amuse you.And we can see that thing in Hollywood sex-comedies like American pie etc.. Its my sincere request to everyone that don't bash this movie because its a sex-comedy and it will ruin our culture. Its a newly introduced genre in Bollywood and we should welcome it !"
tt5290620,"I thoroughly enjoyed this flick and was still impressively entertained by Tusshar. Tusshar is arguably the most funniest male actor in bollywood. Despite negative IMDb reviews on 'kyaa kool hain hum 3', i wasn't expecting too much.. I really like watching Tusshar movies. Despite movie's lower ratings, I and my wife watched it just 'coz we wanted to see tusshar madness. Its a easy going story and most of all its badly explored & the storyline is not very interesting but worth watching. A fairly predictable ending but didn't bother my interest in wanting to keep finding out what happens. Give it a chance, you just might be glad you did. OK.....go for it and enjoy."
tt5290620,"Don't know what I was thinking before watching KKHH-3,may be i had some expectations for it to be as entertaining as ""Grand Masti""was not expecting a nail-biting script or Oscar worthy acting but had hope for a decent flick but it was all drowned to the abyss in the first 20 minutes and after that it became dull,boring and painful to watch,I was trying so hard to laugh but I couldn't, It even wasted a talented actor like ""Krushna Abhishek"",Ekta Kapoor has tortured us with her SAAS-BAHU Crying games for 15 years and now she is doing it with movies,if she wants her brother ""Tushar Kapoor"" to stay in limelight then make some good if not great movies because cinema like this will only defame his reputation"
tt5290620,"Ekta Kapoor has profited on exploiting negative aspects of social Indian norm with all her serials. This movie is a pure testament of her ability to profit from the growing trend for the Indian crowd. Like Salman Khan she found a niche market for sexually frustrated crowd to capitalize and bank. This movie is complete and utter nonsense which focuses on grabbing audience with hormonal fluctuation and frustration. I only watched the trailer and 20 minutes of the movie and walked out noticing the complete lack of cinematic obligation to provide a relatable plot and obscene dialogue. To anyone dedicated to watching quality cinema don't watch this, because it feeds the snake that bites your hand off. I hope for the future of Indian cinema to be more like the directives of SS. Rajamouli and Aamir Khan who focus on realism and encourage people to look at the originality and enticing cinematic provess of Indian History and story telling."
tt5290620,This review may not sound good... But this film doesn't deserve this too....... Plot is zero... Acting is zero... Songs are zero... Film is a big zero.. I think the writer doesn't had enough time to write a meaningful script so he mixed Golmal and Bol Bachchan and prepared a piece of crap... From the beginning to the end there was nothing entertaining... Had a high expectations but proved nothing.. I think this movie could only last for few weeks and may in future remembered as one of the worst adult comedy film......I am not being too harsh but better think before watching this... I am disappointed for wasting my precious time....
tt5290620,"Post the unexpectedly huge success of GRAND MASTI, it seems the makers are ready and willing to cross more bolder limits to earn some quick weekend returns, finding the courage to promote the latest part of KYAA KOOL HAIN HUM series as India's first ever 'Porn-Com' or Porn Comedy in its promotional campaign.However their 'visionary' plans are sure not going to work big time, since the film neither has anything enjoyable in terms of sex or comedy with everything simply falling flat without any likable mass appeal. Interestingly it all begins well with a bang, projecting that there's lot more coming next in the subsequent hours providing the expected content. But strangely the film never takes any major leap in the later reels and remains entirely dependent upon all badly written double meaning dialogues, suggestive moanings, cheap dragging-in of reputed names such as Karjatya (mocking The Badjatyas) and unengaging sequences presenting the same old plot of presenting a group of friends as members of one 'Sanskari family' in front of a visiting relative.As a matter of fact, the word 'porn' is used in the tagline, since one of its lead actor Krishna is into making porn films in Bangkok as spoofs of the hit Hindi films like LICK instead of KICK, KHOLEY instead of SHOLAY and more bringing in the only few entertaining moments in the entire film. Apart from that KKHH3 doesn't have anything in either the screenplay, gags, dialogues or individual (erotic) performances wherein the director and his writer even use a rat, dog, horse and a macaw too (a long-tailed colourful parrot) in desperation to bring in the desired humour, which actually turns the film into a silly mess post intermission.In the performances, continuing his mastery achieved in such silly portrayals Tushar Kapoor irritates instead of entertaining, whereas Aftab Shivdasani remains okay as his close friend. Krishna as their common buddy once again becomes a victim of a bad script that fails to exploit his known talent on the bigger screen. Plus in the female cast there are girls willing to shed off their clothes as per the requirement, who just wished to be the heroine of a Hindi film, even if it is a 'porn-com' not in any way concerned about their acting talents. So we have Gizela Thakral and Claudia Ciesla trying to titillate the viewers through their repetitive 'suggestive moanings' and 'dropping pallus', along with the beautiful Mandana who also gets simply used as a leading glamour doll and nothing else. In addition the film also features Shakti Kapoor, Meghna Naidu, Darshan Zariwala and few forgettable cameos too that fail to lift up the proceedings in many manner.In the musical section, a catchy song among all mediocre ones is unable to make any impact due to the otherwise silly story progression. And the same can be said about the background score, editing and cinematography too trying hard to deliver individually. Actually being the major culprit behind this poor dud, director Umesh Ghadge tried to make a project assuming that the Hindi film viewers are ready to accept anything and everything in the name of sex, without caring about any enjoyable content in terms of funny sequences, witty dialogues or comic performances.In short, it's a film that has been blindly made to encash the controversial genre in a quick span of time with all available actors, shot in probably one schedule (with the location/bunglow also looking the same as last seen in Akshay's ITS ENTERTAINMENT). Hence you can watch it at your own risk if you must or in case you have become a big fan of Mandana post the latest season of Big Boss and wish to watch her on the bigger screen in much lesser clothes."
tt5290620,"I tried seeing this movie and could not even tolerate the first hour. I saw only till the interval. And believe me it can be called the worst movie of the decade. The story can be seen in movies of the 80's. Like the script writer wrote the whole script in a single weekend. The acting makes you think ""What were these actors paid? Like 10k Rs?"". No one knows how to act. Literally NO ONE. The jokes are same as the WhatsApp jokes you read everyday. Music is Okay. And please don't even ask about the editing. Even i could have done it better than them. (Maybe due to censorship). In all movie is just a waste of time and money."
tt5290620,"If you want to waste your money, even then please do not go to watch the crap. Give the money to poor in spite of this crap. 1 star is very overestimation, but it's the minimum so, i have to give 1. Watch 2 show of Airlift, you will never disappoint. But if you will see this, even god can not help you after 40 minutes. With some cheap songs and scenes, Ekta Kapoor thought to grab the audience. But I know everyone will understand about this crap within 20 minutes.Please spend the money in some other place where you can enjoy. You will regret your decision if you will watch. Please don't watch it. This film contains nothing, story, plot, comedy except skin show and annoying jokes. I think those are not joke. Prefer AIRLIFT."

tt5290620,"Is this one of the worst films of all time? No. It has its moments when it is quite entertaining. Most of the music is good. The story has plenty of potential to be entertaining. As such this isn't one of the worst films of all time. Sadly, neither is it a good film.Many of the characters are one-dimensional, and as the film progresses some disappear altogether for no apparent reason. While the story has the potential to deliver laughs, that's all they try to do with it. The porn aspect is used to solely because nudity and sex are funny!!! The film is also too long for what it is. It's a daft romp about someone trying to pull off a ridiculous deception, and the hijinks that follow as it unravels. It does not need to be two hours long. This is not a good film, but neither is it awful. It had potential, but it didn't live up to it, choosing to pad the run-time with too many cheap jokes instead of developing an innovative story. A solid 4/10."
tt5290620,"KYA KOOL HAI HUM 3 REVIEW- Here we goooo folks, the way Indian adult comedies going up and up nowdays looks like soon it will reach to Hollywood adult comedies flicks like American Pie. OMG what the hell i just saw. First of all i want clear that my rating will be based on Out of 8 Stars cause these kind of films doesn't come in Out of 10 Stars rating. Cause if we love movie then we easily rate it as we rate classics so rating will be less but it wont make any difference on movie's views or quality( we hardly find it in these kind of movies). So if i am not wrong then almost every Indian cinema audience has seen previous 2 parts of this series so we all know what we expect from this one. Trailer was hilariously presented to us to impress us and pull us to theater so i must say makers succeeded in that. But as we all know nowdays Censor board has became very strict when it comes to adult movies and more for Adult comedies. As expected many scenes and dialogs have been censored in Film screenplay. Lets talk about movie now, Film starts with its titles by showing some flirty and dirty scenes in animation version. Then leading actors introduction in their way means vulgar way. 2 jobless people gets offer from their friend to work in porn film and because of some circumstances in their personal lives they had to accept it. And here all Hilarious laughing riot starts. Credit goes to writer who wrote parody in sex comedy way of Hit Bollywood Movies. All mimicry scenes makes you laugh like anything. Then love at first side for Tushar and Interval.. Till interval movie succeeds to immerse you in film as we feel like Interval appeared very soon. After Interval it becomes completely different film. Back to back twists in every 5 minutes for every scene in same hilarious way to keep you laughing. Then Climax looks intentionally written to finish film soon which clearly looks childish. Film ends on a disappointing note. Acting- No doubts Tushar Kapoor and Aftab Shivdasani carried entire film successfully on their shoulders. I never expected acting from them as its not necessary for this film so they gave whatever director wanted. I don't know names of those scene show material heroins so i wont talk about them. The name i know is Krishna Abhishek who is 3rd best in movie after 2 leading actors. All 3 heroin displayed scene show without any hesitation, completely provided that vulgarity level to film what makers needed. Other supporting star cast was OK. Ritesh Deshmukh has done Cameo which doesn't include much to talk about it. Music- Really was there anything called Music in the movie. Not a single Hit song in screenplay. Movie could have easily been made without songs. Screenplay- It is kind of field which has to be excellent for other movie but not for this movie as this is complete sex comedy so all you need is keep audience laughing. And its only 2 hours film so it doesn't look boring at all. So there is nothing to talk about screenplay. Dialogues- Wow. The only word i have for writer. So many freaking hilarious dialogs which makes you laugh out loudly and force you to clap and shout, scream at the same time. Some dialogs are like too much funny but we realise after few seconds. Especially those when they spoil all Hit bollywood movies Hit dialogs in Adult way. Complete marks to dialogs. Direction- It is strictly OK as i personally feel better movie than this with this script could have been made. Still whatever Director did should be appreciated. Final words- Overall a good movie a complete package of Scene show,dialogs, vulgarity, hilarious scenes in short whatever we expect Film provides it. If i compare it with its previous parts then i say KKHH1 >> KKHH2 >> KKHH3. If you are fan of adult comedies then this is the film you should watch if not Must watch. Go and watch it to have fun for 2 hours by keeping your Film critic mind at home. 6/8 (6/10) Stars by me :)"
tt5290620,"In KKHH 2 only I got the feeling that the makers were no longer interested in the story but only in feeding us even more crass crude jokes. But my god did KKHH 3 take it to level even lower than the word ""low"" by completing converting it into a ""porn category"" film.The jokes are even more crass and crude in this film. Lots of skin show and overload and acting of lowest quality. Sums up why Riteish stepped away from this film and Aftab was selected. Lots of those same old ""popat"" jokes , same old ""laundry"" dude again coming back with his no more funny line ""mai laundi supply krta hu"" and again the old trend of this franchise of giving weird named to characters.This film marked the end of the KKHH franchise."
tt6200274,"I think I found this movie somewhere in a remote and dusty corner of the Netflix vault, and opted to give it a chance, solely because I hadn't seen any movies from the United Arab Emirates.Right, well I managed to endure about 25 minutes of this movie before I gave up out of sheer boredom. Yep, it was exactly that boring.The characters in the movie were indistinguishable from one another, and I don't even recall who was who. Every character was essentially one and the same because they had no distinctive personalities or traits.The storyline and plot was almost non-existing, and it wasn't much fun watching some middle eastern people just trying to make their vehicles drift along a small section of road.Honestly, there just simply was no point to this movie.I have no interest in returning to finishing watching ""Hajwala"", not even if I was paid to do so. This is definitely one of the most boring movies that I have stumbled upon in a long time."
tt6200274,"Bad acting and awful story, most of the time you don't know what's going on.2 Hours of my life wasted for this garbage movie, i wish i could give 0 stars."
tt6200274,"I really don't like it !
Performance of actors is so bad"
tt6200274,"Abeer is the only person who can act, and some funny guy at the beginning, moaning and sleeping on the back of his truck.Who even signed this movie off and said it was acceptable?!?!..This movie gives UAE a disappointing image which is sad and not true.Either do it properly or go home! You all need to get educated and stop chasing acting dreams..."
tt6200274,"I had the feeling that 2h of my life is lost. The movie is so bad that it forced me to write a review. The acting is embarrassing, and it is probably the first time some are being ""professionally"" recorded. Make-up and effects are a joke, changing dramatically between each scene - there is little to none consideration or review. There is no story, just random friends smoking cigarettes and claiming to have fast cars. It has nothing to do with excitement or action. On a second note, the subtitles offered are out of sync and filled with grammatical errors."
tt6200274,I thought I was watching a soap opera. Very much discredit to the car owners. Definitely Paid not self made . No respect for these clowns
tt6200274,"The worst movie everDamn those who brought you together to make this movie..Oh, its scandal. You made foreigners take a bad idea about our ability in cinematographic production..on what basis did you put two directors and two scripts, and the foreign series that made 500 episodes see that there is one director and one screenplay..what are you proud of? !! .. The voice on one side, the movements of the lips on the other, and the physical effects of acting are zero.. Every person is dressed and has a beard and a dagger to tell his girlfriend what do you think of me, am I beautiful.. I found someone in the investigation police who put a ship over his head.. The story is not understandable and not interesting. The voice is not clear.. I continued the translation even though I am an Arab.. There are no plots in the story.. If I were you, producer, I would not post it on Netflix.. I hope you forget about acting and work on changing tires for better.. Really, I wasted my life in Watch this movie."
tt6200274,"Acting is horrible, the storyline is confusing and hard to follow. Waste of time do not watch this movie."
tt6200274,"From the first minutes I noticed how boring and dull this movie is. But I still gave it a chance! I managed to watch it entirely!Big mistake, I just wasted almost 2 hours of my life for the most boring car movie ever! And don't get me wrong, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE cars! But this movie has absolutely zero sense, it just switches scenes with zero storyline. Cars are beautiful, but actors have zero life in them. You don't understand who is who, what is he doing and how they can take so many stupid decisions! Also I noticed they have a second movie released in 2018! I mean.... how were they able to create a second movie? The first one was a complete disaster!"
tt6200274,... I only associate one word with this film. Masterpiece
tt11529348,"I would have given it a 0, but unfortunately it's not an option. Not everybody should be able to make or to play in a movie."
tt11529348,"I decided to Watch this movie with some friends because there wasn't anything intresting at the cinema that we haven't already seen.We were expecting a so-bad-that-it's-good movie and we didn't take it seriously.However,this movie fails even as a dumb comedy to see with drunk friends.There were only 2 jokes that made me grin,the acting was somehow worse than a Neil Breen film and the ""plot"" is so cringe-worthy and predicatable that I'm surprised I didn't fall asleep.Long story short,just avoid this mess and don't give them your money, just watch it online if you're curious.If you really want to Watch a vlogger movie,go for Logan Paul's Airplane Mode,at least that s*it is funny."
tt11529348,I've watched snail walk past my house in 9 hours and it was more interesting.
tt11529348,This movie is absolutely garbage. Don t waste your time
tt11529348,"Every actor in this movie is a popular vlogger from Romania. The idea is stupid, the script is stupid.
This is one of the worst movies i have watched."
tt11529348,"I walked out of the cinema after 10 minutes, the acting is definitely cringe, awkward, failing to reach even the youtube vlogging level...shelly had such a dumb looking on his face, it's like steering though the screen directly to your soul making you feel ashamed for him..."
tt11529348,"I hated it. Too full of cliches, stupid jokes, 1.36 hours too long.
No, thank you"
tt11529348,1 star ... too much ! It's a joke move ! Not recomanded !
tt11529348,There is a chance that this will be the worst movie in history.
tt11529348,"I resist only 15 minutes to watch this movie. Bad, worst and full of old jokes."
tt11529348,"A collage of incoherent, vlog-like scenes - that was my impression at the end of 6000 extremely boring seconds.
The acting was deplorable, the main characters were extremely flat and emotionless, some actors were locking straight into the camera. It was awkward.
The naive love stories are fit for kindergarten, the action is lifeless and the comedy is (almost) absent. The simplistic dialogue makes the characters feel either bad and stupid or preachy and condescending.That being said, some secondary actors managed to animate a few scenes and the overall impression was that of a movie that is a bit better than 1 star. Still, not worth watching."
tt11529348,"The movie Indeed has a childishly screen play, but the actors were really good. I think the problem with the low rating is that the language is Romanian and with known Romanian actors.
It was a nice movies, Selly's play is very good, even the little girl has an impressive act.
Keep up the good work!"
tt11529348,"I lost interest in the first 10 minutes but gave it a second chance another day and I dont regret it now! The movie
script is indeed dull and silly but there are some good jokes and funny clichees that really made me laugh. I also saw Miami Bici and its pretty close, although a bit better (in my opinion)"
tt11529348,I think its just another cheap copy off an old American comedi film !
tt11529348,"A very bad movie.
Amatorical acting,ugly guys,irational idea"
tt11529348,Worst Romanian movie ever. Don't try to spend even 10 minutes with this rubbish.
tt11529348,This is the worst movie I ever seen in my life :)))
tt11529348,"Idiot kids making a movie like them, illiterate, unlettered, do not know how to speak their own language
I do not recommend this movie"
tt11529348,"It's a cheap jokes movie with some Romanian vlogger mostly kids, it should not be called a movie"
tt11529348,The bad acting is the best part of this production. Hurray for the godfather that helped this movie be produced!
tt11529348,"I liked ""Poveste de cartier"" much better than this joke. 1 is a fair raiting for a movie with so many wannabes actors."
tt11529348,"Worst movie,i regret buying the ticket,better buy a pack of ciggarets.I only watched it because of my friend.Now i measure my actions because time is limited and don t want to waste my life time"
tt11529348,"Definitely this movie is not worth 10 stars, however I am sure it's not the 'worst' movie ever. I don't understand why all of you are so mean with these kids... Romanian people should encourage them even if it wasn't the best movie ever, but it is definitely better than many other movies.
I never really post any kind of reviews, but it was so disappointing to read all the hate comments..."
tt11529348,"For me, the only reason for watching this movie, was the fact that Micutzu was part of it. I never regretted watching a movie as bad, as I do now. I honestly feel bad for whoever paid a ticket for this garbage of a movie.
Furthermore, Netflix, how the hell are you approving this joke of a movie?"
tt11529348,"I was expecting it to be bad, but hooooly smokes it was sooo bad, lame, cringeworthy, boring. An absolute waste of time, money, electricity and internet traffic. When I decided to watch it, I tried to omit my poor expectations of it, and give it a chance, but this was clearly the worst movie I ever watched."
tt13351440,I'm not sure how the creator of the show has not been sued by the creators of Indiana Jones and Night at the Museum? The animation is Excellent and some of the storylines are pretty good. But still for the blatant ripoff I will only give it one star.
tt13351440,"While I always appreciate diversity in the characters presented in shows, it doesn't make up for lousy production values, writing, voice work, music and story. It's neither educational nor entertaining. We live in a world where Bluey exists and Netflix is over here wasting time and money on this formulaic Night at the Museum knock-off. I hope the creator of this show, who has a thick resume of unwatchable children's programming, doesn't blow it with the upcoming Ada Twist Scientist."
tt13351440,"Ridley is so Cute, especially when her show is from the creators of Doc McStuffins and Vampirina which are my favorite Disney junior shows. As of now, Ridley Jones is the only show I like from Netflix Junior."
tt13351440,Cute new show that the kids are liking!Solid animation and entertaining.
tt13351440,"Cute show, a girl adventurer as the protagonist and love the characters and love the much needed representation. Ignore the trolls who are leaving bad reviews because they apparently cannot handle that a bison is non-binary or that a mummy family has two dads."
tt13351440,Cute little show that actually manages to make me laugh as well as my daughter. Love it.
tt13351440,My 5 year old adores this so much. It has great characters and fun adventures. Only a small amount of scary things and no violence so it's perfect.
tt13351440,"I personally think the show can be low quality at times, but other than that its great! It sparked a bit of discussion about gender, which seems to be the cause of the recent review bombs. We discussed it simply and he wasn't confused at all, at least he said he wasn't 😅 but i think the show also helped explain. But people who complain about pronouns here might be too stupid to have a conversation with their child about different people, and end up raising some very close minded individuals who only spread hate. I think the storyline was well done and the representation was very good! I have seen most of the episodes when spending time with said cousin and most have been amazing."
tt13351440,My 4 year old daughter LOVES this show and so do I! It's great seeing a little girl (and a girl of colour!) taking adventures. There are other strong female characters as well as LGBT representation. Really great show.
tt13351440,"Most of the bad reviews here are complaining about the inaccuracy of gay dad pharaohs, as if talking dinos are realistic. Great representation and really cute."
tt13351440,"This is a sweet show with fun concepts, a message of kindness and self authenticity, and beautifully imaginative animation. The adult characters are shown as good parents that the kids can trust and rely on, who are there to support them but also give the kids the space to take on responsibilities. Great messages all around. I was shocked it had such a low star rating - but then if you read the one star reviews here, they all are full of bigotry and close-mindedness against the concept of a diverse, inclusive, sweet kids show."
tt13351440,"Just listening to the theme song for the show will give you a good glimpse into what awaits: positivity and action. In the opening theme sung by Grammy-winning and Tony-nominated Broadway Star Lauren Patten, Ridley Jones is described as one who is responsible, never gives in to her fears, overcomes challenges, and is always willing to help her friends. Through the first season we see her grow and mature as she solves each quandary with the use of problem-solving, teamwork, and sound judgment.The show itself is a perfect blend of Indiana Jones (no relation?) and Night At The Museum, as the exhibits come to life and are cared for by Ridley, her mother and her grandmother, a multi-generational family of curators who ""save the future by protecting the past"" including the last dodo, a dinosaur, an astronaut chimp, a mummy family, and an adorable bison who resents being adorable.Common kid themes get tackled by the characters including fear, working together, and different family structures in a way that is accessible for kids as young as toddlers, but enjoyable even by adults. The rousing soundtrack is catchy without being cloying, and the songs are thematic, professional anthems one wouldn't necessarily expect from a kids' cartoon.Ridley Jones has an all-star cast and it really shows. Each episode is feature-quality, and the only downside I see is that you'll find yourself watching every episode countless times because there aren't enough episodes to satisfy the little fans of this well-written, well-cast delight of a show."
tt13351440,We have watched this on repeat since it came out. Our child now wants to work in the museum and be an adventurer.
tt13351440,"Ridley Jones is a cute series with colorful animation and features a number of fun moments for children to enjoy. The first season begins the story by introducing little Ridley and how she begins her mini-adventures with the museum beings. The concept is a children's version of A Night At The Museum and Ridley is a character clearly based on Indiana Jones. His companions are adorable and innocent characters with quite a bit of charm. Without a doubt, the beginning of this series assumes something very enjoyable for children.In the second season the series improves, presenting more exciting mini-adventures and the rise of Ridley as the new protector of the museum. The only details are that the season should have concluded with the fourth episode. The issue with Fred begins to become more noticeable at the beginning of this next season. In the previous season there were a couple of nods to respect that may have gone unnoticed. Here it could have been the same if the message he gave had remained only about being yourself, without the need to be like others.The third season is shorter and feels more random. Here Peabody becomes something of an unwitting villain, as seen at the end of the previous season, and it's curious that he still makes the mistake of not noticing anything suspicious when exhibits are out of place. Here the series begins to lower its level a little, making the second season better and perhaps that is where the series could have concluded in the most appropriate way.The fourth season improves the series again, still following the episodic series structure. There is a better balance in the writing with respect to the story and the morals, being perhaps the best season of the series. The fifth episode concludes the fourth season with a clever story about the value of working as a team and definitely should have been the series finale.The fifth season was made to continue offering more of Ridley's adventures and continue transmitting values, but without knowing that this season would leave the series unfinished. Although it starts with an interesting special and the other episodes present interesting ideas, this season has ups and downs that make it feel like an unnecessary season. In some episodes the problems are resolved faster than in previous seasons. The new ideas and characters that are presented are only momentary. Peabody no longer has so much antagonism due to his few appearances, but at least they were able to show more about this character in the semi-last episode to understand his attitude. In this season, some lessons begin to be given on more advanced topics in some episodes such as rivalry, competition, humility and identity. The latter was what would be used to reveal Fred's identity.The episode that generated impact was intended to teach a lesson about acceptance and self-confidence, but they did not know how to do it correctly. The mistake is that just being accepted with the identity you have is enough to face the challenges. It serves to have more self-confidence, but not to face conflicts. On the one hand, it helps those who have an identity crisis have more self-confidence, but that is not enough and the issue related to pronouns is opaque more than it should have been conveyed. Despite hints at Fred's identity, it was never fully clarified and remained ambiguous for the rest of the series. It would have been better if they left it that way because Fred was fine as a character just focusing on helping Ridley. Curious that Fred has generated so much noise after revealing his identity when at the beginning of the series we were introduced to Ismat's two fathers and no one said anything about it. What generated impact was nothing more than one of the lows that this fifth season had, but many thought that that was enough to devalue the series. At least they decided to conclude the season with a good adventure that could have given a definitive ending, but only left things behind. Perhaps it could have continued into a sixth season, but in the end that didn't happen due to a simple mistake.So, Ridley Jones had to be canceled because of Fred? The only right answer is no. It was a mistake that they decided to continue the series and it simply should have ended in the fourth season. Fred's revelation was also a unnecessary mistake. Many of the negative opinions towards this series only focused on this mistake, as if the entire series had depended on that episode. What is certain is that none of those people took the trouble to watch the entire series to see that there is only one reality regarding it. Ridley Jones is actually a series for children that, despite its ups and downs, is healthy and transmits good values. All negative opinions towards this series are invalid and without good foundations because they are based solely on a failed episode and paranoia that comes from the parents. In fact, many of these fathers are not even worthy of being father figures because it is clear that there lies a hidden prejudice that the younger ones can end up inheriting. This shows the lack of intellect and low IQ that many audience members have. Ridley Jones is no different from other children's series that try to convey good values and having a failed episode does not define the series in general at all. In short, Ridley Jones is a children's series like any other that children can freely enjoy and that should not be rejected too lacking in logic. My final rating, the only and valid one for this series, is an 8/10.This is the only valid rating the series should have because the other ratings belong to people of inferior intellect."
tt13351440,"My two year old loves this show. It is not historically accurate, but I wasn't expecting much seeing as it's about a museum which comes to life at night. I would definitely recommend it."
tt13351440,"Only listened to it with a polish voiceover and it rocks. Myself being a 80's kid it reminds me of wholesome kids shows and, frankly, I am surprised how it's able to convey a quite complex kid's experience in a fun and thrilling way. Well done."
tt13351440,"Seeing characters like Fred, who are confident in their identity and unapologetically themselves, makes me believe in the power of acceptance and self-love. It's inspiring to witness such genuine representation, where stereotypes are cast aside and intersectionality is embraced. Characters come from diverse backgrounds, each with their own unique blend of culture, identity, and personality, making the show truly special.As I watch the magic of the museum unfold on my screen, I am transported to a simpler time-a time when anything seems possible, and I can just be present and enjoy the experience. It's a welcome escape from the stresses of daily life, allowing me to relax, unwind, and embrace the joy that the show brings.Beyond the engaging storylines and lovable characters, I can't help but appreciate the immense work that goes into creating the show. The animation, character models, and attention to detail are truly impressive, capturing my imagination and whisking me away to a world of enchantment.The writing is masterful, striking a balance between delivering important life lessons for young viewers and developing characters in a way that resonates with older fans. The result is a show that appeals to audiences of all ages, fostering a sense of togetherness and shared enjoyment.In a world that can sometimes be overwhelming and complex, watching cartoons like Ridley Jones provides a comforting reprieve. It reminds me of the importance of kindness, acceptance, and friendship, and leaves me feeling hopeful and inspired."
tt13351440,My kids started watching this and have really enjoyed it. I caught a couple episodes and really enjoyed that the underlying message in the episodes I saw were about just being yourself and accepting others for who they are. In a world where kids are bombarded with so much this is a great theme I'm happy to have them be exposed to.
tt6910020,"The film is not very well produced. it is in the level of the many brazillian Novelas that are mass produced to air every day for months. 
The story is clearly fake, with hints at supernatural events and the attempt to make the one who paid for it a good person; It hides the facts regarding the way he got rich, by taking people's homes, salary and goods by making promises of riches and blessings. 
An imoral movie about an imoral person trying to wash away the well documented facts about his rise to power."
tt6910020,While I was watching the movie I only thought it was better to see Pele's film
tt6910020,"It's sad to see the art of cinema used for propaganda purposes. Of course it's not the first time, and it won't be the last.Objectively speaking, this is not a good movie. It lacks quality in all forms of the production: bad direction, barely acceptable acting and photography.The script is also lacking, but that's almost forgivable when you realize this is propaganda movie.So why this movie has such good ratings?This is a propaganda movie, made by a well known church in Brazil. It's a huge, extremely wealthy group, and they have the ability to pull this off. Their intention is, I believe, to both please the ego of their leader, Edir Macedo, and serve as a recruiting tool, to gather more members.They, most likely, have thousands of members coming here and writing fake reviews, with text clearly translated using Google Translator or similar services.And I think they will keep coming.I urge you look into this Church, and why it's so concerning to have this movie here, getting this kind of attention."
tt6910020,"Misdirected film, scenery with weak setting, tiring narrative, forced acting and false story. An attempt to create a martyr in the figure of a religious who manipulates people."
tt6910020,"It's a boring movie. It's not a biographical movie, most scenes do not reflect the reality of Edir Macedo. A movie full of religious cliche. Watch in case of insomnia."
tt6910020,"Not very good movie, a lot of errors, I really lost my time seeing it."
tt6910020,"I watch this movie and i can say the people are manipulated for high rating, bad movie, actors and theme."
tt6910020,Unfortunately the film portrays a very bad reality. Unfortunately it was made with money from church donations to spread the gospel in Brazil.
tt6910020,"Edir Macedo is not a hero like its shown in the film. He's nothing but a corrupt, charlatan and criminal."
tt6910020,"Watching this movie is the worst thing you can do to spend your time on. 
Full of fanaticism, zealotry and partiality. It only reflects how blind faith and dogmatism can be dangerous and manipulative. Other than that, this movie does not show a biography of someone whose life is blameless, it is more like a brainwashing attempt to cover up a very dubious past."
tt6910020,"How man of god produces this propaganda movie and pays for it is beyond evil. I hope there is hell, karma since using faith for greed is awfully wrong. I am not even religious person. As for movie itself, just trash, not even mildly entertaining."
tt6910020,"This is not an independent movie. It is about a Brazilian church owner, but financed by himself (with the money of church goers) to show him in a positive light, while in reality he got billionaire (he is the richest pastor in the world) by exploiting the faith of the poor.Avoid."
tt6910020,"For the people who know the real story, it's pretty clear they try to pass Edir as some sort of hero, a martyr, That alone makes you want to stop watching the movie less than halfway through it. So do yourself a favor, and don't even start, unless you want to see this as pure fiction and not try to compare it to the real history."
tt6910020,"An absolutely craptacular ""movie."" I really need to look more closely at the IMDB reviews and not just the overall rating. Self-financed propaganda by a charlatan fleecing the religious minded in Brazil (and elsewhere, apparently). Badly written, directed, acted and whatever else you can be bad at in a movie. The lead looks like a cliche of a pedophile and has zero charisma, even when preaching. Do you want to see a good faith-based movie? Check out ""I Can Only Imagine."" That movie proves faith-based doesn't have to be synonymous with garbage. Avoid this AND the sequel teased in the Avengers-style stinger at the end of the movie."
tt6910020,"This guy is a billionaire, while his faithful often have no money to eat. He built a church that looks more like a mansion. Horrible movie, where the guy's type is masked. Do not watch and use your time to research the fame of Edir Macedo in Brazil."
tt6910020,"Highly biased story as the main character is the owner of the main sponsor and production company. Not a biopic but an auto-biopic in the end.
Also, bad direction that feels very old style and doesn't help much the viewer that doesn't already know the character."
tt6910020,"This movie being rated 10/10 and being removed by imdb itself as a fraud is really a meme. As a movie lover, it's practically a crime for a movie like this to have been ahead (even for a few days) of movies like The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption and other classics. Due to this masterpiece imdb has updated its policies. As a Brazilian, I am sad that people have used the platform as a form of fake promotion of an obviously bad product."
tt6910020,"After watching the movie, I can easily say that I did find it uplifting. Setting aside the fact at it does deal with religion, what caught my attention was the courage this man had to go out and do what he wanted, to preach!!! It may sound like something so minute, so plain, yet I saw courage to face one's own fears and backlash of others. As I watched, I did not expect any exaggerated effects or extravagant details. Rather, real-life experiences that explain why the bishop and his church has been able to spread into so many parts of the world. With that said, what I came away with is that no matter what, I cannot let others define who I am or stop believing in my dreams, That is why I state that it is an inspiring film!!!"
tt6910020,"After reading some of the bad reviews on this movie, I can see why some think it's trash and not true. Honestly, the movie is not bad for Brazilian standards which is why I gave a generous 4 stars. It was nteresting to see how Macedo's life story would play out in the big screen. The setting and cinematography is decent in quality but I found it comedic that most of the character's who I knew personally portrayed in the movie, looked nothing like them in real life except for the actor playing Macedo who shows a good resemblance. I knew Macedo and his family personally from the early years of his church back in 1978. I was disappointed that my family was not mentioned in the movie because we sponsored them to begin his church mission in the U.S. in the early 80's and came to live with us in NY for a period of time. The movie ends with him and Ester in NY with no context of how they got there. If there's a sequel coming, it will be interesting to see how the plot turns out but don't expect a miracle LOL!!! The guy from his humble beginnings and life challenges, definitely dreamed of gaining power and fortune all in the name of the Gospel!"
tt6910020,"As a Christian who truly knows the Lord, I found this film truly appalling because it is not a proper account of events.The attempt to portray authentic Christian behaviour has failed miserably. I would normally stay right away from any person, calling themselves a Christian, who behaved in any way like the hero of this film. Unfortunately he comes across as a deluded nut, a religious zealot, someone one would expect to be repulsive to saint and sinner alike, and who does not appear to know very much about how to care for his wife.If I met a person like this I would immediately know that there was, before me, a person with very deep need. He speaks of wanting to save the world. Many people have been seized with a desire to save the world, but history books show us that God always deals very deeply with people he calls, the work of grace in the soul of man takes time, and unfortunately the film fails to portray the passing of very much time at all, or any Godly discipline to speak of in the life of this man.I would not recommend this film for the purposes of education or relaxation because it is so non-realistic as to be laughable."
tt6910020,"I had never heard about this guy before the movie and this movie certainly didn't help me: it looks fake and the actor that plays him reminds of Ted Bundy.
A nice story but probably not super realistic"
tt6910020,"I read diverse reviews on here, but overall if you watch the movie with no prejudice, regardless if you like Edir Macedo or not, you will see it's a great movie. It shows the reality of man who wasn't believed in, was put down, bullied since he was a child (the reality of many) and as an adult the struggles increased, but he prevailed against all odds due to his faith in God.The acting is good, the cinematography is excellent, they did a great job with the looks of the movie as a whole, the antique cars, clothing etc.I didn't see any part of the movie promoting religion, it was quite the contrary, it's against religion and promotes only having a sincere faith towards God as your drive.I recommend it. I left the movie theatre inspired and motivated to take the right decisions in my life."
tt0185183,"My spouse and I went to see this on opening night. We were expecting to see an extremely bad and costly film, and we were not really disappointed. It is a testament to John Travolta's genius that his career survived this disaster at all.As they say, garbage-in, garbage out. Start with an L Ron Hubbard novel (your first mistake) featuring a completely plagiarized dark-skinned, war-like and hairy alien culture with wrinkly foreheads (if this sounds like Klingons to you, I thought so too!), and add unfortunate Barry ""can't get a break"" (or maybe it should be 'cant pick a script') Pepper and all you need is Travolta himself - playing the arrogant, merciless, slightly effeminate and quite under-sized leader of the alien colonists. Remove any hint of character development from the script and use the worst of the worst black box technobabble explanations for plot devices. Finally, stay true to the idiotic gibberish you based the film on in the first place, and you've got the makings of a rolling-on-the-floor comedy.In fact, opening night, in a packed theater, people started laughing out loud about 20 minutes into the film and never really stopped. We had a great time that night. Halfway through the film more than half the crowd was actually interacting with the film, asking ""Mr Worf, where's Commander Riker?"" and asking troublesome questions about how many hundreds of years gas would remain viable in the gas-tank of a Harrier.If you need to know about the plot - it's this simple - Earth has been conquered by an amazingly stupid group of Klingon-like aliens, and the remaining humans live in a large domed slave labor camp where they are taught that their sole purpose is servitude because they are stupid, weak, etc. Barry Pepper somehow becomes convinced that he's not born to be a slave, and learns to fly a harrier, etc. It's really not worth the effort of typing. There are a few not-so-subtle and not very original but good messages about ethnocentrism to be found here, but not much else. Some day when you need a good laugh, rent this or borrow it from your local bad film collector."
tt0185183,"Has to be the worst film ever made, nothing makes actually sense, the filming, framing, style, tone filters, audio, editing, just about everything in this film is horrendous. 2.5 is too high for this film, this is the moment you wished a negative would pop up magically so you could push it further down."
tt0185183,"Actually, was anyone involved with this total disaster thinking at all? My personal guess: no, and if they were, I'd rather not know about what.None of the reviews have done BE justice. Having heard what a start to finish mess this was, my brother and I decided to watch it, just for fun. It was horrible beyond all our expectations - and not in a fun way. And so I can now tell anyone who's interested: You must see this movie yourself to realize the sheer magnitude of its badness, stupidity, and ineptitude. I've heard that BE cost about 70 million dollars to make - though how anyone could have greenlighted it is a great mystery. Since there was nothing on screen to indicate why it had cost that much, my brother and I have also worked out how the budget was allocated:* Travolta's salary, plus assorted managers and hangers on: 40 million.* Special effects, film, sets, costumes, makeup and hair extensions: 25 million.* all other salaries: $4,999,888.* script: $112 and change.Though that still doesn't begin to explain the end result. I give up. I'll never understand how Travolta managed to get BE made, or released, for that matter. Why is he tanking his career again? Who knows? After this, why should anyone care? Ah, well. I hope he finds something better to act in in the future; I honestly can't see how he could come up with something worse.I never thought I'd give anything a 1, but this is indeed as worthy a candidate as I've ever seen. So, * is my vote, and I'd rate it lower if it were possible. Just... incredible. Watch and learn."
tt0185183,"the friend who lent me the DVD warned me, but it beat all my expectations of lowliness. this film is unspeakably bad. don't go and see it, take my word for it:* it has no plot.* the 'actors' suck huge rocks. really huge.* travolta doesn't even try.* the most elaborate dialog revolves around the sentence 'grumble mumble'.* special effects are the worst ever, because they pretend to be serious.* costumes and characterization make space: 1999 look excellenti could go on and on and on, but i'm beginning to feel sick just for having to think about it."
tt0185183,"This monster flop has an interesting story outline filled with garbage. The aliens have weaknesses that make even the non-rocket scientist in the audience wonder ""how did these guys survive long enough to conquer anyone?"" The next question I found myself asking is this, ""How long would certain things (books, computer-dependent machinery, combustion engines) last and still be of any use to anyone?"" Too many things you see in the movie are simply beyond belief. But this is science fiction you say? Of course. The point is that the basic story could have been told without any of these ridiculous questions bugging the viewer if the people making it had just thought things out for an hour or two. I understand that suspension of belief is a requirement of sci-fi fans but you have to limit it to just what is necessary to tell the story you are trying to tell."
tt0185183,"This movie is a complete mess. Everything--EVERYTHING--about this movie sucks. The acting, the characters, the dialogue, the storyline, the camera angles, the tinted film, and even the very logic of it! If you want to teach someone about plot holes, pop Battlefield Earth into your DVD player. If you can find a copy; not too people have wanted to rent this movie, so copies of it are rare.This movie is painful to watch. It hurts my eyes because everything is so tinted, it hurts my neck because everything is so angled, and it hurts my ears because the acting is so bad. Oh, and trying to figure out why someone thought this would make a good movie gave me a headache. All that being said, I cannot hate this film like some other movies, and I think it's because no one thinks it's good. I feel like it didn't do anything to me. I didn't see it in theatres and I didn't rent it, it just soaked up a couple hours of TV time. And, I have to admit, it was a lot of fun watching how gut-wrenchingly awful this movie could get.And it got awful. People have called Plan 9 from Outer Space the worst movie of all time. I disagree. I firmly believe that Battlefield Earth is the worst movie of all time. It had a budget, so it had no excuse to be awful. This is the worst movie ever made. It's painful to watch, it makes no sense, and watching John Travolta, Barry Pepper, and Forest Whitaker act in this movie was like watching Goofy. Actually, I think I'd like to see a version where Goofy plays Terl.0/10"
tt0185183,"Battlefield Earth is without a doubt one of the most distasteful examples of cinema I have ever come across. That being said, I bought the DVD and have watched it about 8 times already. If you are like me, and you like sitting through a ""serious"" movie and laughing at how funny and bad it is, you should definitely check out this movie. Every time I watch it I find more and more hilarious plot inconsistencies, and the slanted camera angles and dialogue never cease to amuse. I guess since this film is somewhat affiliated with Hubbards hokey religion, there is no cursing to be found in the movie. Instead we get to hear how many ways you can use the word ""crap."" In several situations Travolta refers to specific unpleasants events as being ""crap-lousy."" It's hilarious and has to be seen to be appreciated. In conclusion, if you fancy yourself a MST3K type critic, you will surely enjoy this crap-lousy movie."
tt0185183,"Taken from that viewpoint the movie is simply fun. Granted it drags a bit in parts. But the over the top cheesy performances by Travolta and Whittaker save the day. They make villainy fun again.All these stupid movies these days take themselves so seriously. They're fantasy stop playing it so straight! Thats why the original Die-hard worked so well, everything was done with a wink and a nod. From the over the top New Joisey hero, to the subtly comic villain. This movie admittedly doesn't work as well as that one but everyone got wrapped up so tightly in the Scientology stuff that they didn't even give the movie a chance. As a cheesy B-movie sci-fi film it works acceptably well."
tt0185183,"This movie should have been a 'Project Redlight'. John Travolta is out of his head and hopelessly devoted to L. Ron Hubbard. That he was able to con 10 other people into investing $80 million towards the making of this movie is the only real impressive angle I can work for this review. Perhaps Travolta wanted to work with Tarrantino again and thought the only way that that could happen is if his own career fell into the tank? Or perhaps he felt it was his duty to make the film in order to get a better seat in 'Dianetics Heaven'? Let's hope that Tom Cruise can learn from Barbarino's mistake. I don't think it will matter too much to point out everything that is bad about this film, but the acting, the dialog, the special effects, the plausibility of the cave people's quick learning development, and of course, the hair extensions will just have to suffice.I would have given the movie a 1 out 10 rating, but I did laugh at the movie quite a few times and that should be worth something, I think. The version I watched was on the USA network and it was modified for teevee, so I may have missed some key plot elements that were cut from the original vision of its director, but then again I may have seen some really good Levitra adds in its place. The end credits whizzed by so quickly that it would appear that no one really wanted to have anything to do with this movie except Travolta.'In preparing a judgment of worth, I proclaim this lame movie to be worst' Don't forget that 'I told ya' to blame John Travoltaand L. Ron for Battlefield Earth.Oh, if it were only a musical. 2/10.Clark Richards"
tt0185183,"BATTLEFIELD EARTH (2000) 1/2 * John Travolta, Barry Pepper, Forest  Whitaker, Kim Coates, Richard Tyson, Sabine Karsenti, Michael MacRae,  Michael Byrne, Sean Hewitt, Kelly Preston (unbilled cameo). My  candidate for worst film for the new millennium: atrociously awful  Travolta vehicle (who is totally to blame for his co-producing this pet  project due to his Scientology ties) in bringing L. Ron Hubbard's cult  sci-fi novel to fruition is just one God-forsaken mess from start to  finish in what feels like the ultimate Ed Wood film with a dire need  for the gang from MST3K to show up and provide apt ridicule: Travolta  stars as 9 foot tall alien Terl, a Psychlo who commands his rampaging  race in wiping out mankind in the year 3000 with only rebel Pepper out  to thwart his nefarious plans of mining gold for his own just rewards.  Ridiculous from the get go: the make-up of the Psychlos: a combination  of dreadlocks a la Jar Jar Binks to the 'Coneheads' to the costume  rejects of any speed metal band of the 1990s; the dim lighting and  production design; the cheezy special effects (except for the climax of  Terl's planet - who the HELL cares if I'm giving away the ending?!! IT  SUCKS!!!) - which looked kinda cool!) and laugh-out loud dialogue:  ('Rat-brains' is the often reviled retort by Terl to the 'man-animals'  he despises). Travolta better get his mind straight because his  post-'Pulp Fiction' comeback is running on jet vapors at this point and  don't even get me started on his evil Vincent Price-inspired chortle!  UGGGHH!!! (Dir: Roger Christian)"
tt0185183,"Lemme get this straight: This is a post-apocalyptic film that takes place a thousand years after an alien race conquers Earth. Well, I noticed a few plot holes in this film.-- After 1,000 years, there is apparently no linguistic drift whatsoever. Johnny Tyler can pick up a book published in the year 2001 and read it just fine. Let's see, the King James Bible was written only a few hundred years ago and is nearly unintelligible due to linguistic drift.-- Books don't have thousand-year shelf lives. If you go to the Smithsonian, you'll find the curators go to extreme measures to protect documents that are only 200 years old.-- Are we really supposed to believe that stone-age barbarians can learn to fly fighter jets in just one week? It takes professional pilots years of training.-- Jet fuel does not remain stable for a thousand years. Most of the plastic components in the jest would have become brittle. The battery packs in the jets would have become unusable. The tires would have gone flat and the rubber would have disintegrated.-- I seriously doubt that our planet actually has enough elemental Gold that a high-tech invading civilization would still be mining it after 1,000 years. They probably would have packed up long ago."
tt0185183,"This movie makes you wonder why on IMDb we are forced to give a movie as dreadful as this a minimum of 1/10 when it quite rightly deserves a vote of 0/10.In all my life I have never seen such rubbish!The alleged ""acting"" unbelievable.What was John Travolta thinking when he made this pile of ......... ?All involved with this deserve to never be involved in the movie industry ever again.The ""story"" is unfathomable (is that a word?) , made not the slightest sense from beginning to end. Have not had to sit through something so silly and boring in all my life. Even if you are offered to see this at no cost , just run for the exit!!!"
tt0185183,"I knew this movie was bad, filled with hard to believe nonsense and horrible 'go America go' propaganda; so I had to see it. However this was way beyond my imagination. After returning the video I honestly asked the clerk that even when I'm very drunk to stop me from renting this movie ever again. Hopefully he'll remember that. Although the movie starts funny as we can see Travolta and Whitaker argue in their silly suits about slaves, this quickly turns to boredom. The rest of the movie is the standard very bad, short on budget Si-fi that can't interest any viewer with an IQ above sea level at all. The horrible thing is that the director hasn't even tried to convince you as the main character suddenly learns geometry (ok) and teaches it to his barbarian mates (huh?) who immediately appreciate the essence of it all (they ate raw meat as they have just learned what fire is). But then suddenly the standard IQ of these people goes sky-high: They understand atom bombs, know how to fly a Mig and work with highly cryptic computer interfaces. Check out the fact that the main character discovers the national library and finds a crisp fresh version of the constitutional law (it has been in that very same destroyed library for almost 1000 years and doesn't show any signs of decay ?) At has been a long time since I cried...."
tt0185183,"I hadn't seen this one before yesterday. It is REALLY AWFUL! There is NO REALISM here. NONE! Why do all the ALEEUNS (!) look like rejects from some bad rock band?Why do the ALEEUNS always treat humans as trash?Oh, right, GOLD! The Universe is full of gold so there is no shortage. There was a nice pile at the end. What the ALEEUNS did with the gold I have no idea. I do have a hearing problem and may have missed some things.Why the ALEEUNS built all those GLASS buildings I have no idea either. Seems like a lot of infrastructure just to mine gold.After 1000 years those old planes and weapons would be junk!This one is so bad, skip it altogether!"
tt0185183,"What a bad film this is. I thought the critics were exaggerating when they said how bad it was but they weren`t BATTLEFIELD EARTH is one of the worst films released by a major Hollywood studio. It`s badly directed , badly cast ( Barry Pepper as Jonnie makes for one of the least impressive screen hero`s ever seen . Maybe Travolta should have stuck to his guns and played Jonnie . He perhaps would have been slightly too old for the part but at least he does have some charisma unlike Pepper)  and has one of the worst scripts ever written. An alien race called Psychlos , sounds just like psychos , I bet they `re really evil and cruel . Oh they are evil and cruel just like psychos . Why do they think rats are the favourite food of humans when it`s the only thing they`ve seen humans eat ? And why do they think "" Rat brains "" is an insult to humans ? especially when they consider the "" man animals "" to be a primitive species . And am I alone in finding the term "" Man animals "" irritating ? Surely it should be "" Manimals "" ? A far sharper and clever expression . But sharp and clever is no way to describe this script . Cities stand almost intact after a thousand years since the collapse of human civilisation ! Not only that but so do large amounts of firearms , ammo and Harrier jump jets , and a flight simulator for the jump jets where the humans learn to fly within a week , and no doubt they`ll learn what petrol is and learn to put it in the jets in order to fly them . Does this sound very likely to you ? Let me put it this way: Go into a time machine and go back to the biblical times , capture a few dozen people , bring them back to the present and get them to become fighter pilots within the week. Do you think they`d be any good flying planes and shooting down enemy forces ? Me neither . Do you think they could overthrow a superior civilisation ? Me neither ? Do you think anyone involved with this film deserves to work again ? Me neither"
tt0185183,"...not because Travolta is in dreds, not because of the alleged scientology subliminal messages, but because it is one of the worst movies ever made. 
I do not use that term lightly.  I consider myself a lover of bad movies, movies that can be enjoyed for their lack of success.  ""Battlefield Earth"" goes well beyond that into the realm of slow torturous pain.I saw this movie because I expected it to be bad, and even I was shocked at how bad it was.  Just plain bad.  In nearly every respect.I suppose I should note that the ear-bleeding sound effects sounded pretty realistic.  And they were loud.  So the guy who did the sound shouldn't be ashamed.  Everyone else that worked on this movie, bow your heads.Director Roger Christian has put together one of the worst movies sci-fi or otherwise that I have seen.  Loaded with uninteresting characters, a dumb plot, ridiculous gaping holes in logic, terrible direction, only so-so special effects, and a huge length for a movie this bad (over two hours), ""Battlefield Earth"" is already being compared to ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" In my book, it's a fair comparison.Take the direction.  Sure Ed Wood had no clue what he was doing, but at least he pointed the camera directly at the actors when they talked. Christian decides he's going to be original and tilt the camera at least 45 degrees everytime someone says anything.  The whole movie I was tilting my head side to side, trying to keep up.The effects, well ""Plan 9"" had pie tins in strings.  ""Battlefield Earth"" has a couple of nifty CGI effects, but the final length battle sequence is filmed in a very dark blue setting, rendering it impossible to see who is shooting who at any given moment.  Of course, even if I had known it wouldn't have made much of a difference because I really didn't care about any of the characters one way or another.Gaping continuity?  Well, ""Plan 9"" had scenes in cars that began in the day, then turned to night when people got out of the cars.  In ""Battlefield Earth"", the Psychlos can discover gold veins in difficult to reach mountains, but somehow totally miss out on Fort Knox, still completely stocked with gold 1,000 years in the future.  Cavemen learn not only to speak and work together, but operate Harrier jets within a week.  How did they learn you ask?  Well on a Harrier jet flight simulator of course, somehow still working on electricity 1,000 years in the future.  More?  The cavemen communicate with walkie-talkies in the final battle.  How do they still work?  They found fresh batteries?  Next Duracels I see, they better say ""Best if used before 3005.""Is ""Battlefield Earth"" worse than ""Plan 9""?  I'd have to say yes.  ""Plan 9"" is so cheesy and goofy you have to laugh.  Just fun to watch.  After about an hour of ""Earth"" I wanted to hurt someone.  After two hours and it was still going, I wanted to hurt myself.  Avoid, even for lovers of dumb movies."
tt6280858,An amazing story on paper but the execution was quite dragged. It's a lot of cat and mouse chase but everything seemed very unnecessary and unnatural. Not to mention some continuity problems.
tt6280858,Not bad. Can be better attempt. I could have read the reviews before watching the movie. Wasted time
tt6280858,This movie has the capacity to make anyone from a saint to a psycho killer. It never even had a storyline that could be taken as a short film. It just get on your nerves. Never watch this movie even for free
tt6280858,"This movie lost it's catch in the beginning. I could not find any valid reason for the screenplay and the story line. Felt sad for those who have a perfect script in hand but never given a chance. This director wasted time and money for a movie which gave me nothing, I was exhausted. Nothing much."
tt6280858,Worst of time and money..... 2019 BIGGEST FAILURE MOVIE... NAYANTHARA ACTING LITTLE GOOD OTHERWISE WORST
tt6280858,"1.can give 9/10 for Nayanthara's acting
2.Worst remake of the hush.
3.Nayanthara acting is best but she shouldn't choose these kind of dumb movies.
4.movie plot is so much dumb.
5.wasted my valuable time for watching this
6.best example to prove that acting and the actor is not enough for a movie to be a good movie"
tt6280858,"Worst ever movie. I watched the movie by skipping 10-10 seconds. Very week plot. Completely wasted the casts. Recording and dubbing is very worst. These kind of movies require an awesome sound engineered. Music really killed it. Unwanted CG. Kolaiyuthir Kaalam is Sujatha's finest Novel, please revoke the title. How to un-see this movie?"
tt6280858,"TIME WASTED!
One of the worst making a movie could ever have!
The plot was satisfactory, camera work was good enough but the overall making of the film is so bad especially with the cat&mouse kinda game in the puzzle maze that it makes you wonder how they could even think of others watching this crap in a theatre."
tt6280858,"Yes, it is a cheap remake of the movie Hush, with unnecessary storyline and character motives. But the one person who made the movie more horrible to watch was Yuvan. His background score through the movie was so annoying and irritating. It was loud and the choice of music used was sickening. He really made a poor movie horrible to watch."
tt6280858,Good Performance by the lead actress NayanThara. Cinematography was also good.It felt that the story strength is somewhat weak.One time watchable.
tt6280858,Stupidest movie ever watched. Dont waste your time
tt6280858,Worst movie that I've seen in 2019. Rating this movie itself is a waste of time..... Never ever try to watch.....
tt6280858,If I would have read the reviews I wouldn't have watched the movie.
tt6280858,"Utterly immature movie making. With such a great location, one would have expected a classy movie"
tt6280858,Nayanthara and the Masked Man in a big bungalow is what we have to watch 80% of the movie.. that too continuously. 1 mark or the last scene or end...
tt6280858,"No story, very poor direction. I'm not sure why Nayanthara signed up for this"
tt6280858,"Actress Nayanthara highly reputed and respected for her good movies and action. She should consider before signing up movies like this. Director Chakri Toletti, please review your story and screen play. One good thing that I can say about this movie is some of the camera angles/shots are good."
tt6280858,"This movie is the worst, stupidest, and most idiotic film I have ever seen in my entire life.. such a waste of time watching it. It does not even deserve a rating of 1. If only there is a rating of 0 (ZERO!!!), then that's what this movie should get."
tt6280858,"Saw the movie in DVD
Not a bad one comparison all the regular Tamil movies with songs, comedy, fight and all other stupidity that we have been seeing for decades 😔😣
The problem is that the admin team under appreciate the audience and try to over compensate through screenplay and that kills the delivery of the plot which is the case here as well.
Overall it is a better movie to watch than most (98%) of the Tamil movies.
Yes it is an adaptation of a Hollywood movie but this is better than watching those stupid ones."
tt10662450,Extremely superficial. Feels like a Netflix promotion of their anime productions.
tt10662450,"Bottom line, I got more about the insights of manga and anime from the first 5 minutes of the Transformers episode of The Toys That Made Us and those 2 minute segments the Space channel use to have.This laughable excuse of a documentary had no direction at all, and seemed to glaze over Japanese culture and its association with anime.Plus no early anime like the 1960's Astroboy -- let alone Namakura Gatana from 1917. It's mostly disjointed interviews of modern producers of anime with editing effects that hurt the whole thing, and seemingly random vids of Japan.They should have taken a few notes from Trekkies or something to make it watchable -- let alone explore."
tt10662450,This would be miserably disappointing even as a first draft to a documentary about anime. How did this even get made?
tt10662450,"Please do not waste your time watching this, for the following reasons:1.) It is not informative or entertaining. The documentarian/narrator is clueless on the topic and offers no meaningful insights.
2.) It is artless garbage, with editing so poor that it is close to physically painful.
3.) Its condescending oversimplifications of Japanese culture are extremely embarrassing to have to hear.
4.) It isn't even a documentary, its mainly a promotion, as the majority of the shows discussed are recent ""Netflix Originals"" rather than iconic or well-known series.So please don't watch it, if too many people do than Netflix might get the wrong impression and make more utterly unforgivable rubbish like this. A true dumpster fire."
tt10662450,I felt so insulted watching this spot made by idiots who ignore everything about anime (or Japan) that I just had to revenge and post a dumber review. I love Netflix but everyone involved with this documentary should get fired. What a poor way to talk about anime and to put images together.
tt10662450,"Love anime, this movie made me wanna shoot my brains out after 15 minutes."
tt10662450,"This documentary expends most of its time on random monologues narrated by the author, most of it bring no information about the subject of anime or japan.
The fact that the person doing the documentary states knowing nothing about anime also doesn't help, simply because the questions you may be interested are never asked. The interviews are mostly a waste of time for the professionals, the pace is cringe, and you will not learn anything new even if you have never seen anime. Gladly its short."
tt10662450,"My disgust for this title pushed me to reach for my laptop, sign up to IMDB and type a review for the very first time. That is how much anger I felt towards Netflix's horrific, cringe-worthy piece of garbage. I wish I could say anything constructive, but this is a superficial view of what anime is or how it started and it's real reflection of Japanese culture and imagination, it's vehicle for fantasy and the language of its people. I hated the narrator I thought I didn't care for her initial ""I knew nothing about anime"" and ""i should google what is anime"" intro or the lame childish voice-over script of ""japan is this!"" -insert visual- ""and this"" -other visual-, and ""that's cool right?"". The very first person she hosts (i'm not sure why in the world would any documentarian start with non-japanese anime producers in LA) Is the producer of castlevania (which is not a bad... ""anime-inspired"" animated series) and everything he utters out of this mouth makes you feel like he's a pretentious idiot, ""oh i picked up the phone and this guy was like, hey I'm kanye"", and ""I'm a time traveller"". Just. God. Awful.Maybe further in the film there's some useful piece of information, but this did not grab me enough to want to continue and reach that part."
tt10662450,"Lost me when she called anime a medium. one giant netflix ad either way. no real thesis to the ""documentary"" either, just rambles on and on eith no point."
tt10662450,"Being nearly 40, and an anime fan for 30 years(ish), I thought I'd give this a bash. Oh God.It's so bad, it'd make GCSE Media Studies student blush.Tania tells us she doesn't know what anime is, and she's going to find out! Oh boy. She then fleeces Netflix for a free trip to Japan, and the following happens:1)She doesn't actually investigate or explain what anime is.
2)She starts roping in random bits of things she sees in Japan. Oh a Lolita goth! Dancing Elvis! Music! Food! It's all a bit cliché and grasping.
3)It's really flimsy on detail. At one point, she says she still feels like she doesn't know what anime is, so ""time to call in the big guns"". This translates as learning what some guys favourite colour, food and so on is. Wow.
4)We learn what some of the directors would be of not in anime... Which we don't need to know.
5)It's one big advert for Netflix Original anime. Let's face it, most of these are ""ok"" at best.I thought it may be better as a series, but then realized that would just be a pile of fresh hell.Do yourselves a favour, try to find The South Bank Show anime/manga special from about 10 years ago; it's a great overview of anime/manga/Japanese culture.TL:DR:
Clueless lady fleeces Netflix for a free trip to Japan, fails to discuss anime, advertises Netflix own mediocre offerings.Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. I made 4 coffees during this and it felt longer than 58 minutes."
tt10662450,I really enjoyed this fun journey into the anime world. I love the cinematography and the way the story was told! I hope there is more to come this was such a cool doc especially for anime and Japan lovers!
tt10662450,"I really like how it was filmed ! And particulary, the '' instagram's story like'' moment which gave it a personnal view and fun approche of the subject in a way that it does go with its time (come on ... how many of us spend their time on snapchat and sort ?!).On the other hand, I can easily understand why otaku (manga nerds) would be disapointed. You cannot reduce such vast subject easily into an hour long documentary and cover everything (it's like describing the Renaissance... way too vast !!).
And in any case Hardcore Fans are always disappointed whatever the subject is and how it is treated !Personally, I just wished they talk a bit more on where does they come from. On how after WWII japanese try to get their moral and pride up again. but then again we talk here about a very large subject, that is anime. Which is a medium of expression differnt of traditional manga, even if they are related.
In the end, it is a documentary for neophytes who don't know anything about it and try to understand what all this fuzz is about, approched in a genuine and personnal way."
tt10662450,"You could make a drinking game out of all of the times the narrator curses for no valuable reason or how many times she says she doesn't know/still doesn't know anything about anime.As others have said, this feels more like an hour long commercial than any sort of actual documentary. It has absolutely no value to anyone that is familiar with anime and even less for people wishing to dive into the medium.She tries to portray these artists, producers, etc. as eccentric, otherworldly characters instead of real people. She jabbers on and on about things that really don't seem like actual coherent thoughts.She knew nothing about anime, and now, as a life-long viewer of anime; I feel like I know less than I did when I started. That's how bad she is."
tt10662450,"If this was a true anime exploration and understanding documentary then where is Naruto, Detective Conan, Full Metal Alchemist and most importantly One Piece. Eiichiro Oda, creator of One Piece, is one of the top most hard working people in the anime/manga industry.All the anime featured in this movie are animes exclusively only from Netflix. The girl that made the movie was so unqualified in making it. At first I thought oh its refreshing because it's a new perspective. But what the heck happened?! It was all just advertising the Netflix anime series. I understand how hard you make a movie. But this was just trash. Pure advertisement. Label it correctly."
tt10662450,I watched anime for a couple of years now and also read quite a lot of manga so I think i know enough about the subject. This documentary doesn't really help with learning about the industry except for a few interviews with some creators and people that are involved on the industry. I also disliked the editing and the fact that it's pretty much a giant advertisement for Netflix.
tt10662450,"That's not a documentary, but the promotional video made by ignorants"
tt10662450,"This is so bad it made me sad. From cringe interviews, sorry, in the grand scheme of things what is Castlevania? I do not even categorize it as anime. I don't understand the point of this film apart from being free add for Netflix productions (as most reviewers already said). As an anime fan I was really disappointed, I would hope they would take it down after the bad reviews, this is awful."
tt10662450,"This feels like a interviewer who doesn't know anything about Anime culture is making a giant Netflix commercial, by coincedentally only interviewing people who are making Netflix Anime and especially the ones who make anime nobody really likes with a few small exceptions.
It also is really interesting that the interviewer constantly refers to American Cartoons, which are influenced by Anime as Anime and to Manga as Comic Books, which will have every Manga reader screaming out of the top of their lungs. When I see this Movie I cant help but have a great Idea for a new Netflix documentary: A catholic Preacher making a documentary about the Porn industry."
tt10662450,"I'm pretty sure that in addition to Googling ""What is Anime,"" the narrator also had to WikiHow ""How to make a Netflix commercial,"" because that's all this is.
Next up, the YouTube documentary ""Enter the Journalist"" featuring and narrated by PewDiePie."
tt10662450,"This is Netflix advertising itself on your dime. They tasked a director with that already had a deal in place with Netflix, do make a documentary about the anime that is available on Netflix. There's no context, no explanation nor objective view on the subject of anime. Same on you Netflix"
tt10662450,"Do not watch it if you are already an anime fun, it is not a show aimed for you, but neither of you are not. I'm okay with the show being aimed to newbies to the genre, but that shouldn't mean you can make such an uninformed and disrespectful documentary (anime is sold as something for crazy-minded people that now had become kind of ""cool""). Furthermore, its only fuction seems to be promoting Netflix original anime, I could be okay with that, but don't make it this obvious. Even some of the titles promoted are some of the worst anime that came out recently and are sold like gold, this way you won't conviene anybody. It is so embarrassing, Netflix should just delete it from its libabry."
tt10662450,Loved the film and editing! It's very entertaining. Didn't know much about anime before.
tt10662450,"For someone like me who is a seasoned anime watcher, it's so refreshing to see something like this be made as it means that anime is becoming more and more widely accepted. This fits with netflix's new age doco style and is definitely worth a watch."
tt10662450,I think Netflix should just remove this documentary and we all should just forget it ever happened like some kind of embarrassing thing from last night.
tt2909396,Watch this movie only if someone has given you a punishment or put a gun onto your head.What happens when all the Bollywood comedians come together in a movie ? The produce a below average comedy
tt2909396,"Stupid useless movie, don't waste your time. I couldn't even bear for 15 mins, it is such a torture."
tt2909396,"There is one thing when jokes are taken in good humour. But this outright racism, making an entire movie on the account of Santa Banta jokes(that too terrible ones). Sikhs have done a lot for India and the community but still are the center of jokes. The outright courage/stupidity of the producers was to give a disclaimer in the beginning that this movie is dedicated to all the sikhs who have contributed to the society by either giving their lives or working hard in their profession.Is this the tribute you pay? By insulting them?The producers won't understand this but whatever religion you are imagine yourself sitting in a movie theatre with a group of people of different castes laughing at jokes of your entire race? The producers won't get it. I'm surprised senior actor such as Boman Irani didn't get it.Next time try making jokes at Islam and see if the movie even releases. Just terribly sad state of affairs in Indian cinema. The makers and actors should be ashamed of themselves. Absolutely disgraceful!"
tt2909396,"Spy comedy has great potential, with the Johnny English franchise being more than enough to prove my point. Directing is poor and lazy. Even good comedy actors haven't been able to deliver an even remotely funny comedy. Story is boring. Don't do what I did and waste your time and money."
tt2909396,Wow what can I say amazing film best comedy vir dad boman irani played very funny roles music was brilliant 10/10 must watch neha and Lisa great acting and roles Sanjay mishra and ram kapoor amazing roles and props to sonu Nigam vikas bhalla mika Singh and diljit dosanjh for providing wonderful music.
tt2909396,"This film reminded me of the comedies Bwood produced during the 2000-2010 era. Based on the foolish pair of Santa Banta , the film shows how they are put in a secret mission and how they ultimately fulfill it, all without them knowing what is even happening.Santa Banta jokes are pretty popular but then again they don't highlight the Sikh in a right way. By showing the Santa Banta pair as down level foolish, they have ended up insulting the Punjabis instead.I will agree the level of foolishness of Santa Banta shown in this film after a certain time becomes so irritating that you start to feel your skin crawl with cringiness. Some of their parts were genuinely hilarious like them confusing Sonu Sultan 's name was the best part for me. Other parts were just too silly to even laugh at. Santa Banta jokes are acceptable at just written jokes level but transitioning them on screen becomes a fustrating watch because you just cannot digest the insane level stupidity that film throws at you every minute.Despite being insanely stupid, the film does have some genuinely funny moments that i had a real good laugh . Some of Santa Banta conversations were genuinely funny. Bahadur (Johnny lever) was the star for me. His awkward Nepali accent was really funny especially when he says ""Muja lao"" and his partners think he wants his face burnt but actually that was his way of saying ""Moja lao"" (bring me the socks) and bahadur constantly getting calls from his master to open the gate (well this part many will say as again an insult to nepalis calling them gatekeepers).The screenplay is very poorly assembled. It just randomly moves ahead with no flow whatsoever just to incorporate the funny moments. Songs pop up out of nowhere especially that one song where Santa Banta dance with the girls was so random i was taken aback actually. All in all, theres actually no story no screenplay, just they wanted to show a rather ummm...racist comedy film.Overall, a film that reminded me of the old Bwood comedies from the 2000s but can only be enjoyed if you (can) throw away those racist thoughts in your brain for a 100 mins or so but still as i said, the stupidity reaches to such absurd level that you will definitely feel your skin crawl with awkwardness and cringiness. No this film can't match up to any Bwood comedy from the 2000s ."
tt3724898,"Two teenage girls, Ria (Subholina Sen) and Payel (Ananya Biswas), meet up with Pele (Soumendra Bhattacharya) and his brother Babai (Ranodeep Bose) for a night on the town, after which they plan to find a hotel for some casual sex. This being India, however, where sex before marriage is a big no-no, they are unable to find anyone willing to rent them a room, so the horny foursome hide in a shopping mall until after hours instead. Once the lights all go off, the teens find themselves face to face with a weird elderly couple who entice them into playing an ancient, evil version of the popular board game Ludo that feeds on blood.Not being well versed in Indian horror flicks, I am unsure as to whether a shopping mall is a popular setting for such movies, but it's the second in a row for me, my previous Indian horror experience being the absolutely lousy Darr @ The Mall (2015). Ludo isn't any better. Darr's highlight was an energetic song and dance routine (which says a lot about the rest of the film); Ludo's strongest point is its occasionally rather nasty gore, which includes eyeball gouging, gut ripping and tongue tearing. But both films suffer from a plot that makes very little sense.Ludo's 'Hellraiser meets Jumanji' evil board game is a neat idea that offers plenty of scope for scary moments, but co-directors Qaushiq Mukherjee and Nikon fail to make the most of their concept, instead offering up lots of random creepy imagery without much of a coherent story-line; when the narrative is so confusing, it's hard to engage the viewer, and even harder to scare them silly. Worse yet, the second half of the film changes tack completely, forgetting about the teenagers to focus on the backstory of the game and its original victims, resulting in a horribly disjointed mess of a film that makes for a very frustrating experience."
tt3724898,"Me and Indian cinema have not had the best history together, though I've watched many I could only name a few and generally even those I didn't really like. I think the best I ever watched was Vicky Donor (2012) and even that was a remake of a French Canadian film.However I put my fears aside and gave this a chance because I liked the sound of the concept. Based on the description it sounded like it would fall into a sub-genre that I love, that it would be something in the vein of SAW (2004). Rest assured it's not that kind of movie at all.It tells the story of two young couples who after a night on the town are looking for a hotel room to have some private fun in. Struggling to find one they instead break into a mall only to fall foul of a mysterious old couple.It's a hard movie to categorize, it's rather an odd creature but what I can say with confidence is that it's awful. No really, this is even a low 2/10.Though it starts interestingly enough it quickly descends into confusion as soon as the plot reveals itself. It's just not engaging, the story makes very little sense, far too much of it is presented in the form of flashbacks and narration and ultimately it goes nowhere.Once again Indian cinema proves that it just isn't for me and conned me into watching another dire effort with promises of something it didn't deliver.The Good:Starts off interestingly enoughThe Bad:Stock screamsPlot is awfulRidiculous random imagery"
tt3724898,"I am fan of the foreign horror genre, so needless to say i was excited to view this film. Foreign horror films often contain more in depth mythos and psychological scares than the mainstream films. The idea of this film was very interesting yet failed to deliver. The pacing was too slow and scattered and despite the typical gore, Ludo failed to grip me. The scenes combined with the soundtrack felt solely for shock value ( a la Martyrs sans story line). The first act was, albeit too long, supposed to flesh out the characters. Which it did. It gave the viewer a sense of the environment and what is culturally accepted and not. Then, it switched from being a 'slow-burn'into a music video that bombards your ears with industrial type beats and seizure inducing lights. From here you are magically whisked away to a non-nonsensical time shifting quick explanation of the cursed game complete with gore and not much else. To say more is really irrelevant. Many will disagree, but if you are curious in viewing this, it really wouldn't hurt skipping some scenes and just skimming through the rest to arrive at a flat ending."
tt3724898,I mean WTF!!!??? I thought That I had bad movies but This is the worst!!!
tt3724898,This is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Tedious; unnecessary gore and imaging; stupid plot. Avoid at all cost.
tt3724898,"I personally love watching horror movies of all types, especially if they are foreign movies. With that being said, I don't think Ludo is a film for everyone. I thought this movie was going to be about zombies when I quickly skimmed through the summary and all I could remember was ""shopping mall"" and ""gruesome"".The film starts off with a couple of teenagers trying to get laid. They wound up in a shopping mall when they couldn't find a hotel room for the night. As the couples' begin to get into the good stuff, an old man and woman come out of no where. They get the teens to play an evil board game with them. That's when things get really crazy. I'm not going to say what exactly happens but that the film goes into more depth of the origins of the evil board game.OK, so the concept of the film was interesting and the acting wasn't too bad. There were some scenes that I thought were pretty cool/creepy. The story started off pretty simple and then it just felt like it was trying to do TOO much. As the movie progresses, it focuses entirely on the evil game that I just kind of forgot about the teens. The special effects were pretty good in my opinion but it was also too much for me. Overall I enjoyed it as a late night horror movie to watch but I'd only watch it once. The story could have been so much better. It's a different feel of horror and that's what I liked about it. So in the end...I like it and I don't like it."
tt3724898,"I am a huge fan of Q. Huge is an understatement but Ludo did not meet even 20% of my expectation. When I found Ludo was on Netflix I was elated and I spent my Thanksgiving afternoon glued to the screen. I have never felt so disappointed. Rii is as usual amazing but whoever did her voice for the movie ( I assume it was meant to be a Sakchunni - Bengali married woman's spirit) sounded ridiculous, raspy and horrendous. The four main characters are shallow and by shallow I mean not an ounce of depth. I grew up in Kolkata and I can vouch for the fact that we don't use so much of swear words in our daily vocabulary. I Know impressionable men and women feel that using swear words would be cool but it was a bit of an overkill. Tilottama Shome as the Shaman could have been explored much much more. I was left with a palate of bile after the movie. It could have been so so much better had some of the background story been omitted and stress put on the present day scenario of the Shaman's existence. Over all, I think it is a mess."
tt3724898,"First the positives: I actually sat through it all. Yes indeed I did, I kid you not. And while you may laugh at that notion, wait until the movie starts and the amateurish nature takes over. Now maybe you have a soft spot for that and there would be nothing wrong with that. It's just a shame, that instead of relishing in certain aspects, the movie tries to be something it can not be. Budget wise, story wise and anything to do with wise/wisdom at all.There is blood, there is almost nudity (though you could argue that there is a lot of skin shown for a movie from India) and there is horror. Though the horror aspect may come from a different place that you think. The make up isn't that bad though and the wicked, if completely mental ending almost is a saving grace. Then again, I'm not sure many will make it until then ... pun intended"
tt3724898,"I really like this movie. I see some stupid people give bad review for this movie.
I am sure they don't know bengali language. 
my question for them, if you cannot realize whole matter then why you need to talk about it???
If they can understand movie language then they don't put this bad ratting"
tt3724898,"I'm a bit surprised that there are only negative reviews here, because I genuinely enjoyed this off-beat little film. It's certainly no masterpiece, and the storyline is a little thin. However, in my opinion it was enjoyable anyway. The main characters are charming, silly students trying to stretch their legs and break some rules only to encounter something extremely strange going on at the mall.
I guess what I found most enjoyable was the looming, disorienting atmosphere and some extremely well-done makeup/FX that made for some genuinely beautiful, creepy imagery. The storyline kind of jumps all over the place, which is a bit jarring, but I didn't mind. To me the more confusing aspects would've been fine had it not been so long.
Most Indian films tend to be on the long side--- this one didn't need that. The pacing is a bit strange, but there's quite a few humorous moments balanced nicely with some tense, surreal bits. Perhaps I liked this more than other people did because I didn't go into it expecting a scary horror movie (it was a random pick). I had only the most vague description of the film, and at first I expected it was going to be some goofy teen movie. It isn't really a ""horror"" film, it veers more into a surreal, kind of artsy zone, which is honestly pretty unexpected the way it starts off. This would probably annoy a lot of people (especially if you were hoping for some legit horror), but I thought the concept was fun.
Overall, the fragmented narrative and sometimes awkward pacing didn't ruin the concept for me, and it's still far better than most average Hollywood horror films. Give it a chance, especially if you like artsy films and/or are on mushrooms."
tt3724898,"Like watching 2 separate movies! The 1st some sort of low budget hand cam slice of life from India, which was fairly interesting, but the characters were hollow and pointless. The 2nd was extremely interesting, a story about a game, similar to the game box in Hellraiser, which begs you to solve it, and if you don't, your body is forfeit, if you do your soul is. The board, like the box mesmerizes you, and you must play. If the 2nd half was more developed and a movie on its own, it would be a GOOD movie, but the first half, and the end, which happens in LITERAL FLASHES, and up close shots of faces, so you can't tell which of the 3 women you're looking at, what time you're looking at, it RUINS the end, because you DON'T know what happened!!! BOO!!! I even went back and watched it in slow mo, and if what I THINK happened happened, it would make no sense, because it would mean things in the past would make things in the future different....Watch if you dare, because it will only leave you confused."
tt3724898,"A Bengali-language horror seemed to have an interesting premise so I gave it a shot. Big mistake. This is an incompetent mess. A painfully overlong first act focuses on four foul-mouthed, unlikable teens partying and driving all over the subcontinent on mopeds looking for a place to hook up. The segment seems to have been written with an immature teenage boy's perception of how casual dating works. Anyway, the group finally settles on hiding in the mall overnight, where things go from dumb to stupid with the arrival of decrepit ghouls and a supernatural board game. There are a couple effects scenes that seem to have consumed the entire budget. Otherwise it's like something junior highschoolers shot and edited on a camcorder."
tt3724898,"Total waste of time.
Dont watch even if you are throughly bored."
tt3724898,This started off so well with an interesting premise. This film was confused and lost it's way. Some good FX and a reasonable cast was let down by a poor story.
tt3724898,"A complete waste of my time movie due to bad acting, a very all over the place convoluted plot & narrative, horrible direction, abysmal screenplay, below average cinematography, atrocious editing & pacing, non-existent character development, and a bland at best score. The only redeemable quality of this movie is the gore, but unfortunately it can't save the movie from being so extremely incoherent & a slob to get through. It also does admittedly have a few interesting ideas, maybe if the writing and direction weren't so terrible, these ideas could really shine in a much better movie. Stay the hell away from this movie and just stick with say the Jumanji movies."
tt4867110,"I don't even know where to start. The acting was poor, there were sound issues on the movie, I don't think I've ever watched a movie where that happened (you can hear ambient noise sometimes, weird music, people that are talking on corridor sound louder like if they were speaking directly to you). Most characters acting was really bad, they introduce new people, like family members all the time. There scenes that doesn't make any sense, they just add extra minutes to the film. Many plot holes and continuity issues too. It could have been a funny movie based on the app idea, but they make it painful to watch instead."
tt4867110,"This movie has some of the poorest acting I have ever seen. Even the filming of the actors suck. This movie reminds me of something you did for a school project, but didn't really want to. I only lasted about 20 minutes of watching. Don't waste your time."
tt4867110,"I really don't know how can anyone rate this with more than 4 stars. I have no words to describe it. Only watched it because of Noah and it was a complete waste of time. The characters are all stereotypes, the girls are either dumb and shallow or a nerdy shy romantic, the boys are pigs. It's not even funny. Of course there's a man to teach girls about their value, feminism and all, cause how else would they learn, right? The storyline is so poor, terrible acting, useless scenes. I'm so confused, why the hell did Noah take this job? Adam Sandler's movies are oscar worthy compared to this garbage, honestly. Don't waste your time!"
tt4867110,"I made an account just to review this. This is the WORST movie I have ever seen. The cinematography was horrific. The acting was atrocious. The plot? What plot! PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS! It's not even fun to make fun of, it's just bad."
tt4867110,"I'm not even focusing on the story, the visuals alone were absolutely terrible and filled with camera op shadows, focus puller accidently turned the ring the wrong way, lighting got put behind all the runners, half the extras were staring down the lens. It looked like they filmed without knowing the aspect ratio, I'm surprised this isn't someone's college assignment. I'm surprised it didn't end with 'Shot on an iPhone
so if I were you if you swipe left on this one"
tt4867110,This doesn't even deserve a 4.1. It was so bad. I had to keep watching to see if it got better. Spoiler alert it never did.
tt4867110,"Couldn't watch the whole movie. Was it written by a 13-year-old boy who's never spoken to girls? The film production was incredibly low-budget -- and not in a good way. Really disappointed that supposedly up-and-coming actors would star in this disaster of a film, which is targeted for teens but I do NOT recommend teenagers to watch this and believe that women would or should EVER behave anywhere near how this movie depicts."
tt4867110,"I don't know why everyone's bouncing on Noah's lap for this film, his acting is totally unremarkable. Kristen Johnston stood out for me. Otherwise this seemed to be something written by people still stuck in the ""Revenge of the Nerds"" era of social dynamics. It somehow manages to be blithely misogynistic and misandrist simultaneously. I've never heard of the writer-director but she seems to be remarkably out of touch.
Clearly someone did some research into coding as this is a film that relies heavily on tech, sadly they seemed to give up shortly after learning the words ""Python, Javascript, HTML and Perl"".
Continuity errors, bad stereotypes and unrealistic dialogue galore. Don't waste your time."
tt4867110,"Childish and the visuals were terrible, utter disappointment."
tt4867110,Go back to 1 star reviews and listen to them. I warned GO BACK AND SAVE YOURSELF.
tt4867110,"Boring movie, Noah canastrão, I let it go, I don't like to leave a movie in half, even when it is totally unsalted ... The second act improved, when it portrayed the families accessing the application, and the third act trying to redeem itself and show the strength of women, it sounded fake, it didn't save the movie..."
tt4867110,"Only watched this because of Noah Centineo, and yet it is still disappointing. The story literally crashed down to trash. There is no Character development, besides James who realises stuff and that was it. WASTED my time on this movie. what a lame movie."
tt4867110,"What an absolute pile of sh
The script is dire
The acting is amateur
I actually feel bad for the cast members. They must have realised how bad this film was while filming it.I did actually watch the whole movie because I was playing on my phone for most of it.If I was going to create an app, mine would digitally destroy their movie"
tt4867110,"Possibly the worst movie I've ever watched. It portrays almost all of the female cast as dumb, slutty, shallow, crazy etc. and is overall incredibly degrading to the female cast. The acting is beyond terrible and the budget and directing the movie was given did not help it whatsoever. The only comedic parts of this movie are the many awkward silences between lines that were most likely due to bad production. The plot was not only weak but had so many holes throughout the movie that it was hard to follow what was going on. The movie constantly jumps around in order to somehow shove along the plot and almost 'get it over with'. There was one scene where with no context or explanation whatsoever the main actors come on in sandwich costumes and a grim reaper costume. There was no previous mention of the holiday or even after to give you the reason of the costumes leaving you to just infer it was halloween or something. I couldn't believe that 1.) Noah Centineo was apart of this low-budget, badly directed, and overall garbage of a movie 2.) That it was produced by Netflix. I've seen some slightly bad things by Netflix, but this?! This was like it was written by 12 year olds and produced by a 3rd grade class. Don't waste your time."
tt4867110,"I watched this movie only because Noah C was in. However, it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The movie is extremely low budget and has a poor story. I can only imagine a person with 10-year-old intelligence could have written something like this.I don't recommend this movie to anyone. Don't be fooled by a few known actors in cast."
tt4867110,Do yourself a favor and watch traffic pass by rather than watch this garbage.
tt4867110,"Really sucks, nothing holds this movie together. cast is horrible, cringiest storyline. my friend fell asleep while watching it, genuinely the worst movie i have ever watched and i have seen some shockers!"
tt4867110,I have never even left a film review but this film was so bad I had to contribute. I genuinely kept watching just to see if it could get worse and more offensive and it just kept delivering. Honestly how did this get made?
tt4867110,I could've made a better movie and I have 0 experience....
tt4867110,"Every single aspect of ""Swiped"" is perfection. As someone who discovered 352 flaws in Citizen Kane, 2,443 flaws in The Godfather, and 140 flaws in Spirited Away, I could not find a single flaw in Swiped.Ann Fishman directed the movie beautifully. I was so stunned by the immaculate direction that I vomited on myself; however, Swiped continued to entrance me, that I did not bother to pause the movie and clean up.Kendall Sanders gave the best performance to any movie ever. A veteran screaming during a PTSD episode looks like child's play compared to the entire Cast- Sanders in particular. The delivery on phrases like ""You are the app"" will be studied for generations.In all seriousness, Swiped is truly awful. There is only one redeemable aspect: its unintentional hilarity. My friends and I have watched Swiped multiple times, and there is always a new dumb aspect to pick up on. Whether it's George Hamilton explaining to Sanders about his sex life for no reason, or Sanders ordering 6,000 GRAMS of Vitamin C, the film has endless aspects of hilarity.Instead of going into Swiped expecting something good, gather your friends-lots of friends-and laugh your asses off at the pure incompetence displayed on the screen. With the wrong mindset, you conclude that this is the worst movie ever made. With the right mindset, you still conclude that is the worst movie ever made, but the most enjoyable experience you've had in years."
tt4867110,I didn't know what to expect when watching this but it was super funny. The director did a great job with the cast selection and the storyline is relevant in todays social world. A nice message in the end.
tt4867110,"The movie sucks, it's the worst acting I've ever seen"
tt11385066,"It sucks in every way, boring actors, screenplay, plot.. terrible mix of a melancholy soundtrack that contrasts the screenplay in various scenes.. A ghastly experience."
tt11385066,"The movie start from nothing and end to nothing. i have finished it and until now i don't know what the director want to say.!!
character like ""ofelia"" i don't know why she is exist in the movie and what it denotes to. lack of creativity and choose the easiest way in everything."
tt11385066,"It's useful just if you are learning Italian and you need to practice. The end is weird.
Another Italian movie available in Netflix is ""18 Regali"" (18 Regalos, 18 Presents) Much better but it reminds me of Mama by Penelope Cruz."
tt11385066,"I kept watching because it's so bad. The story is all over the place. It feels like a 3hr movie and it's just over an hour. If you want to know how not to make a film, or write it, watch this. How do things like this even get made? Who's the person that convinces producers that this is something solid?"
tt11385066,When you think it can't get worse he can win the challenge. It looks terrible. The worst movie I've seen in the last 10 years.
tt11385066,"Im not sure i can think of a single positive for this movie. The story juts from pointless scene to pointless scene, without any link to the prior or the next. It feels like a school project"
tt11385066,Nobody should be punished with watching this movie! There's not even one good point in this movie! Pure trash! The bad one!
tt11385066,"You spend your whole time trying to work out a plot that reveals itself to be non existent, the trailer makes it look like a movie about a guy cheating on his girlfriend on a dating app but this was very misleading in my opinion. And the hotel workers role was just confusing, what was the purpose of her behaviour? Puzzling film with a reveal of emptyness"
tt11385066,"Literally the worst movie I've ever seen. I can't even tell what the movie is about, it's that weird."
tt11385066,"Whatever you read this is just a really boring flick with long sequences of people walking, making phone calls and having wooden conversations. Even the dubbing was uneven. Just awful"
tt11385066,"The app deserves the highest score that can be given. Love is one of the few needs that a person must hold in order to survive and so it doesn't matter who makes that feeling felt. Nicolo's soul, who seemed to have had everything he needed, gained peace when he met Maria and continued to communicate with her. He is ready to sacrifice everything to continue experiencing this spell. Could there be a more realistic scenario than this? There was a magnificent view of Italy. Besides the app with its whole details that touched the heart of man was simply an enchanting masterpiece. I couldn't make sense of getting a low score and I believe that the only reason for this is people's cash provisions. I sincerely recommend the movie, which I watched multiple times and discovered a brand new beauty every time I watched it. Let yourself free..."
tt11385066,"There's no story whatsoever. Watched till the end though, thought that they could come up with something eventually - spoiler alert - no!"
tt11385066,"Nothing made sense, abrupt out of the blue conversation without any depth and stereotypical phrases just filling the time.also animal abuse, that pure snake :'("
tt11385066,"Unattractive actors... a weak, snivelling protagonist... and an exercise in narcissism. Unconvincing wooden delivery and a plot that possibly got lost in the mail? This movie makes me want to take up LSD to see if it makes more sense on psychedelic drugs."
tt11385066,"Slow, boring and fade. Lacks depth, plot and doesn't make much sense."
tt11385066,"The guy held the snake so tight he was about to break it. Made me so angry to watch! All for a movie scene!? Poor snake, absolutely disgusted. Not great acting either."
tt11385066,"Other than to bore me silly and put me into a deep dreamless slumber. If so, it was a success. If not, a total bust."
tt11385066,"It's 78 minutes of dull, incoherent scenes and wooden acting. Nothing made sense, no character development, no plot, no nothing. It's shot in the beautiful city of Rome but even that didn't add any value to the movie. Probably only good thing about this film is that it forced me to make an IMDB account just so I can rate it. It's that bad."
tt11385066,"There are movies that are so poorly made that that they can be quite amusing. This is NOT one of them. This one is just bad! It's so bad that it doesn't even deserve a
Golden Raspberry. And this is not just an opinion of guy that watches action movies only. My gf was the first one who said that she urgently needs to puke after the movie ended. I am not spending any more time into writing this review because the movie just doesn't deserve it. Don't waste your time. You'll have more thrills if you watch Forest Gump for the 20th time. END."
tt11385066,"I mean, there are bad movies, but even in bad movies there are some interesting moments, but this one is another level of bad. Movie is so stupid and pointless that you can't even describe it with words. There should be a law where you get reimbursed for wasting time on movies like this one. Officially, the worst movie I ever saw!"
tt11385066,"Awful movie and I watched it in Italian. Awful acting, just over boring and stupid. The protagonist is a terrible actor and has a very strange face, which was filmed at times very close and made it look even weirder.
Avoid like the plague"
tt11385066,"I went into the movie thinking it was going to be good but I was wrong. The storyline jumps all over the place, the actors aren't very good, and the plot could have been conveyed in a better sense. I thought the movie would be a bit humourous and uplifting but I found that it was dreary all the way through. Entertaining to say the least but not good."
tt11385066,The worst movie I have ever watched. Nobody should watch it. No sense.
tt11385066,Havent watched a bullsh.t movie like this for a long time. What a waste of time for everyone. Cant believe netflix.
tt11802938,This movie is very funny.I literally laughed from thr begining to the end.
tt9624766,"From the dialogue to the fight choreography, I can't believe they make movies this bad these days, especially with what should be a pretty decent cast. Watch it for comedy value if you're bored enough."
tt9624766,"A comet falls from space. In Burma, Jake Barnes is running from flying weapons from an unseen enemy. He falls off a cliff into the ocean. He is rescued by fishermen and brought to the western military but there is bad translation. He's suffering from amnesia. He is a part of a group of Jiu Jitsu fighters battling an alien creature for 2000 years with the fate of the world in the balance.This is a sci-fi B-movie. The story feels like a high school writing assignment. There are a few real actors here. They are of varying qualities. They have Nicolas Cage. It's obvious that most of the expertise lies in the fight choreography. It's Tony Jaa and Frank Grillo and all the stuntmen they can fit. Oh year, they have a Predator slash Halloween costume bad guy and it's an alien. This is bad with good fights that get repetitive. It's bad but not so bad that it's good."
tt9624766,"I often like to watch trash/bad movies for fun, but man... I had literally no idea what was happening during 90% of this movie.I won't take too long here, but almost everything is bad, the story doesn't make sense... the alien has a fetish on fighting humans? The acting is bad, and well, they sell you on a classic Nic Cage bad movie, but he's barely in the movie.Pretty awful. I will give them some credit tho, cause they try to use some different camera styles on the fighting scenes, and well, in some of them the choreography isn't horrible, still, there are so many of them you easily get tired of watching.To sum up, a bad bad movie, there isn't much here that's worth giving a shot."
tt9624766,"For me this movie was like a train wreck, even though it's terrible you just can't look away! Watching this was an internal battle for me. The greatest fight sequence in this film will not be on the actual screen, but will be fought internally. Between your higher self wanting to stop wasting your own time, and your lower self wanting to laugh and see if it could possibly get any worse!Nicholas Cage I love many of your films. But this, like quite a few of the unfortunate choices of movies you've been in, I have to ask, what were you thinking? I guess money is money? Lol, of course, it's easy for me to be making comments from the sidelines I suppose, so what do I know? But oof! This was so bad! But heck, it was fun to have a few drinks and make fun of this! So, I give it 5 stars for entertainment quality! Lol"
tt9624766,"This movie is so bad. It's no even one of those movies that is so bad it's funny...its just rubbish. I watched it to the end to see if it would get better, but it doesn't."
tt9624766,"This movie is laughably bad in every way possible... end of review?Eh. I'll say some more. I could tell it was poor filmmaking almost immediately. Bad everything (acting, dialogue, music, and cartoon cgi). The movie makes zero sense. There are a thousand dumb moments or things to make fun of.But i figured, if it has good fighting, i could enjoy it. And i saw tony jaa in the opening credits so i thought we might get that.What do i even say. The fight scenes were TERRIBLE. And it's very odd that it's not because of the usually suspects: quick cuts, shaky cam and close up shots. In most of the fights, none of that was present. And in many, there were extremely long takes with wide shots.So why were they so bad? I'm not really sure. One of the best compliments i can say about fight scenes is that i could feel every hit, like with john wick and the accountant. This movie was the exact opposite, i couldn't feel the hits at all. And i don't know why.Maybe it has to do with sound mixing. There was almost no noise with the hits, and sometimes the noise seemed off by a half second. Could also be that they didn't focus on the moment of the hit. I can't figure it out.But what i do know is, the fight scenes gave me zero pleasure. Combine that with every other movie attribute being terrible and this is just a straight-garbage movie. Damn you nick cage!... i wonder what movie of his i'll watch next (1 viewing, 5/7/2021)"
tt9624766,"This is the worst film I've ever seen in my life. The special affects were abysmal, the acting was awful, I don't even think they did any Jiu Jitsu either."
tt9624766,With all the high caliber flicks Cage has been flooding the market with lately I was chomping at the bit for this one... and boy did it not disappoint. It was so bad even Zeus's butthole was shocked into submission. You deserve to get arm barred for this turd Nicolas... wow. Matter of fact you would get more enjoyment out of watching a stray dog drop a deuce than sit through this again...
tt9624766,"This movie is just so bad..
You'd think there would be some jiu jitsu in a movie that's called Jiu jitsu.. But no..
Nicolas Cage + the lack of jiu jitsu..
Its just horrible..."
tt9624766,"This is one of the worst movies I have yet to see. There is a lot of staged martial arts fighting and if you like that this movie may be for you. The story is really silly and the acting is really second-rate at best. Maybe its really the terrible writing or maybe its the terrible directing, I just can't make up my mind what was worse. When you start to watch this movie you're not sure if its a serious movie or a comedy. By the middle of the movie you really do not care and you can practice speed watching this movie using the fast forward key. I feel almost as bad for the actors in this movie as I do for the people that watched this movie. But at least the actors got paid."
tt9624766,The the premise was hilarious. The CGI was hilarious. Nicolas Cage's acting was hilarious. All In All you have to take this movie as completely tongue-in-cheek. I gave this movie a 7 because it was hilarious however had I taken it seriously I probably would have given it a 2.
tt9624766,"I decided to give this a go , for Nick Cage's sake, but Wow, mistake of mistakes, 20 minutes in I had to give up it's Utter dreck, so a few nights later after a few beers , I tried again!!!! Just Don't, it really is Horrible, how this junk got made I'll never know, just save yourself, and stay Far Away!!!"
tt9624766,Some people might see value in it. I really tried. All I could think was this is the unholy love child of kung fu panda and predator.
tt9624766,"Forgettable and not worth watching. Nicolas Cage looks bored and you can tell he is doing this as a cash grab, can't blame him. Ironically enough, I am sure people watched this just for Cage."
tt9624766,"If you dont care about quality, dialogue, plot, acting, fight scenes, CGI and life in general this may be the movie for you. If however you actually enjoy your life, save yourself the torture and self-inflicted harm and walk away...Seriously, I thought, it can't get any worst can it? But it does. Then it does it again. And again.Some people give it a high rating because it's so bad it's good? They lie. It's worst than that, which makes it bad again. And it's not funny. It's annoying. There's a very big difference. The tone, the seriousness with which the actors take themselves. The actors themselves and the energy they put off just made me cringe so often, like fingernails on a chalkboard.Mr. Cage lol how did it come to this?..I dont understand how rubbish like this even gets made in 2020...Oh, as a proof of the insanity of whoever put this joke out into the world, the fighting styles used are anything but jui jitsu.Ironic? Or just very sad?Definitely sad."
tt9624766,"They condensed it to 20 minutes...
Especially the beginnen is slow, with lots of unnecessary 'fake' action...
The dance like action continues throughout the movie, which makes it boring to watch at certain times...
The storyline is simply too simple or basic to carry a full length movie...
Sorry..l."
tt9624766,"Worst film ever. Only 1/10 because Nicolas Cage. I can't believe this film is real. The story is useless. The dialogues are so bad and I want my life back. Don't watch this movie. I like trash movies, but this was way to much.I don't know what else to say. I have a list with Nicolas Cage movies. And we're trying to watch all of them. So this was quiet a tough one. I hope the other ones will be more than 1/10.I have to write 170 more characters. Soooooo.... Don't watch it. It's not worth your life time. Or you are having a list like we have. So I think you'll have to watch it. Anyway... Nicolas Cage is the best."
tt9624766,"I don't regret watching this film, but this is definitely not a perfect film at all.My rating is 5 stars out of 10 because, like every film I watch, I always give them a chance to be good and see the positives.The story overall was all right. I found it to be a simple story to follow.Many reviewers criticize the main actor's lack of acting ability, but I think he should be cut some slack as he is known for performing stunts than acting.Some transitions between scenes seem awkward as they are hard jumps to the story without much detail.There was cinematography in one fight scene that was switching between first-person view and third-person view, which confused me a lot on which perspective I'm suppose to look at.The comic relief, Tex, seem a little annoying too.Without spoiling the film, there was a character whom I thought would have a larger role in the movie that just randomly died in the middle of the movie, and their character death wasn't provided with any emotional weight as if they didn't become relevant anymore & tossed out.Overall, it's best to watch the film with low expectations."
tt9624766,"Was this made by YouTubers? The cinematography was God awful. Like yeah it was a bad movie, but all martial arts focused movies (made by white people) are gonna be bad. I've watched my fair share of Steven Segal movies. I know the drill. This? This was worse. The filming made me dizzy. If you can't see the cool stunts (or can't watch them because dizzy) then what's the point?"
tt9624766,"I will grant a generous 2 stars to this...thing. First star for existing, second for getting actors.."
tt9624766,"My teenage son and I have developed a tradition of watching Nicholas Cage movies, preferably bad ones, when he's off sick from school.This movie did not disappoint.I mean it is absolutely terrible. And we could not stop laughing.The main character looks like he's recently been lobotomised and just stares moronically during everyone else's dialogue. Think Jean Claude Van-Damme if you ordered him from Wish. I thought it was a bold move to NOT cast the only recognisable name as the lead, that name being Mr Cage, but it turns out they really just are that stupid.Don't worry tho because Nicholas Cage delivers with such classic mid-fight quips as: 'That's my favourite chair, I thought you'd find it comfortable' and 'I make hats out of newspapers'...ground breaking. He does have an incredible talent of being left behind at a location by the group of warriors, only to be at the place they're arriving at later. Don't think about that too much, it will never be explained.The rest of the cast were just a group of walking stereotypes, which was just perfect! The wise, stoic Asian man who will definitely die 'honourably' at some point. The black man who is afraid of everything and cracks jokes that never land. The female warrior who you better not underestimate, she could break you like a twig sunshine. I mean you really couldn't want more in a bad movie.I'm sure there is a plot in there somewhere. I think I asked my son about 5 times 'what on earth is happening??' to be met with a reflection of my bemused face. Still now, I cant figure it out... Maybe its because it sets up a vague pretence then doesn't move forward. The 'protagonist' (if you could bring yourself to envision that) has amnesia that for some reason just doesn't improve at any point until the end. There is zero arc...zero.The CGI is something to behold. Imagine the quality of late 90's kids TV CGI. It was dreadful. My favourite part was when they revealed the alien's face. I was in tears by that point, a mixture of laughter and desperation.This movie has no redeeming features. The acting, the camerawork, the costumes, the dialogue, the plot if there is one, nothing can save this absolute masterclass in how to not make a film.And because of all this, we loved it and have been quoting it ever since. Recommend."
tt9624766,"Just watched this monstrosity out of curiosity as Nic Cage was in it. Regardless of the quality of the movie, one thing is for sure - Nicolas Cage sure is a prodigious film maker. One really has to admire the fact that he just keeps pumping out these straight to video movies as if they were Knight Rider episodes from the 80s. One after that other with clockwork regularity, he puts them out. He REALLY likes making movies. AND he puts his heart into the role, no matter how silly the movie. One HAS to admire that. And despite his advancing years, he's still got the moves. He's fitter than most men his age or even many younger stars.So, put aside your criticisms - yes this is a silly movie - it's not to be taken too seriously - A Ninja meets Predator mashup - have fun with it. Nic Cage is doing his best to entertain you and he's far better at it than Steven Segal. And as a bonus Tony Jaa is also in it! I really hope he makes a comeback into mainstream movies - I do have a soft spot for the guy. (Also Tony) Keep at it Nikky!!"
tt9624766,"Gave it 30 minutes, made me laugh out loud. Then I switched it off. Nicolas Cage, what happened bro?!"
tt1415252,"What the Hell Ram Gopal Varma is thinking about the Viewers? I did watch the movie, i am upset at the end just because every viewer expects the story to uncover/disclose during the climax scenes.This GREAT Indian Director is suggesting us to watch the next sequel to find the actual story of the Movie. This is making the viewers as fools. This isn't fare in any regard.One more thing to say .. I hope he copied many a scenes from the Telugu movie ""Anumanaspadham"". If in the next sequel he depicts ""SETU"" as the one who do all this MURDER - STUFF, then i will give it (Agyaat 2) a 2/10 (somehow i am giving 4/10 to Agyaat 1).Surely, I am not waiting for the sequel. (i am confident, he will ruin the viewers feelings)"
tt1415252,"Irrespective of the fact that his last few films haven't really been great experiences, one still enters a Ram Gopal Varma movie with certain expectations in mind.But Ramu nowadays it seems is hell bent on scaring even his most loyal fans away. Agyaat turns out to be one such experience wherein you go in expecting a thrill ride but come out absolutely unmoved rather irritated.Agyaat tells the story of a film crew arriving in a dense forest to shoot their film. The team comprises of a tantrum throwing hero Sharman (Gautam), the heroine he badly lusts for – Aasha (Kothari), a South Indian producer Moorty (Ishrat Ali), an eccentric director JJ (Howard), a submissive spot boy Laxman (Ishtiyak Khan), the philosophical cameraman Shakky (Kali Prasad), a forever frustrated action director Rakka (Kale), Assistant Director Sujal (Nitin) and the simple script supervisor girl Sameera (Rasika Duggal) who has a secret crush on Sujal.While Sameera pines for Sujal, he dreams of attaining the film's leading lady Aasha. Circumstances lead to a two day shoot break. Setu (Joy) the local jungle guide then suggests a small camping trip in the jungle. During night when everyone is enjoying the bonfire, following a strange sound Setu goes on to find out more about it but doesn't return. When the crew members go on to find him they find his dead body. Petrified, they all try to run out the jungle but their car meets with an accident.Now trapped in the unknown terrain as they try to find their way out more crew members start dying under mysterious circumstances. With hardly any known faces amongst his cast members, Ramu manages to hold your attention to some extent by his gimmicky shot taking and effective use of background music.Agreed in a thriller with a short running time of under two hours there is less time for character development but what about the screenplay Sir? Also, the placing of the annoying item song in the opening credit titles serves no purpose. Most of the actors too are a huge let down in the sense that they simply end up grating on your nerves and in fact you feel relieved that they have been bumped off.Agyaat through its promos and Ramu's interviews appeared to be his ode to films like Predator, Blair Witch Project etc but in reality it appears an insult to them.At the end by literally keeping the mysterious killer ""Agyaat' (unknown) he seems to have already made a preparation for a sequel.Telugu star Nitin Reddy making his Bollywood debut is earnest. Priyanka Kothari shows a bit of improvement in her acting. Gautam Rode fits the part. Amongst the rest cast, none really impress.Agyaat is a disappointment. Enter this jungle at your own risk. Then don't complain we didn't warn you."
tt1415252,"Being an avid RGV fan I make it a point to cover every body of work he is involved with and needless to say I had a mission to accomplish when Agyaat was released. Does it work? Well, read on.... I promise I will keep it short-n-simple (hopefully!). The performances of every actor is amazing, background score deserves applause, cinematography is breath-taking, the jungles are captured at its natural best. Sadly behind all this foam - there is no beer! For every scene seems disjoint resulting in inability to connect connect with the storyline and therefore the fear. For instance when the actors were scared I was feeling ""much-ado-about-nothing"". Same with background score. As for the movements of Agyaat it is copied from Screamers and the blink-and-miss from Predator. ۩ Gautam Rode (Sharman): Was loud and OTT. And which actor are you digging at RGV?۩ Priyanka Kothari (Aasha): Cauliflow is a cauliflower by any other name (pardon the expression Shakespeare!). She is not another Urmila - lightening doesn't strike twice at the same place.۩ Ishteyak Khan (Laxman): Releasing pent-up energy was kind of coming.۩ Ravi Kale (Rakka): Agyaat was a window to show-case his muskles to which the audience were Agyaat about.۩ Howard Rosemeyer (JJ): Parents and teachers should be blamed for his awful habit of chewing pencils.Exploring jungles is not a new terrain to RGV. He has done a brilliant job in Kshana-Kshanam, Antham, Jungle and Nishabd. This time around I got bored with the forest, monkeys and the weird camera angles. Wonder what this itch of the spider who refuses to give up with the horror genre. Agyaat 2 - can the thought ""Rest In Peace"", please? PS: We can expect RGV to pull up his socks for his next outing, hopefully!"
tt1415252,"Ram Gopal Verma returns with a new spooky venture minus any publicity gimmick as used in his last movie ""Phoonk"". But the expectation level from an RGV film, still remains high as usual, with his fans waiting for something new, each time he returns to the screen. However, after his last few movies, RGV fans are now divided into two sections. One, who are the die-hard fans and would watch his movies irrespective of the content or subject. And second, who love RGV but still don't go for his new release at once and prefer waiting for the general response. ""Agyaat"" will be a disappointment to both these sections as the original Ram Gopal Verma is completely missing from the scene, this time.The movie can be reviewed in just a few lines as it gives you nothing much to write about in details. First of all it is neither a scary horror movie nor a fast paced exciting thriller as shown in its publicity campaigns. It only revolves around an idea of merciless killings made by an unidentified power, roaming in the forests. The victims are the people of a film unit, shooting on location in the dense forest, led by a local villager, who knows the area in details. Now how they all meet with their deadly ends is the only theme for this new disappointing venture from Ram Gopal Verma.""Agyaat"" straight away starts off with a song, which was really surprising coming from the master film-maker. And then it tests your patience till the next 60 minutes since nothing happens on the screen as expected. It picks up in the second half but by then you already know what is going to happen till the end. Throughout the movie, you keep on feeling that there is something strange going on, not at par with the style and standards of the brand, Ram Gopal Verma. RGV only seems to be there in the experimental climax, where once again he surprises with a bizarre kind of ending, used so daringly. The climax makes you wonder, the level of confidence this man has, who doesn't even care about the success or failure of his projects.The acting department has only one name you will remember after going through this so called horror thriller, and that is Priyanka Kothari. She shows great improvement with her controlled performance and sensual looks. But rest all, are just fine in their routine kind of roles having nothing great in store for any particular character.The movie hugely depends upon the Sound Effects, Background score and Cinematography. But in my opinion it's high time we have to move ahead from only relying upon the Sound Design and Camera-work in a horror or thriller film. Along with these essential ingredients, the story and content also has to be looked upon as a major contributor in this genre. Sadly, the latest offering from ""The Maestro"" scores the minimum in this department and has only got the virgin locations showcasing the beautiful Sri Lankan forest as its best part.In few words ""Agyaat"" is just another project from the RGV factory which even raises doubts on being directed by the Master himself. May be he looked after the project as the caretaker and only gave his inputs towards the climax. Anyway, Ram Gopal Verma once again disappoints in a big way and wastes our hard earned money and time. The low cost of the project may rope in some returns but RGV desperately needs to reinvent himself for the sake of all his fans."
tt1415252,The film tried to be good and it was a bit different from your average Indian film. The concept of invisible unknown creature (Predator) hunting the crew one by one is very good on paper. I don't know if it was budget issue or something with the direction or just the cliches that they tried to put in it but the film didn't come out very good.
tt1415252,A C-grade inspiration of termorse. A low budget movie with unnecessary suspense mystery and drama. Wasting your time on this movie is not recommended.
tt1415252,Ram Gopal Verma is again with a horror flick.Sorry I missed the earlier ones. But this one is really nice. For some obvious reasons I didn't like the movie. Which are the Item songs and much of a Sex...Else the movie is really good. The way the camera zooms is fantastic. The sound is very realistic.All the characters a have done a very good job.The locations are really exotic. I really wish I was there.Now wait for the AGYAAT 2Don't Miss it.
tt1415252,"I can usually stomach anything, and like even so-bad-its-good movies, but this was actually painful to watch. There's so many things wrong about this movie that it's tough to know where to start. Nothing happens for the first half of the movie except for some obnoxious characters either trying to be funny, or trying to be obnoxious. Awful camera shots...and when something finally does happen, we have to endure 10 character reaction shots. The visual effects are awful and the auditory effects are insanely hilarious...kind of like Curly of the Three Stooges in the jungle...what were they thinking ? And what is it about Bali movies and the singing at the most inappropriate times ? I gave it two stars for the simple fact that I liked the interactions in the beginning between the main protagonist and his assistant who was in love with him, and I've seen worse. But, I have never used this word in reviewing movies before... AVOID."
tt1415252,"Next to no scares, annoyingly obnoxious characters, and just plain weird.. I'm being generous by giving this a 4"
tt1415252,"Hats off to RGV. EXCELLENT movie.
Something extremely different then stupid Bollywood same story movies.Waiting for part 2."
tt1415252,"RGV's AGYAAT of 2009 is still UNMATCHED in excellence till date!Superb location, spine chilling moments and wonderful though very scary locations , makes up for this one in couple of decades SLICK and Fast Paced Movie, with No Nonsense!The reviewers who are giving a negative publicity for this movie, should grab a producer and direct a movie which'll be a proof that they ACTUALLY KNOW THE ART OF FILM MAKING! HA HA, THEY'LL MAKE.a Movie which will at best will be a BEST TO BE FORGOTTEN DISASTER.."
tt3283708,"Bad dubbing, bad acting, bad photography, bad lighting, bad dialogue, and I'm only twenty minutes in. Looks like amateur actors didn't feel sure of themselves or the plot, which had a few holes. Police procedures, medical involvement and journalistic work stepped on each other's toes, and the cod portrayal of an ""alternative personality"" just grated. It looked like someone watched ""Dexter"" and thought they could do better. They didn't."
tt3283708,"The Plot. An investigative Journalist thinks she's found a killer, and breaks into his place to find the evidence. Only when he come's back it becomes a game of cat and mouse with deadly consequences.As of this writing there is only one other review -- from someone who worked on the movie and give it an extraordinarily good review.It's not a good movie.It's very cheaply made and not especially well done. I mean if you are in college and you made this movie, OK, but it's just not professional.Plus it's slow as molasses. And nothing about it is suspenseful.Move on."
tt3283708,"The movie was all but urban, very low quality and clearly made on low budget. Everything seemed to just happen so quickly yet so slowly (get what I mean?). It had an unusually dull mood and was quite predictable at times.The 'horrific' moments seemed rather unconvincing and quite childish. Very simplistic. It doesn't get the viewer to fully understand and (perhaps) sympathize with the killer's actions. It wasn't all bad though. In fact, overall the ideas were pretty good. I especially saw the ending quite interesting but still felt like it was one of those endings in which the director of the movie feels he/she failed viewers throughout the movie and decides to make up for it in the end.It had a great environment and gave a feel of the regular neighborhood in England. However, ask me how I found this movie on a usual day, and the quickest answer I'd give you would probably come with the 'S' word."
tt3283708,"I am a Brit watching a British Movie.Ok...so imagine some college students who have been given a week to put a film together as part of their A Level drama. They get hold of a cheap camera which is sort of an upgrade from a standard video camera but have to use their phones for most of it. They don't have an editor so one of them talks their younger brother into ""Giving it a shot"", in exchange for being allowed to borrow their PS5.Then they need a cast. No one is available so they have to do it themselves. There is an issue as they need adults too so they talk the head to physics which is close to retirement but is happy to ""Give it a bash"".They realize that their acting skills have reached the level of a semi interested but half asleep sloth as they have wasted most of the year going to raves but it's all they have so they go for it anyway.Ok, so they are ready to go but by the time they have organized all this, they only have 2 days left to make the film. Everyone has lost interest, including the brother who takes 30 minutes to edit as he is now fully engaged with the new PS5 game. Using some free download to edit, he quickly knocks it together.And there you have it......Simon.... Enjoy."
tt3283708,"The acting in this film is cringey, the storyline boring, there is no tension and the camera work is shockingly bad.It's as though someone was allowed to submit their gcse coursework to Netflix. Avoid."
tt3283708,"Ok, so it might seem a bit harsh giving this 1 star, especially as I'm British watching a Brit movie, but I feel obliged to help people avoid wasting their life watching this. I'll start with the good points. The actual sorry line as written in the initial Netflix bio make it sound watchable. Now for the not so good. The acting is pretty poor, and I'm being as nice as possible here. The direction is abysmal, the camera angles and closeness to the actors is worse than shocking, and finally the sound is so in and out, did the sound guy have matchstick arms and could not cope with the weight of the boom mic ? Trust me, this is one to avoid. I'll try and finish on a positive note though, if they'd used decent actors, and decent director, with decent equipment, it might have been ok ish."
tt3283708,"This film could've been a lot better. If the acting was a little better. Not all of it was though. The actors playing simon and sarah were not to bad and were passable, same could not be said for everybody else. I dont like the fact a sequal is to made but if its better than this ill still watch it. There were also many cuts in weird places that made the transitions between scenes bad."
tt3283708,Bad acting. Picture and sound issues. Probably because of the low budget. Plot wasn't bad though. Watchable. I didn't stop half the way. Didn;t seem that I spended one and a half hour for nothing.
tt3283708,"I've seen better acting at a primary school nativity play !Sadly not an unfamiliar storyline!Not sure if the director was awol during filming but to to say this movie is utter rubbish is the best compliment I can think.of !The actor who played Simon, was by far the worst of a very bad bunch !The continuity wasn't brilliant in a couple of places.All in all, what could have been good entertainment was totally destroyed by a tired story line, abysmal acting and an unpolished finish.It was spiced up a tad by showing breasts but it made a cheap porn movie look like a block buster. Don't waste your time watching this, you will be disappointed!"
tt3283708,"Enough with the negative reviews. Why can't people be positive about hard work that goes into low budget filmmaking with hardly any resources? Chris Bell does an amazing performance as serial killer Simon West, and the rest of the cast was good too. I guess the main female lead wasn't perfect but again, what can you do?"
tt3283708,"Simon is a very good serial killer physiological thriller starring wasted talent Chris Bell, delivering a cold and menacing performance as the titular leading character. It may look like a low budget film and it's been ridiculed for its flaws like camera, sound, acting but all-in-all I really enjoyed this movie. Just wished it had more backing so it was more worthy to be put up on Netflix but story wise wasn't bad to say the least. Warren Badenski straps everything on with this production and really gives it his all with this crime cat and mouse chase drama and I would be happy to watch this again."
tt3283708,"This film is just awful. The acting is dreadful, the script is laughably predicable, as is the storyline and the direction is appalling. You do not need to watch this film, find something else. How did this even get on to Netflix?So, is this the worst film on Netflix? Yes. Yes it is. Yes it very much is. Hands down. By a long way. Definitely yes."
tt3283708,I watched it right to the end 😭 Please don't waste any time on this. Netflix owes me 85 minutes of my life back.If it is a teenagers school project it is a good effort but I'm paying for some decent viewing and Netflix is taking the absolute piss.
tt3283708,"Warren Badenski, writer and director should find another job as should the cast. The sister/twin of one victim is incredibly ugly and on seeing her I completely lost interest. I know you have to start somewhere but what can you do with a budget of 20K? Not a lot and not a lot was done."
tt3283708,"For a low budget film it could have been better, very amateurish, the camera is horrible, the effects are horrible... the only thing I didn't find horrible was the cast. It's a film that imitates Dexter, except the killer isn't a police officer. It's terrible! I didn't spend 1 hour watching the film because halfway through I went to see the comments and ratings and apparently we all thought the same. It's not suitable for Netflix, nor did I ever think they would let these kind of mediocre films go to a platform like Netflix. I do not recommend.It's better to watch the 8 seasons of Dexter. You want to see something done right, watch Dexter."
tt3283708,"Bad storyline
Bad script
Bad direction
Bad acting
Bad camera work
After 45 mins into the film, couldn't watch it any longer. Really stupid stuff. Don't waste your time."
tt3283708,"What we have here is a piece of British filming that excels purely by the edgy fast paced driven editing and great scripting, the overall picture has that edge of the seat feeling where you are led to believe that the predator will in fact get his prey no matter what and that's the beauty of SIMON as anything could happen as it is quite unpredictable.I am sick of everyday cliché riddled star studded Hollywood thrillers that only leave you empty. This film although obviously not a block buster it still carries a feeling of dread that some thrillers of its elk does not have. This film at least draws you in and is interesting enough to keep you till the end. Plus the acting of the main character was good enough to make you feel he is so unhinged even when he is acting normal.It's rural, gritty and made with passion and that's what I like about it. All thrillers like this work because of its shall we say close to home direction and that's how the very first Texas Chainsaw worked purely because of its rawness.I like this film very much and recommend it to those who appreciate urban filming."
tt3283708,"Chris Bell plays a fantastic serial killer and knocks this one out of the park with his portrayal as the cunning and dangerous Simon. It's intense, disturbing and has twists and turns that would shake the narrative upside down. The supporting cast was a little weak but to be honest it's worth a watch. Especially if it's on Netflix. Steven M Smith is a producer on this film I think. That's always good to see before you watch all this. The Game of Thrones chick was a cool looking character but just wasn't played very well. I'm going to show my friends this. As a Chris Bell fan I really ever so much enjoyed this."
tt3283708,"Simon is a film that revolves around an investigative Journalist who thinks she's found a serial killer, and breaks into his place to find the evidence. Only when he come's back it becomes a game of cat and mouse with deadly consequences.Simon is a zero budget movie that you can't judge by it's cover. Look past the amateur cinematography and audio the film has an interesting plot-line and is backed up with convincing performances in part that help to drive the story and keep you watching. The story is simple, the premise is smooth flowing but it's the subtle approach to the script that gives it a defined edge. Nothing is rushed or forced and everything has a very natural flowing progression to it until the end where the film almost drops off and ends too suddenly in my opinion.Chris Bell puts in a scarily convincing performance as serial killer Simon, he has a sinister look to him throughout, always contrasting between this false portrayal of the good guy, a thin veil that hides his true personality. Quite a captivating performance that is dampened only by the constricting budget of the film.If you have an afternoon free, there are better movies to watch than this one right here, but if you want to appreciate the dedication of no-budget film makers and admire a good story then you can't go far wrong with Simon."
tt2186731,"I was so not interested in watching this movie, but here I was for I wanted to see how bad it could be. Two and half hours of comedy and torture, together! RGV has gone nuts!!Overall, a disappointing film. Ram Gopal Varma has definitely got the talent, no doubt about that. But he seems to ditch it and tries to make some dumb-ass films at times. Department just happens to be one of those films. Can the real RGV please stand up??Acting: 5/10 Story-Screenplay-Direction: 4/10 Technical Aspects: 5/10 Is it worth your time and money??: I so wanna say yes for I want you to go through what I went through. But I'll be nice and request you to stay away from Department. RGV has gone bonkers, and so will you if you do go watch it. Stay away!!For a detailed review, please visit sasikanth.me :)"
tt2186731,"Department directed by Ram Gopal Varma is a lazy,stupid film.Shot with Canon EOS 5D,Ram Gopal Varma takes such bizarre camera shots,that one will faint or be hospitalized for sure!Right from inside tea-cups to being flung across the beach as a ball to labyrinths of nostrils to steering of the car.Phew! The movie had great trailers.The posters were hard-hitting and brutal.But the movie turns out to be such a tomfoolery that you feel even a 4-5 year child playing the police-thief game is much entertaining.The saving grace of the movie is the performances.Amitabh Bachchan is marvelous as Sarjeao Gaekwad.Although having minimal screen space,he rocks!Rana Daggubati as Shiv Narayan is another actor to watch out.Although he has to work on his Hindi diction a bit more,he still provides a good performance.Sanjay Dutt as Mahadev Bhonsle is half-baked.His character starts off well but as the movie progresses he himself looks disinterested.Talents like Vijay Raaz and Abhimanyu Singh are purely wasted.Anjana Sukhani,Lakshmi Manchu are fine.Newbie Madhu Shalini is funny rather than deadly.Story: A suspended cop Shiv Narayan (Rana Daggubati) joins hands with inspector Mahadev Bhonsle (Sanjay Dutt) to free the city from underworld.Another reason why I liked this movie is for its climax.When Rana bashes Sanjay Dutt its such pure fun to see Dutt's paunch moving in slow-motion.The direction is highly poor.The story,screenplay,music,dialogs are bad.All in all,Department is a film of wasted talent,wasted opportunity,waste of time and waste of money.I am giving it a one on ten(Solely for the performances)."
tt2186731,"This is the worst movie ever made in Indian film history. It is an amalgam of awful screenplay,horrible direction and poor action action. Nothing is even close to good.It is better not to watch the movie. I do not know why Ram Gopal Varma keep making lousy movies. I went to the movie not expecting much fun but to just pass the time . But the movie is so bad that i came back with a headache.If you want to make a good movie, focus on the story, on speeches, on the intellect, on actual acting instead of crappy action I can see for free on a TV series My rating for this movie is 0.P.S. I think the people who rate this film more than a 5 either haven't watched the other Underworld films, were paid-off, or are insane. It just doesn't deserve anything more than a pass."
tt2186731,"I can not write a review on the whole movie, since it was so pathetic that I cant watch it for more than half and hour. The worse thing were the camera angles, it seems like if a kid have never handled the camera before is shooting the movie for the fun. It would have been a complete torture if I had to watch the whole movie. I am big fan of Amitabh B. and Sanjay Dutt but this movie was unbearable! This movie is: Pathetic and Crap. Ram gopal Verma have some real guts to repeat it again after the so called'' Ramu ki Aag' and Amitabh should be given an equal credit for signing this. By far the This is the worst movie ever made in Indian film history. Stay away!!!"
tt2186731,"It is hard to believe that this films comes from Ram Gopal Verma who has previously directed great films like Satya, Shiva and Rangeela. In this film he even managed to be get the worst ever performance from Amitab Bacchan. I have wasted nearly 3 hours of my life that I will never get back now, watching this film . Mr Ram Gopal Verma should serious think of a career change - How about starting a chain of tea stalls on bicycles.The only reason I have given it 1 rating is because IMDb won't allow any lower it actually deserves a -10. If you were to pick 10 students from your college who have never acted before I'm sure they will do a better job than the actors in this film."
tt2186731,"Wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, it's a complete waste of time. The cinematography is awful!! Scenes are shown from the most weird angles, not sure what RGV was thinking when he made this. Some were so bad I just sat there laughing thinking this can't get any worse, but it does.Feel sorry for the actors in this movie, must be hugely embarrassing for them to be a part of this. I watched about 45mins then fell asleep, mainly due to feeling sick watching the camera move from left to right, in and out. Songs aren't anything to wait for either, rubbish item song with rubbish lyrics....Don't waste 2 hours of your life on this."
tt2186731,"Truly groundbreaking film if you can tolerate the crazy camera-work. Shot with Canon EOS 5D SLR's featuring some of the oddest camera angles you will never experience from pursuing your own life. Almost turns the world upside down - even the action contains some kind of inner strength trying to escape. If absolute power corrupts absolutely then the real education of this film is the twisting nature of corruption as it rises to the top.Ignore the critical reviews - this isn't a typical Bollywood movie, except for the soundtrack. More art-house meets Matrix with an impenetrable logic. Enjoy.."
tt2186731,"This movie was way shot down by media, review websites and people in general. I agree there are few creepy/weird scenes in the movie...but the movie overall isn't a bad one if you enjoy RGV style action films. That being said, it doesn't have any repeat value but makes a decent one time watch. The performances were good and the music had typical Hollywood flavor to it. The movie camera angles of course were weird knowing RGV. Overall:pros: nice action sequences, performances, music, some creative camera anglescons: slow screenplay, no story, shoddy direction.my review 6.5/10"
tt2186731,"Department: RGV wants to do an Abbas Mastan and doles out a spoof on a combination of Phoonk, Sarkar and Company. Honestly, the film could have been named 110 Encounters - Part 1, because that is what it is, simply interspersed with some meaningless dialogues and stupid songs. It was possibly aimed to describe polarization or nexus of the police department with the government and the underworld, but beyond a point, you don't give a damn to it or the characters that splutter to life only to die in a couple of minutes. It's mindless mayhem of blood, gore and flying people on the screen. A roving camera (mostly working on close ups) gives you the feel of sting operations and made my head spin (the film gave a headache anyway). A bunch of sweaty, looney goons perched atop an unfinished building preach sermons about the wisdom and morality of the gangsters and Big B's dialogues confuse the hell out of people. What's he doing in there? Dissociate from Ramu ASAP! Sanjay Dutt is the only one to stand out while the rest of the cast is useless! Ramu's magic has faded - so STOP! I will not watch the sequel to this one, no way! Stay away!!"
tt2186731,This was the worst movie I have ever seen. Amitabh bachan and Sunay duty both are my fav actors but this movie is complete disaster.
tt2186731,Camera movement will make you giddy. Did nto expect this from ram gopal verma.
tt2186731,"Ram Gopal Varma coming up with his Rogue Methodology (using many tiny digital cameras) along with Amitabh Bachchan and Sanjay Dutt excited me a lot before the release of DEPARTMENT. But a recent interview of the director raised a strong doubt in which RGV loudly said that ""A story can fail but genuinely innovative technique can never fail."" I frankly couldn't agree to this unacceptable statement from the director which in fact was repeatedly proved wrong by his own failures in the last few years. So it was a mixed bag of expectations while entering into the theater with the doubt scoring more than the positivity.Now as the lights went off, the film right away started with an action sequence and within next 30 minutes I was sure that my doubt was once again the winner here since DEPARTMENT had nothing in it which could be associated with the brand RGV. The film never picks up in its first half and post intermission too it fails to enthrall the viewer with the same 'seen before' twists in the old tale revolving around the underworld, police and politicians nexus. Putting it straight, there is no RGV in this RGV film and DEPARTMENT can easily be included in the 5 weakest movies from the master film-maker in his entire career.Yes, it does have many fresh camera angles and shooting techniques with some amazing results on the screen. But more than 95% of the people don't go to movies for only watching their technical achievements. They are there in the theater for some thrill, for some entertainment which is not visible anywhere in this film from start to finish. It doesn't have anything new as far as its storyline is concerned. It doesn't impress you with its action sequences, confronting scenes or dialogues. And it also has some pretty bad songs thrown in regularly just unlike a RGV film. On top of that the film has a loud and annoying background score which keeps experimenting with each new sequence bringing in some new sounds. So there is no consistency in the score which eventually fails to generate any hard hitting impact on the viewer as previously seen in RGV's famous hits. And this is the same director whose film's background scores used to be the talk of the town few years back.In the performance section the film disappoints big time despite of having two big names of the industry. Sanjay Dutt is the same old cop as witnessed before. Rana Dagubati tries hard but remains emotionless throughout the film. Abhimanyu Singh overacts in his role along with Madhu Shalini and both Vijay Raaz and Deepak Tijori remain wasted. The over famous item girl Nathalia Kaur shows no promise with her weird & suggestive kind of dance performance in the minimum clothes. So the only saviors in the cast are Amitabh Bachchan and the two ladies Anjana Sukhani & Laxmi Manchu performing well in their short roles.But RGV and his DEPARTMENT together made me recall the time of late 80s & early 90s, when we all used to go to watch each and every new film of Amitabh with great enthusiasm and spirit, only to return with a lot of sadness and disappointment. In the present times, Ram Gopal Varma is now again giving us the same kind of feeling of watching all those unsuccessful films of Amitabh with every new project from his so called Factory.There was a time when movie lovers eagerly used to wait for RGVs next project and felt over-excited to see all the novel things in his path- breaking films. However now its time RGV should realize that ""It is the script which actually requires to be considered more important than the technology and the technique alone cannot result in a HIT"".May be he now admits the mistake after DEPARTMENT and returns to his good old form in his next.at least for the sake of all his die-hard fans like myself since SHIVA."
tt2186731,"RGV is loosing his touch. Movies like Aag are disgrace to his portfolio of movies. The movie is good, story is ""OK"" but the actors are promising. The camera makes you feel dizzy! Cinematography is not up to the level and the camera quality is not good. The direction overall is very casual and doesn't portray what the film actually says. I would say that such movies are based on internal topics of the country and you need more research and it should leave a social message in the end to the audience. The maturity in direction is depleting. Rana Daggubati can really act well and lives unto his role. Watch the movie because Sanjay Dutt and Amitabh Bachhan are in it not for the director. At least not this time!"
tt2310958,"Home with the flu, hopefully not Covid, I thought a nice comedy horror B-movie with a couple of gorgeous Spanish bikini girls would do the trick. The bikini girls were good but this was self indulgence at its worst. Sorry girls, somebody has to say it."
tt2310958,"I can like weird movies if they also smart, funny, scary or just have an interesting angle of some sort. Summertime offers none of these. It is not even effectively weird, it's just messy from beginning to the end.I do not understand why this movie is tagged as ""horror"", because there is none. The only relation to horror is the bikini girls referencing some horror concepts and other movies.The introduction makes no sense and creates false hope for a decent movie. The ending, after the credits, is in the same b/w style as the intro. Both are equally messy as the middle part, so the 2nd star is for consistency."
tt2310958,"It doesn't match the description in any way. It is an abysmal, student-level piece of self-indulgent drivel that thinks it's clever and meta but is really just awful.I wasted 40 minutes skimming through this. Now you don't need to waste your time."
tt2310958,"Do you like pretty girls in bikinis? It is just two of them and you may like one better than the other - but it is one of the most important questions you should ask yourself. The other important thing is: do you have problems with funny and quite meta horror? Because this is actually not a horror movie. It likes to take apart and make fun of other movies. By talking way too much - telling you that there are scary scenes - when there are none.Telling you there will be sexy scenes, when there are none. Well unless you count the bikini scenes - which are basically every scene in the movie. Again you have to take this with a grain of salt. You have to be able to laugh at jokes and maybe even know a movie or two to recognize what this is spoofing exactly.The line is quite thin to walk on and I would argue there are more misses than hits ... still it can be fun, once you fully emerged yourself into it. Also did I mention I got lost in the eyes of one of the actresses? Just me ... well there you go."
tt1576464,"Splatter, from legendary producer Roger Corman and cult director Joe Dante, stars Corey Feldman (child star of Dante's best film, Gremlins) as rock singer Jonny Splatter, who, in the opening scene, recites a voodoo chant before putting a bullet through his brain—a delightfully gory moment that lives up to the title. It's a promising start, but sadly its rapidly downhill from here.When several acquaintances of the deceased rock star gather for the reading of his will, they discover to their horror that Jonny has returned from the dead to exact revenge on those who wronged him when he was alive. Clumsily directed by the once great Dante, and featuring weak performances from a cast who are capable of much better (even Feldman), this dreadfully cheap looking and terribly uninspired effort is an embarrassment for all involved. The occasional grisly death scene does little to improve matters.Splatter was originally conceived as ten-part interactive web experiment, the outcome of each character being decided by the viewers at the end of each episode, which no doubt added a modicum of fun to proceedings; in its non-interactive form, devoid of this novelty, there is very little to get excited about."
tt1576464,"That you would ""star"" is his incoherent piece of dribble, and don't even get me started on that bizarre ending. I wasted a portion of my life watching this mess."
tt1576464,"In 2009, Netflix pitches the idea of an original interactive web series to Roger Coreman and Joe Dante. It was an early experiment in video streaming instead of Netflix shipping tons of DVDs back and forth.
The original intent was to have viewers vote on which character would die in the next 10-15 minute episode.Netflix only kept three episodes and put them together in a 29 minute short that isn't worth anyone's time.
Feldman plays a washed up rockstar who kills himself in order to bait his frienemies to his mansion so he can come back as a ghost demon and murder them.
Nothing about this film was original and the production value (even for 2009 low budget horror) is the only thing horrifying about this film."
tt1576464,"I've just watched this after Netflix recommended it to me at 92%. The effects are poor, the acting is poor and the script it awful. The one good thing about this film is it's only 29 minutes long"
tt1576464,"Splatter (2009) * 1/2 (out of 4) When you team up producer Roger Corman, writer Richard Christian Matheson and director Joe Dante you expect something much better than this short film, which, sad to say, is downright bad. Rock and roll has been Jonny Splatter (Corey Feldman) kills himself so that he can come back as a zombie-like creature and kill the five people who betrayed him in life. You have the former bandmate, the ex who stole his song, a groupie, a therapist and of course his manager who just happens to be played by Tony Todd. At just 29-minutes you'd think this would at least be somewhat viewable in a ""so bad it's good"" way but it's not. When you consider the talent involved you can't help but see this thing as a complete disaster that has very little going for it and a whole lot going wrong. You can start with the screenplay, which just throws out on cliché after another and it doesn't do a single fresh thing from start to finish. There are several references to current events or pop culture but this adds nothing. The special effects contain some decent stuff including a melting head that eventually pops as well as a throat being sliced but that's about it. As far as performances go they're really mixed. Fans of Feldman, myself included, will enjoy seeing him here even though the ""performance"" isn't the great. Todd could do this type of film in his sleep but he's always fun to watch. Erin Way was the one bright spot in the film as she played the groupie very well and certainly stole the film. I'm sure this movie wasn't meant to be taken serious and it wanted to have some sort of cult appeal but you still have to at least try and do something with it. It really seems like this movie was thrown together out of scraps and sadly the end result is very boring."
tt1576464,"From bad to worse. The film never gets any better. Singer, Johnny Splatter (Corey Feldman) starts off the movie with a bang (literally - not in a good figurative way). A comedic suicide of a self inflicted gun shot to the head. The over dramatization of blood splattering from his head leads you to believe there may be some humor to this movie.It is so ridiculous that you hope to get a laugh from it......you do not.
It's unfortunate that Tony Todd (from the ""Candyman"" and ""Final Destination"" series) cannot add any perks to this bad film."
tt1576464,"After committing suicide, a washed-up rocker returns from the grave to torment the five people who betrayed him in life.
TV-14 29m"
tt1576464,"Back in the 1950's, before commercials consumed 10 minutes of a half-hour TV show, they knew how to introduce a story, develop the plot, reach and resolve a crisis, and tidy up before rolling the credits. Splatter is not much more than the steaming pile of entrails it attempts to exploit. It even fails as at guts 'n' gore, which is about all it might have had going for it. After 30 minutes, I have to wonder why I bothered sitting through it. There must be a different Roger Corman involved in this train wreck."
tt1576464,"This Splatter is just one more failed attempt at acting for Corey Feldmen. ..he is one of the worst actors I have ever seen on TV or on VHS/DVD....how he got into acting I have no clue. His body Corey Haim. ..or however you spell his name...had no talent....may he rest in peace....COREY....GIVE IT UP! Every movie you have ever been in ...you have never added up. ...
You are surely no Brad Pitt or Hugh Jackman!....no where close. I won't be watching any more of these Feldmen netflix films....I had no idea he was in it but once I saw him I knew the movie was going to suck...and it did...got anything to say to me Feldmen...Bring it! You suck!!"
tt1576464,"This is pretty decent for a bad movie. It's not supposed to be Oscar worthy and all the low ratings suggest that's what people are looking for. You can't score every movie from the same tick sheet. Give it a watch, you might be surprised."
tt1576464,"This movie is by no means a good movie but, that being said if you watch it as a movie that a bunch of friends through together for fun one Halloween you'll enjoy it. Its not meant to win awards or even be deep. Even if thats not your style the special effects for whats obviously a shoe string budget are worth checking out."
tt1576464,"Had all the plot points to be a good film.The ONLY good thing in the whole film is seeing Tony Todd (RIP). As he's passed recently I thought I would make my way through his catalogue and had never heard of this one theres a good reason for that the film is 100 percent cheesy and terrible with only the fact Tony is in it that I was able to persevere watching.Corey's acting is abysmal.It could have been so good and just when you think it's about to turn itself around that's when it ends.If you really want to watch it set your standards low, like really LOW!The only other positive is its only half hour long."
tt1576464,This was the most awesome short movie I have ever seen! I just wish it had been longer!!
tt1576464,"This movie knows exactly what it is, i rated it higher than it maybe deserves but i think there was a lot of merit and enthusiasm put into this. i thoroughly enjoyed every short minute of it, and if you love good bad movies as i do, it's worth your half hour."
tt1576464,"1. Final destination
2. The bride of Chucky
3.splatterThis is my 3rd favourite film/show ever.I highly recommend you watch this masterpiece it's over the top acting makes this great and worthy of your time."
tt1576464,"I wasn't expecting anything from this other than a goofy and stupid film, and I wasn't disappointed. It's a silly gimmick movie but the cast and crew seem to have had a pretty good time making it and it shows.It's worth watching for the glorious Tony Todd alone, although Corey Feldman's mugging for the camera in zombie makeup was pretty entertaining as well.It's definitely a film that should be watched with an intoxicating beverage or substance nearby and absolutely not taken seriously."
tt1576464,"This movie isn't trying to be serious, and really pokes fun at what it is. It's tacky and campy (which I love), and has some real good lines. OBVIOUSLY not the kind of acting and story you'd see in a theater. Also a fun watch for 30 minutes! The opening sequence may be my favorite... ""If you want something done right, do it yourself."""
tt10738914,"Hard to say what is worse in this sequel for the hideous ""Nada a Perder"". The acting is laughable, the production values are bad even for soap operas standards and the narrative is boring."
tt10738914,"This movie comes from cult church where everybody there is robed and brainwashed , this movie is just a money grab from that crazy cult church and it's leaders, dont watch this Bad movie"
tt10738914,"The church behind this film is very powerful in Brazil. But power doesn't buy ethics. Box office numbers are manipulated, and even here their bost are trying to manipulate the score (just as happened with ""Nada a Perder 1"".With all of these, ""Nada a Perder 2"" still is a flop. The cinema's incomes are less than the half of the previous entry in this horrendous trilogy."
tt10738914,"Looks like an amateur piece, worthy of a poor drama school. As far as we know, even the box office numbers in Brazil are manipulated to increase this garbage success. Just sad."
tt10738914,"This movie comes from cult church where everybody there is robed and brainwashed , this movie is just a money grab from that crazy cult church and it's leaders, bad movie , go watch anthor movie"
tt10738914,"The film is the second part of the autobiography of Pastor Editor Macedo of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, made only to try to improve his image. It has no cinema value. Has no commitment to the reality of the facts."
tt10738914,"I am not going to talk in depth about the story of the protagonist as I do not believe he still believes in saving lives (or souls and faith).However, the production of the film is bad. The acting is deplorable and feels like a school project film. Poor editing and even the cast choice is not great either.It seems exactly like a film made the TV channel Record. They probably had a low budget, the cinema views were low and expectations flunked.Despite some of the actors being well known in the Brazilian media, they acted so poorly and there was the subpar directing that they make no difference to the film having these people in it."
tt10738914,By far one of the best movies out there! You all HAVE to watch it.
tt10738914,Nothing to lose 1 was amazing !!! I'm pretty sure the second part will be wonderful !!
tt10738914,"This is a Movie you cannot go without seeing, filled with powerful and truthful events that will just open your eyes."
tt10738914,"We watched the first part and it was very inspiring, in contrast of what others had to say, I can truly say that this movie was beyond my expectations! That was just the 1st one, imagine this second part! It is definitely a must watch, you will not regret it."
tt10738914,"I watched the first and now the second, I found it quite amazing. In contrast to a few comments, the performance of the actors were superb and the story line was rich. After watching the first, I went on to research about Edir Macedo. It was a nice experience watching it on the big screen."
tt10738914,This movie is AMAZINGGGGGGG! There are no words to describe how inspirational and how awesome it is. It's a must see
tt10738914,Great movie. Truly inspiring. When you think everything is over.... Must watch!!
tt10738914,"Truly a must watch, the message behind the real life story is very strong, and very encouraging.
You will not regret watching it!"
tt10738914,"I left the cinema inspired, certain that God is ready to do something great in me and thru me, despite the many obstacles and difficulties I might face.The movie forced me to reflect on myself, my life-story, my decisions and the impact I have had on those around me."
tt10738914,This sequel clearly shows what the power of faith can do! Never underestimate your strength. Faith turns the smallest and most insignificant people into 'giants' to confuse those considered powerful in this world. Loved watching every minute of this man's testimony that truly inspired me and greatly honors my God!!
tt10738914,"I was skeptical at first, but decided to watch because I became curious after sensing strong bias in some reviews. It's actually a very impressive story and what amazed me is that it's based on a true life story! Truly helped me think and reflect on my life to be able to believe that I can overcome too despite the many obstacles that try to stop me. I hear many people talk about faith but very few show what it's really capable of doing. This movie showed one of those few. Worth watching."
tt10738914,Last year I saw nothing to lose part 1 and it was so worth it to see it . actually opens your eyes so you can see that if you want something in life no one should stop you .Just believe in yourself and give it all you got
tt10738914,First movie was amazing. Can't wait for the second one to come out! I'm so excited to see what's going to come next. Great experience the first time I'm sure this time will be more than great!
tt10738914,It has been one ofthe greatest movie of faith that i have ever seen i recomend you to see this movie
tt10738914,"Most Inspirational Movie of the year, I saw the First film in theaters and is now available to see on Netflix ""Nothing to lose"". The first was just as great as the second, but this second film shows that when one is in trials, deserts nothing can stop you when you have Faith in God and this storm will turn to blessings."
tt10738914,The things this man was attacked with and had to overcome by himself is a true inspiration. Sometimes we go through an injustice and have no where to go but God always has our back. I recommend this if you've reached a point in your life where you feel there is no way out.
tt10738914,"Through the life of the protagonist you're able to see what faith can do, and how anyone can overcome despite their supposed limitations. Great movie."
tt10738914,The best movie I have seen this year (I bet the best movie this whole year)
tt6616074,"It's hard to tell if the totally unfunny, boring, overlong material of Amy Schumer's latest act is just an anomaly, or if talented, edgy Schumer is no more. This was awful. I really wanted to like The Leather Special. I think Amy Schumer is funny, having seen her previous stand up acts and that Bill Hader movie. She told clever jokes. The Leather Special has no jokes. I didn't laugh once. My wife didn't laugh once. Amy describes gross subjects while making gross faces. That's it. That's the whole special - or I assume it is. I quit watching with about fifteen minutes left, but I saw enough to be assured that it wasn't going to get any more funny. I'm not making fun of her weight because being heavy doesn't matter in comedy, but I think her appearance merits a mention. She wears a smallish, tight leather dress that along with a bad hairdo choice and horrible make-up creates an unflattering, swollen look that is a negative distraction. I don't think an entertainer's political views matter, so I don't hold it against them, but political comedy tends to be tedious at best. Schumer is politically active, which is her business. I appreciate that she didn't overload this act with politics - some, not much. Two out of ten if for nothing more than a star's worth of encouragement for funny Amy to come back."
tt6616074,"I enjoyed her shows before, but Schumer was neither funny nor insightful in this special. A huge swing and a miss. With the exception of the gun riff, she relied on old material focused mainly on her smelly body parts. Maybe that is why none of the big premier pay channels picked up this special. Netflix will have to do better in the future choosing streaming material."
tt6616074,"Amy Schumer: The Leather Special (2017) 1/2 (out of 4)Amy Schumer and this Netflix special has been at the center of a controversy due to its low scores. Schumer blames certain types for not liking the film and of course this led to a political battle. Was all of that really needed?I personally don't' care what political stands any celebrity wants to make and I'd never be shallow enough to bash their work just because I don't believe in their politics. With that said, THE LEATHER SPECIAL is just flat out awful. There's really no other way around it. It's nothing political but instead this is just an incredibly unfunny and extremely flat comedy special.The majority of the 57-minute running time are the same type of jokes done over and over. Of course, these jokes include Schumer talking about her vagina and various body fluids as well as various poop stories. I have nothing against that type of subject matter but it's just not funny here. In fact, I honestly only laughed two times during this special and that's just not good at all.I'm not going to judge Schumer by this one performance. I'm not sure what your typical routine is as this is the first one I've seen but I just didn't find the material to be all that funny and the delivery wasn't any better."
tt6616074,"Jaysus that was awful. I've sat through some pretty bad comedy before, on screen and in person, just to find the few nuggets of gold scattered throughout it, something to laugh along with. There was nothing here. Not a thing.Time to rethink the direction you're going in Amy, unless you want to only cater for a tiny minority of people who both agree with you and enjoy seeing these things mocked. And that number is getting smaller every year."
tt6616074,"A lot of comedians do have a recurring joke between specials that they may talk about for 5 minutes or so, but Amy Schumer does this for the entire special. Its no wonder she resorts to stealing jokes, her only original joke is that she is a gross slut (her words). Hard to give this a good rating when these are also the same jokes during her other performances.... For a person working in a creative field i see no creativity, she has given her critics so much ammo with this special.I have no more words, you will know what I mean if you watch it."
tt6616074,"She used to be funny but this ""special"" is beyond awful. I was at one point embarrassed for this young lady as it was so unfunny and at times very awkward. She has had shows that were funny but this is not one of those. If you want to watch a good comedy special SKIP this one because that is time you'll never get back!!"
tt6616074,"Amy needs to rethink her career choice of stand-up comedy and stick with material that somebody else wrote for her. This stand-up is not funny or entertaining at all. There are some female comics I really enjoy that can pull off raunchy comedy with a lot of humor. Amy was just raunchy to be raunchy and not funny at all. After watching this I felt like Ace Ventura after he found out Einhorn was a man. Had to vomit, burn the clothes I was wearing, try to plunger the show out of my head, and just sat in the shower trying to wash this show away. So bad. So awful. Doesn't even deserve 1 star."
tt6616074,"After Mostly Sex Stuff (2012) and Live At The Apollo (2015) The Leather Special is the third show I saw from stand-up-comedian Amy Schumer. Sadly it wasn't her best performance. This one was the one I didn't like very much. There were okay jokes but in general we are used to get better from Amy Schumer. That she talks alot about sex is not a problem, that's what she's known for, but it wasn't just as funny as her Live At The Apollo show. Not only her jokes were not on top, but also her story telling contained too much pausing, like she wasn't totally in there. I don't know, maybe she should turn her comedy career by coming with something completely new. I'm sure she can do that, there are other funny subjects than sex."
tt6616074,"So i have not found her funny in a long time, early on in her career she was new and funny. But as she has gotten older, I just don't get it. I like a lot of shows on Netflix but this is one of the worst. Netflix touts this as ""Amy Schumer riffs on sex, dating and the absurdities of fame"". It is not cutting edge funny just sad. As for the ""absurdities of fame"" well at this point her career looks more like infamous! Stay away from this trash, i am done with watching anymore of her stuff."
tt6616074,"For a long time I thought amy was a bit overrated and mainly funny just in the sense that she had a lot of shock value. When this special was released the reviews I saw (netflix and here) made it sound terrible. However, I gave it a chance, and it was a fun special. Her routine is like talking to an honest, vulgar and informed friend. None of it was boring, she is animated in an engaging and of course self-deprecating way, and the whole thing was a joy to watch :) keep it up!"
tt6616074,This was pretty solid and I found pieces of this special funny but it was not of the caliber of her HBO special produced by Chris Rock. I thought even her first one hour future on Comedy Central Stand Up was better....I would like to see Amy work on her consistency. Chris Eock is the master of this. In his HBO specials they will literally clip and cutaway two different locations where he's performing the exact same bit and you do not even notice that they've changed his clothes his costume he's not in the same location because every night he does it the same.
tt6616074,"This was painful to watch. Save yourself the time and don't bother watching this train wreck (that lame pun was better than anything in this special). I have never been a big fan of Amy but she was better when she was stealing other people's jokes. Maybe she should search some old comedy tapes for new material. 1 star is generous for this slop.Edit: Apparently, she included bits that she copied from Dave Attell and Dave Chappelle in her Leather Special. She is a chronic offender. Even that wasn't enough to save her act."
tt6616074,"I have never given anything at IMDb a score of one in my life, until now. I thought Trainwreck was a decent film so when I stumbled upon her stand-up special on Netflix, I thought I'd giver it a spin. Now (to use a worn out cliché) I feel like I've lost 57 minutes and 2 seconds of my life I'll never get back. I sat and watched, and kept watching hoping it would get better but it never did. I never even smiled. Nothing funny here at all. Now I realize that there was a reason for the low rating by Netflix users (not to mention a pretty low score on IMDb too). History is made... and I would have given it a zero rating on the IMDb if they would have let me."
tt6616074,"Amy proudly proclaims she has a stinky vagina That's the entire comedic content of this showSubstitute the word ""vagina"" for ""comedy"" and it's accurate"
tt6616074,"Filthy, filthy dirty. Crude, vulgar and disgustingly unfunny. An insult to the viewer. What the hell was she thinking? Now that she's made a truckload of money from Trainwreck (which was delightfully inventive and charmingly funny) Schumer has taken a nosedive into the sewer and produced a special that needs to be flushed down the toilet. Every kind of bodily and sexual function is thrown haphazardly at the audience with no rhyme or reason except to prove that women can be foulmouthed skanks. The only thing Schumer misses out on is having a bowel movement onstage. I watched about fifteen minutes of this filth and switched it off. I used to like her as a comedian but if this is the best she can come up with then I'm outta here."
tt6616074,"This is as funny as an autopsy as graphic and as funny as I would imagine a public beheading to be.This special made me want to spend the entire day outside. She represents everything that America has to flush down the toilet in the morning. This is not humor, its more like sacrificing your brain."
tt6616074,"What was that exactly? No one cares about your genitals and sad stories you have of them. Seriously. Why? Why on earth would someone really think that was funny? Why?That was a disgrace for stand up history. It's not the misogynistic trolls that gave the bad reviews Amy. The reason for that was that it was horribly pointless and unfunny. As a woman who was unfortunate enough to born and live in a middle eastern fascist dystopia and as someone who tries to survive and protect my mental health by escapism on the internet -through vpn mostly-, I'd rather watch the usual censored propaganda news that are full of hatred, blood and pain than to endure this mess. At least they make me laugh hysterically by making me clinically insane.Worst thing ever."
tt6616074,"You know how when you see a show and it's so bad, it makes you squirm and feel embarrassed for the actor? I used to get laughs from her material, but this is just crude and boring. All of the material is really stale and has been used by Comedians for generations. If I have to see a sweaty fat person in a leather jumper, I'd rather it be a hairy drag queen- they would be more attractive. I'm not sure if she took a page out of Andrew Dice's playbook, but it's the same kind of vulgar and immature ""comedy""."
tt6616074,"She really isn't funny. I would have guessed she didn't have anything prepared, walked on stage thinking ""I got this""...and all we got was a heaping pile of crap. Unimaginative, not funny, flat out lazy. She's not even pleasant to look at. Game over dude."
tt6616074,absolutely disgusting content and the worst comedy show I have ever seen in my life.Now Amy is on my banned list.Even juveniles have better comedy skills.Watch at your own risk as you can feel getting restless as you keep watching it.i hated it.not funny at all.netflix should have never produced this and her blaming the alt right is hilarious and as a comedian total failure. she should take responsibility for the bad content.
tt6593054,Movie is an inspiration for all street racing drivers. Fast and furious series is nothing compared to this movie. And don't even get me started on the plot twists. I mean mind blown.. 10 out of 10.Superb acting skills. Definitely should be nominated for an OscarExcellent CGI. Better than AAA video gamesAmazing characterizationDid I mention plot twists?
tt6593054,"I don't understand how this movie was made. How come Karan Johar bankrolled this one? And why is it on Netflix?Movie is very very bad in terms of writing, directing and horrible dubbing and sound mixing. Feels like the makers had given up on this movie long ago.The only good thing about this movie is gorgeous Jacqueline. It's hard to take your eyes off here."
tt6593054,When i was watching the movie i couldnt get race 3 stupid twists from my mind .. this one went through the exact same way .. specially with jaq role which was very similar to her character in race 3 ....Both movies should be avoided for the safty of ur brain
tt6593054,"Drive, as we all know it, has got considerably delayed due to reasons best known to its makers. This fact has entirely ruined the movie. A storyline with so many plot twists could have been a canvas large enough to showcase a smart heist however it's all down the drain due to uninteresting screenplay, pathetic CGI (Need for Speed games have a better CGI and story), awful dubbing (you can actually see that the characters are speaking something else but the dubbing is entirely different) and bad action choreography. The director attempted a bold move by moving to an action genre after his debut movie which was a typical KJo level masala, but has miserably failed.Speaking about the efforts of actors, one can't review Jacqueline's performance because there ain't any. Sushant Singh had next to no scope in this one (all thanks to all the negatives mentioned above). Even stalwarts like Boman Irani and Pankaj Tripathi couldn't save the fall since their talent was badly used.Thank god this movie didn't see the light of theatres other wise, it would have been a waste of parts and audiences money.All in all, you can watch it if there's no better work to do. But if you do have something, then you can surely think to DRIVE pass this one without even a glimpse."
tt6593054,"Nothing original.
It was a combination of fast and furious,Dhoom and Stupidity. Very Bad dialogues and very stupid plot."
tt6593054,Feeling sorry for people who watched it including me and for almost all good actors in it we have seen their such good acting and emotions in other Bollywood movie just wanna explain in short KARAN JOHAR should get ban for online streaming apps
tt6593054,"Drive is honestly one of the most incompetent films I have ever seen. Whilst it is terrible on every single level, I enjoyed this film because of that.Drive follows a group of street racers that decide to commit a heist and along the way face deceit and betrayal.I can't deny how much fun I had watching this film. Everything is executed in the worst way possible that I couldn't contain my laughter. It's baffling to see a movie like this being made. Before Drive came out, I was actually excited about but the constant delays really made me worry. Then the trailer came out and it had some of the worst VFX work ever. The (un)finished product had the same problem. I don't understand why they decided to use visual effects for the chase scenes rather than doing it practically. IT LOOKS INCREDIBLY BAD!!! The film also has extremely obnoxious editing. The cutting and scene transitions were trying to make it look stylish but to me, it shows how inept the editor was.The film is written and directed by Tarun Mansukhani, who previously made Dostana. Dostana was nowhere near perfection but at least it wasn't as stupid as Drive. I don't know what he was thinking because the story is simply atrocious. This film is trying to act as if it's extremely clever but it's not at the slightest. There are many twists and turns which get tiresome and make no sense. Not only that, Drive has the most random song placements in a Bollywood film. There is this whole montage where the main characters go to Israel for absolutely no reason. They could have taken out that whole part from the film and it would have made no difference.It's also surprising to see the amount of talent on-screen being wasted. I like Sushant Singh Rajput. He is a good actor but he's terrible here. Rajput constantly gives these smirky looks with his face. I don't know why?! There also talented actors like Boman Irani and Pankaj Tripathi that are COMPLETELY wasted. Everyone's acting is disgraceful.I now understand why Drive was thrown into Netflix. I think they gave up after the amount of times they had to delay the film and just decided to release it on Netflix. This film fails on everything. There is not one redeeming factor I can think of. Drive is unquestionably the worst film of 2019 and one of the worst films I've ever seen in my entire life."
tt6593054,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIMEAfter watching this, even Salman Khan's movie will feel more LOGICAL and sensible"
tt6593054,"A great comedy movie, only problem is that it was not supposed to be one.
Bad Graphics(Cartoon Network Material)
Bad Races(Good Joke though)
No storyline, literally none.A sheer disappointment!"
tt6593054,"Sad, it wasn't launch on big screen. Now they should launch it and give tribute to late Shushant singh. I would like to give 10 marks for Shushant's overall performance in Bollywood. I loved your Kai Po Che, MS Dhoni, Kedarnath, Chhichhore. May your soul Rest In peace. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻"
tt6593054,"Watch it for sushant. If you like fast and furious franchise then you can try this. If stunts & CGI worked well then this movie would been a good movie, though it will not be boring but it has ton of logical mistakes. Cinematography & Music is ok. Definitely you can watch it for timepass."
tt6593054,"Performance wise it's nowhere near the original, the original one had a charm of gosling and background score was just perfection. I'm disappointed in Netflix to ruin this. Disaster starts from the casting. I am really disappointed."
tt6593054,"1) Sushant Singh has worn loud pink and red lipstick in most scenes. I think the makeup map mistook him with Jacqueline.
2) He is trying to immitate SRK so bad that the latter should cry watching this movie
3) Movie shot on such shoe string budget that Cars used in racing scenes are Swift and Nano.
4) Another adding to the former, racing sequences are so badly shot and since they didn't have a CGI budget in many scenes they have used screenshots of 1990s racing video games.
5) No logic no sense in story, the loopholes are more than dialogues.
6) It seems their accomodation to Israel was sponsored by Israel tourism. The whole song was shot by a selfie cam.
7) Did Big Boys Toys produce the movie? I'm guessing the budget would be less than equivalent to the price of one of his luxury cars tyres.
8) I'm guessing everyday before shooting, Jacqueline and Sushant woul binge watch Money Heist."
tt6593054,"No story, pathetic action, racing scenes could not be more badly shot like you will see in this movie. Jaqueline should consider giving up acting and instead sit on a throne in some laughter show. Same twist in the end as in all con movies. Do something fresh guys.."
tt6593054,"Its extremely difficult to dissapoint someone when their expectations are low, but SOMEHOW this movie was able to accomplish this.
Bad editing and dubbing.
The VFX artists looked like they were underpaid.
Watch it for the comedy because you'll be laughing AT the movie. Not WITH it."
tt6593054,"Drive begins like a wannabe Dhoom (2004) and ends like a dumber version of Dhoom 3 (2013). But without the imaginative prowess that these more popular Bollywood heist films at least had as director Tarun Mansukhani comes out of his cave after ten years to create a slipshod action drama based on street racing and gold heists with cardboard characters. For a Netflix production, it has a nauseating setup, terrible CGI, and most importantly, substandard cars - all of which take the fun out of watching the movie in just the first ten minutes. I mean it's grotesque to see all the usual tropes in the first few minutes of a film which is aggravated by poor performance by its cast; it almost feels like a poorly directed telefilm of the early 2000s. For a film whose x-factor is cars Drive has stupid-looking versions of Maruti Swift, Hyundai Verna, and Tata Nano in the spotlight. Well, I can hand it to the makers for not internationalizing it (till the first half) but I would expect at least some help from Dilip Chhabria. Even the gold bars - which are the central plot element that the characters are vying for here - look like cardboard versions that schoolkids make for annual project competition. There's a lot of thing wrong with Drive and they are all so awfully unaesthetic and out-of-place watching it becomes a form of self-hurting. I do not recommend it at all even if you are a fan of the lead actors who do nothing but disappoint with their unpolished dialogue delivery. It almost felt like I was watching Sushant Singh Rajput and Jacqueline Fernandez read out their lines with zero rehearsal or direction from Mansukhani. Easily the most ambitious failure of 2019. TN."
tt6593054,"Drive is influenced from Hollywood films..., featuring sharp racing, sleek cars, Girls in Bikini, and clever 'chors', but a very bad one.Sushant Singh Rajput and Jacqueline Fernandez both r *Dud* Actors..!!
Drive is so pointless that one wonders why on earth it is on a streaming platform. That is a mystery."
tt6593054,When you watching this movie you feel that you are on deja vu ride.. guys don't waste your time in this scrap
tt6593054,"Wasn't expecting Sushant Singh Rajput to fall for this thing....we appreciate him so much, like i watched his movie msdhoni once again yesterday with my family i swear we all had tears in our eyes again. what an amazing actor you are sir. i cant go through this movie without remembering hollywood movies. this hurts !"
tt6593054,"This was the only movie of #SSR I had not seen so watched for him only.
Can totally understand why this movie casted him and why it was released on OTT. May the producers rot in hell."
tt6593054,"The lowest rating I have ever given to any movie till now. Such a poor writing, worst cinematography etc etc what can I say. Terrible performance and acting by Jacqueline, what can we expect from her. I don't know why Sushant Singh choose this film WHY!!
CGI is horrible, far worse than mobile games."
tt6593054,The graphics are poorer than 90s videos games. A chliche story.
tt6593054,What kind of garbage is this? Its been 11 years and Jacqueline didn't learn how to act though the story line is bad.
tt6593054,"Worst acting, direction, vfx, screenplay and dubbing.
A college going kid can act better than Sushant.
Seems like something was stuck in Sushant's teeth. He kept on twisting his lips and mouth throughout the film.
VFX feel like old age GTA game."
tt8861802,"This should not be called 'How High 2'. How does this relate to 'How High'? This movie is so corny, nothing like 'How High'."
tt8861802,"This sequel was not funny and not even entertaining. The characters are very forgettable, none of the jokes are funny, there's no Redman and no Method Man. Redman and Method Man were great in the first movie, sure the first is not the best, but it's still funny and a classic. Mike Epps in this movie was not funny, he needs to pick better movies, because this movie is not for him. This sequel can go to hell for all I can care. They are a few jokes that are a little funny, but that's not enough to make the movie entaining or good."
tt8861802,"Has nothing to do with the first movie, it isn't funny at all. Really bad."
tt8861802,Not for nothin'; but nobody is gonna peep this without RED & METH.Just thought I'd let you know.
tt8861802,"Seriously who green lighted this and how broke is Mike Epps to do this garbage?Pretty basic, this is not How High 2, this is garbage. This is a terrible waste using a name of something that was good to try to sell.No one's buying."
tt8861802,Not worth the watch. Not having Red and Meth in it killed the whole idea of this even being a sequel to the original. This MIGHT have done better as a stand lone movie with a completely different title. Calling this a sequel to one of the greatest stoner movies ever is a blasphemous insult!
tt8861802,I gave the movie a chance. Watched it in full. Wasted my time. Yatchy cannot act. Movie is made for children with no sense
tt8861802,"No Method Man No Redman = No How HighThis is really bad movie and it missed everything
That made the first one good method man and Redman"
tt8861802,"I imagine that filmmakers must think that a stoner comedy easy money. ""stoners will like it"" is what they must say.
I grew up on the original. it's by no means an amazing movie, but a cult classic. up there with 'half baked', 'grandma's house' and 'Friday'.
a strongish cast with hip hop legends.
THIS. this is not that. I don't think anyone involved has ever smoked. no link to first movie so title is a cash grab.
I felt old as I didn't know anyone who I was supposed to.
the pink haired guy mumbled his way through while the other does a really bad Kevin Hart impression.
not even so bad it's good, just plain awful.
for me, this is by far the worst sequel of the year so far, maybe the worst movie, period.
please avoid at all cost, go rewatch how high."
tt8861802,"No method man, no redman..low budget acting..this movie is about as good as today's rap music and so is their acting. What a waste, couldve had a great sequel but nothing but a cash grab with the title. Don't waste your time or brain cells."
tt8861802,Bruh this movie is funny as hell thats all I gotta say
tt8861802,The only people who could of watched this and enjoyed was someone not in there teens and stoner when the original come out this is awful don't waste your time lil yatchy? Jesus bring back red and method!
tt8861802,This is my only 1 star rating I never give 1 stars but this movie is a piece of sh... I don't know what's wrong with these guys who made the movie but this is the dumbest embarrassed movie I ever see. How they could do this to fans from the first one ....
tt8861802,"This movie will flop!! What in the heck they was thinking by not having them in this movie!!??
Not worth watching..at all!!!"
tt8861802,I say half hour because I started it but couldn't finish it because it was so trash and corny. Not worthy of the title. If those mumble rappers respected the OGs they wouldn't have agreed to do this movie with that title.
tt8861802,"I waited so long for a how high 2, and turns out they do this abomination behind Red & Meths back.
Moral of the story is that the ""movie"" is bad and these guys should stick to mumbling"
tt8861802,This movie will be the biggest flop in movie history! How high 2 without Redman & Method Man is like a HIGH five... in the face... with a chair!!!!!
tt8861802,They need to beat up everybody that had anything to do with this movie. Terrible.
tt8861802,"A shame to the classic OG How HighAnd wtf is lil yachty doing on a movie set, he can't even rap nor act"
tt8861802,"Anyone who is saying it's good is obviously born in the early 2000's or later. The original was funny, followed a good story, and had GREAT rappers acting it. This is dumb, has 0 story line and bad rappers which makes for a bad movie imo.
Red and Meth made how high what it was."
tt8861802,"I'm in the middle of the movie, and i'm not stoned (yet)... That's why i need to say this now, when i still can... It's a good movie, i don't know... all of you...
Why so serious?
Nice comedy to watch in a sunny day. I have a banana smile from the beginning."
tt8861802,Dont know about the previous how high since was 1yr old so its dope love it
tt8861802,Don't watch this movie!! It sucks!!! They should of left it alone.
tt4160920,"Richie Rich is a lovable character, but it's his family that's the problem. His father is basically a couch potato with no job or aspects. The sister should be grateful they're all living in a big mansion, but all Harper does is complain. Not exactly the way a supportive sibling should behave.I got as far as episode 5 before realizing the family never leaves the house. Richie and his friends never set foot in school. They could've built a classroom set on the same stage, but they didn't.The worst plot is Richie converting his vegetables into energy. I mean come on that's pathetic."
tt4160920,"This show is a complete abomination. Other than Richie Rich, the other characters are completely one-dimensional and stereotypical:* Richie's jealous sister who most of the time is used only for a punchline
* Richie's accountant given the stereotypical dress (glasses, suspenders, etc.) and has no range of emotion other than ""Hey look at me I do nerd stuff!""
* A teen girl who overspends and, most of time, is characterized only by her obsession with consumerism. Although she is allowed some character development.But the most egregious character is the father: stupid does not begin to describe him. He has the maturity of a six month old, never got past the third grade, and is just there to be the big clown. Did all of the writers hate men or their parents?The jokes are lame and don't even deserve the obvious and overused canned laugh track. Laugh tracks should just be banned from sitcoms.I feel bad for all the young actors in this show, they deserved better than having deal with this drivel.Avoid this show."
tt4160920,"When I found out Jenna Ortega was in this show I had to watch it, after all I loved Stuck in the Middle and Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous. So I gave it a chance. Episode one broke me with the sexisim, objectification of a woman in a maid outfit by a child... I and then Jenna's character basically being a gold digger and the hapless dad... 5 episodes in and I couldn't take any more. Poorly shot, horribly written, toung in cheek acting, it was a disaster and not something I'd recommend for children at all!"
tt4160920,"This show is really bad. At first blush, it looks like a typical low-budget children's show, not unlike what you might see on the Disney Channel. But it has some huge problems. First, is that the Murry, Richie's money manager is a Jewish stereotype. For some reason, Richie Rich's money manager is a 12-year-old like him and has a bunch of Jewish money manager stereotypes. He also has a bunch of weakling nerd stereotypes, but those are just annoying, not insulting.The second problem is that the robot maid is a typical model in french maid outfit. It's weird that a kid that hasn't hit puberty yet (at least not in the first episode) would choose a blatant sex symbol. That said, she has the best lines. Heck, she's the best developed character. It's like the writers knew how terrible the concept was, and gave a bunch of great dialogue to compensate. The worst problem is Darcy, who is a girl Richie's age who 'spends his money' and otherwise acts like a vapid spoiled trophy wife/girlfriend. But she's twelve (or around that age), and they're not dating.It's unsettling to see young children acting out these adult tropes. The only actual adult (besides the robot) is a Richie's father, a man child who doesn't seem to have ever held down a job in his life. How he had two kids (Richie has an older sister) is beyond me. It isn't that I can't picture a woman having sex with him, it's that he's so immature I can't imagine him being interested.I'd stay away from this show. Far, far away."
tt4160920,"I don't think that this concept is something that will ever translate well from comic books to television or movies. The Richie Rich comics were funny because they described wealth so outlandish, that when Mom went to the East Wing of the mansion, she traveled by plane. Money gushing out of oil wells and vaults so big they were measured in acres. Stuff like that.Of course, that stuff does not translate to the real world very easily. Richie Rich may be a good comic for kids fascinated by money, since it teaches that friendship and family is far more important than money. But trying to translate that into a real-world TV show by papering the walls of Richie's bedroom with foreign banknotes just seems silly.The concept COULD work if it were ""dialed down"" a bit... Like a show about a kid in an extremely wealthy family who just wants to play with other kids and is a good person, but who has to contend with things like the security guards that follow him everywhere for his protection. Or who asks his Dad for lunch money on his way out the door and his Dad hands him a $100 bill because it is the smallest bill he has. Little jokes like that would at least be believable.But this series is completely over the top. I know that most movies and TV shows require a suspension of disbelief, but this one requires a suspension of your entire brain."
tt4160920,"I loved the Richie Rich movie (1994) with Macaulay Culkin when I was a kid. Of course, once I watched it again as an adult, I found some things in the movie just dumb, but I could still see why I loved it so much. It was well written, had a good plot, good actors, etc.This Richie Rich show, however, is simply bad. No, wait, I have a better word for it: horrendous. Story is pretty much inexistent, characters and dialogues are horribly written, and actors are just... not good. After watching a few episodes, I couldn't take it anymore.I know they are just kids that were probably just very poorly directed, but still, this is something else. They remind me of puppies that are avidly learning to do new tricks. In this case, their ""punchlines"" are the tricks, and the ""laughs"" are the rewards. And honestly, it gives a stink of desperation to the whole show. They kinda look like they are on speed or ecstasy too. Yep, a bunch of puppies on drugs, that's pretty much what they look like to me.And let's not forget the obviously objectified/sexualized robot French maid... She has the best lines, and she's a freaking robot! And just like all the other characters, she's an overused stereotype that is just inappropriate. It's like they took her character from a bad indie porn movie and put it in a kids show on Netflix.I don't often take time to review movies/series, but this show just made me so mad I had to vent somehow. I can't believe such a show can still be produced in 2015. It's sad for the actors, because you sense they do have potential and talent hidden behind the poor direction, but I officially brand this as unwatchable. There's too much wrong stuff at the same time, and I honestly don't understand how someone could enjoy it."
tt4160920,"So, this show is really terrible on every level. It has that typical absurd situational humor but that's not why I'm writing this.Let's start off with the fact that this kid becomes a trillionaire by not eating his vegetables. But the two things that get me the most are his sex symbol French maid robot slave and his walking stereotype of a 12 year old money manager. These two things do not belong in a children's show. His best (friend)?? Is a girl that spends all of his money and doesn't stop complaining. The main character himself a spoiled, selfish and suffers zero consequences for being an absolute donkey to his sister and his ""help"". The dad belongs in an institution of some sort for allowing all this behavior and for allowing his 11?? Year old to purchase a sexualized slave. I hate this show and it is now banned from this house. If you took any lessons from this horribly written show they would be:Treat everyone like your help Hold your money over everyone's headObjectify and buy attractive slave womenIf you're rich you suffer no consequencesDon't eat vegetablesTreat your family like they are meaningless"
tt4160920,"Literally the worst show I've ever seen. Horribly corny, Horribly bad acting, Horrible characters. The dialog actually sounds like the child actors wrote it. It amazes me that this show was ever green-lit. Also, As one reviewer pointed out, the show is actually borderline offensive. There are so many offensive stereotypes. I can put up with a lot of kids shows but this one is torture. Now to formulate a plan to convince my niece to watch something else... On a side note; What is up with the random little girl whose only purpose is to spend the kids money? And the creepily sexualized robot maid? Also, How does the father even feed himself. He should be placed in a home for the mentally challenged."
tt4160920,"I get that most kid shows are for entertainment and cheesy, but I must admit as I sat and watched the first season with my 8year old, I found myself more aggravated than with any other show I've watched on Disney or Nickelodeon. The ""teen"" robot maid in a maid costume and heels, the ""6yr old acting"" dad makes this show beyond cringeworthy. I've watched alot of Disney XD and Nickelodeon and yes they have their fair share of cheesy, but this brain cell killing show takes the cake. All the characters are weird and horrible actors. I understand why it was canceled, why it was picked up again, baffles me."
tt4160920,"So we have the:Rich kid who is easily manipulated by girl who wants his money.The girl who wants his money. The Jewish/Nerd accountant stereotype.The dumb dad.The non-existent mother.The sister (ok character).The slave robot (okcharacter)The plots are bad, the lines are bad, some of the actors are bad. It only appeals to a 1 year old. Even so I think that even THEY would get bored by the 3rd episode.I recommend never watching it. My little brother adores it, but I can see through its lies, DO NOT WATCH. Watch the film instead."
tt4160920,"Though this series shares the title as the 90's movie, cartoon, and comic books that preceded it, it takes place in a completely different universe.instead of being born into wealth, young Richie somehow eliminated the use for carbon fuel, by using his uneaten vegetables. he became a 'trillionaire' as a result, and moved his family (father cliff and older sister harper) into a huge dream mansion.though he gains a lot of material possessions (such as; a robot maid named irona, pet whales, jetpack, and amusement park), he is most concerned with staying connected with his two best friends; murray - his money manager (played by Joshua carlon), and darcy (played by jenna Ortega) - his 'money spender' .this is all explained in the opening credits by Richie himself (played by jake brennan).with the help of cgi and expansive and stylish set designs, a surreal utopia - which serves as a playground for Richie and his friends, is created. most events and activities take place in the makeshift living room or bedroom of 'master richie'. it's vital that they're nice to look at - which they are:)a little imagination from the viewers is needed to fill in a few blanks. as there are some things that either happen off camera, or are not explained at all. this is a nice touch, as it keeps us engaged. it's a fantasy world where anything can happen.the focus is wisely kept on the children. the average age of the cast is twelve - which is also the extent of the target audience. they all give energetic and charismatic performances in their distinctive roles. the story is mostly told through their eyes. Richie and his friends, as well as robot irona (played by brooke Wexler), have great chemistry. even the reoccurring non rapper 't-nice', aka taj, aka 'bulldozer's son' (played by Nathan Anderson), fits in effortlessly with the group.there's an interesting dynamic within. darcy and murray are polar opposites and don't seem to get along. it's unlikely that they'd even associate with each other had it not been for Richie - who seems to love them both equally, and is the glue that holds them all together.the older robot maid irona, is both an adviser and servant to Richie. despite not having any feelings, she sometimes acts as though she doesn't want to work. she appears human upon first glance, however, she talks in autotuned voice and is the subject of many special effects.the b plots are usually reserved for Richie's father cliff, and older sister harper. harper is an angry overachiever, desperate to get into Harvard university. she wants to carve a lane for herself, and is unimpressed with Richie's success.cliff is a lazy, jobless, barely functional, 'man-child'. he seems to learn from his children rather than the other way around. he wants to spend time with them, but mostly ends up helping, or hindering, harper's plans.the overall tone of the show is light, loud, and in a similar vein as some of the Disney tween sitcoms from the late 90's/early 2000's. this is not surprising as it borrows some of the same writers. though I don't find it to be anywhere near as obnoxious.sure, there's some slapstick, sight gags, and subtle references to bathroom humour, but they are few and far between. they don't get in the way of the colourful, fast paced action.there's also a fair amount of heart sprinkled throughout - without things getting too sappy. the intention is to entertain, not teach. this isn't high art and shouldn't be judged as such.there's a sense of wonder and comfort. each episode is a new adventure. 21 of them in total, span over two seasons - which makes it easy to binge. the show actually improves as it progresses . part of me wishes that it could have lasted longer. then again, it was best to end it before the actors outgrew their roles.it's been four years since it's debut. i'd definitely call it an unlikely classic! I only hope Netflix keeps it available for us to watch until our hearts are content :)"
tt4160920,"This series is awful, it's a travesty, my 8 year old son, after we had watched original film from the 90's wanted me to watch an episode just to see how bad it is. It is full of canned laughter as no real humans would ever laugh at the unfunny jokes, the silly storylines and the just plain annoyance and dislike that you will have of everyone in the series.Also, having a robot maid that is dressed like a stripper is not really what one expects in a kid's TV series. It is a travesty."
tt4160920,"This has got to be the worst series on Netflix. He ""jokes"" are lame, the characters are pathetic, and if the parents are so stupid family services would've taken him away from them. This show is so bad that they had to give it a second season to confirm that the first one was not an aberration."
tt4160920,"Nothing like the comics. Truly terrible. It should not been titled Richie Rich. The series would still be terrible, but at least actual Richie Rich fans wouldn't have been horribly disappointed."
tt4160920,"To put it simply, this show stinks. The laugh track is heinous. The acting is wooden and the jokes are lame.Avoid it at all costs."
tt4160920,"I never bother with reviews but this is pretty awful. I get it, it's a kids show. But this is poorly written, poorly acted and honestly just a really bad story line. 2 👎🏼👎🏼"
tt4160920,"I rarely review but I sat and watched an episode of this with my 11 year old daughter and have to say it's just awful! The sad part being it could have been good. There characters that play Richie, his dad and the maid seem to be talented actors/actresses who seem appealing to me as such, just not in this show. Why they would agree to do such trash just screams $$$$$$. The theme song makes clear that Richie is rich from ""not eating his vegetables"" and creating an alternate energy source. Yes, let's put that out there right off the bat for our kids to see. Then there's the fact that he allows one of his best friends to blow as much of his money as she wants but his sister has to try and trick him into finances and is jealous of his wealth. Or that his dad is still a stereotypical jobless deadbeat dad even though his minor son obviously has the means to provide for himself, just no one else. Like all well rounded kid shows these days only parent is present for some reason and it's the dad. He's a love able post 80's stoner type character who loves his kids but can't take care of himself let alone a family it seems, I like the actor that plays him though.Ritchie's maid is a ""super model model"" robot. I guess dad had no problem with him ordering her, you know since he's like, 10. She's an objectifiable character slammed into the middle of a children's show im guessing to attempt to pull some appeal from a slightly older pre teen genre? I can't image why else she's there.....if couldn't be to attract adults because it's clearly a children's show and there's no way anyone over 12, maybe 14 would watch this.In all I couldn't believe the writing when I sat down and watched a couple episodes. I colder believe the hook to not eat vegetables and I'm still wondering why these two kids have no guidance and don't go to school. The character could have been a great one considering the actors, the idea and writing is just all half assed"
tt4160920,"When I saw this on Netflix, at first glance it looked terrible.. But I'm happy I took a chance and watched it. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire series, and would recommend it to others to watch. Some of the writing is bad, but some of the writing is good as well. As with any series, with a bit of fine tuning, it has the potential to be great. The acting is very good in my opinion, and I feel like the actors (especially Jenna Ortega who plays Darcy, and Kiff VandenHeuvel who plays Cliff, Richie's father.) I really hope more episodes are made in the future, so we can see how the show, and their actors improve. I feel that many young ones alike will enjoy the show, seeing that it is very entertaining, and attention grabbing as the viewers can visualize themselves in the situations, and have fun watching the show. It's very fun and entertaining, I'm sure you'll love it!"
tt4160920,"The show has 0 humor and there's nothing in the plot, even when considering it's a kids sir, to carry it."
tt4160920,At first I hated it but the more I watched it the more I liked it. The writing is bad. The jokes are bad but sometimes their funny. I did get attached to the characters especially Harvor she is just really pretty. This show isn't that bad it just needs some better back backgrounds better writing better plots and better jokes
tt4160920,"If you think about a boy earning trillions of dollars then you think: ""Hey this is more money than cash is on earth, nice, well done"". The show includes many unfunny jokes, has litterally no story and is increadibly stupid, when you think about a maschine which transforms vegetables into energy?"
tt4160920,"Geez...c'mon producers! This series provides yet another example of stereotyping on American TV. 
white rich kidditsy girl that just likes to spend moneybespectacled boy that saves money and is a numbers geekand worst of all
robot slave girl dressed in maid outfit direct from a porn studio!I am raising two girls to be strong, independent, driven, positive women. The constant profiling of girls and women in TV is outrageous!Time for this sort of junk to get off the box."
tt7608028,The whole consept of the film is interesting and I haven't seen something similar but there was no story at all. Not even the classic horror story that someone dies and becomes a ghost or how someone becomes a killer.
tt7608028,"The Open House is a Netflix original movie and presently sits at no.55 on the IMDB bottom 100. So the IMDB community deems this to be the 55th worst movie ever made. I have to disagree, but there is no denying just how atrocious it is.It tells the story of a mother and son who move into an open house after a tragedy befalls their family. As per the usual trope weird things begin to happen in the property.The trouble is, well.................there are a lot of troubles but first of all the movie is..........wait, honestly I don't even know where to start here.Awfully paced, dreadful characters you simply can't care about, a billion unanswered questions, the film ultimately goes nowhere at all! Basically the only redeeming features the film has are marginally decent cinematograpgy and a beautiful setting.The Open House is fully deserving of all the poor ratings, it's the absolute pits.The Good:Beautiful locationThe Bad:Cliched to incredible levelsUnlikeable charactersServes no purposeThings I Learnt From This Movie:Nothing, in fact I'm pretty sure it caused brain leakage so I've probably forgot some stuff"
tt7608028,"Most of the 1 star reviews articulate the problem really well but if you're still unclear allow me to communicate it in another way.Imagine you walked into your living room and saw Frank Sinatra playing world of warcraft. Then your neighbour came round several times and said some weird stuff to you. Then your cat takes a dump in your bed and moos at you. Then you start singing the lyrics to YMCA while Eiffel 65 is playing 'I'm blue' in the backgroundSo you must be asking yourself, What was the relevance of sinatra and why world of warcraft? Why did my neighbour come around and what did they say? Why did your cat moo and why sing YMCA to a different tune?The truth is...no reason at all. None of it related to anything. Pointless. No connection. Nothing"
tt7608028,What??? There was no ending?? It was pointless to even watch! A waste of time for the viewer.
tt7608028,"Good job Netflix! You bought total crap! After watching this I can't help but feel like the ""writers"" of this trainwreck are sitting in their beanbag chairs and taking turns patting each other on the back. Instead of congratulating themselves they should be taking script writing classes. This was the laziest piece of crap that I have seen in a VERY long time. ""Oh! We have a great idea for a movie!...I mean...we don't have any structure and we don't have a clue how to finish it...but maybe people will think we're geniuses for just phoning in the entire ending of the movie!""Listen...there are no spoiler alerts here. This movie is a complete waste of time. If these two morons ever hope to make another movie...maybe they should learn something about structure...plot...climax. I feel like this movie was written on a napkin at a Denny's and then left on the table and the busboy decided to make it.It's just awful. Stay away. And pray they never make another film in their lives. There are too many talented writers and directors out there to waste any time on these two. There...I said it."
tt7608028,"I completely jinxed this movie by saying how good it was halfway through.I've seen some pretty horrendous horror films in my lifetime, but you expect them to be horrendous because they are what they say on the tin. Cheap and easy.This film is the opposite, it's deceptive and not in a ""ahhh wasn't expecting that"" sort of way. More a feeling of being completely ripped off and dissatisfied kinda way.
 We honestly really enjoyed a good majority of this film, so many things that look like they're building up to a really good twist at the end. Mysterious characters, red herrings, things that could be linked together in a really cool way.How naive and utterly wrong we were.There is no point to this film. Literally, why was this film made?
It's like they employed a really good writer for the first half of the film who put together a brilliant structure and then some idiot decided to take over and realised he/she was in over their head. 
By the last shot I was honestly screaming ""DO NOT ROLL CREDITS"" and my sister had to restrain me when the goddam screen went black.This review may seem extra, but I have never been so angry, frustrated and disappointed by a potentially great film.I urge you not to waste your time. I have to go cool off and try and forget the fact I ever watched this piece of rubbish."
tt7608028,"I really don't know what happened here. It started off well, but then it just kind of fizzled. The acting wasn't bad, but the writing was. Certainly nothing original about the plot. I was really expecting more from this movie. Overall its just 90 minutes of my life that I can never get back.It almost seems like they just ran out of money and decided to just go ahead and end it.It will leave you unsatisfied and with a bunch of questions that will likely never get answered. Netflix must have acquired this movie for a bargain basement price not caring about their subscribers. Please no more recommendations Netflix"
tt7608028,"I thought the movie started really good, building up to something interesting...but boy was I wrong.Still wanna say that the lead characters were very good and acted reliably.After like 85% of the movie I was looking forward to see how the writers was gonna tie at least some of the knots together...but boy was I wrong again.We, the audience are left in total darkness without an answer to a single thing what so ever.Hmm, getting tired of writing this review now so I'll stop here and go on to watch another hopefully much much more satisfying movie.To all you moviebuffs out there...don't bother with this one. /J"
tt7608028,"When I'm on my death bed and about to slip away, I'm really going to wish that I could get back the 90 minutes of my life that I lost watching this crock of shiz.
I feel sorry for the actors because, apart from Martha, (what was the point of her?) they weren't to blame.
It was the diabolical ""writing"" which let this film down.
The trailer was really promising but the rest of the film was soooo pointless. Unfortunately, you don't realise this until the end. The end - what the heck was that all about??
I'm just annoyed that I didn't have an early night and save myself from the huge disappointment of watching this film.
Save yourself - don't bother!"
tt7608028,"I am not surprised by the low reviews, and the low score, I have to say I enjoyed it. I get that it doesn't have a black and white conclusion, that ambiguity in the end of a film can irritate some, but I'd like to highlight The Strangers, a similar outcome, but a masterclass in movie making, and while The Open House doesn't even come close it raises a few questions. The ending was probably done in that way to allow for a second, and I wouldn't be shocked to see an Open House Part 2 made. Solid performances, Dylan Minnette, who's always pretty good put in a solid performance, I thought the scenes where he lashed out in anger to his mother about his father's death were very well played out, films so often go way over the top, this had a sense of realism.When you think that the budget for this film was $100,000 I think it should be applauded, many films with budgets many times that size fail in so many ways, this was a good hour and a half of escapism.It's not to be taken too seriously, and we didn't get many answers, but that's life.I quite enjoyed it."
tt7608028,"All I can figure is the writer died of a stroke about 1/4 of the way through and Netflix said f it, let's run it like it is. This was an abomination."
tt7608028,"Everything leading up to the end seemed intentionally misleading into absolutely nothing. Cheap scares that led nowhere. Random killer whose face they never show. Half the fun of these mystery/thriller films is trying to guess the killer. In Scream, the killers were throughout the whole movie! This one just followed a boy and his mom grieving and getting scared shitless for whatever reason. It's like a short story that got stretched into a movie that never should've happened. It may be good for a campfire story but even then not so much. It's an incomplete garbage of a movie. Awful awful awful...
...awful."
tt7608028,It's like the makings of a good movie wrapped in a bow...then someone opened the box and woosh it all flew out willy nilly with no purpose or reason...wasted my friday night...I want that time back
tt7608028,"What the heck did i just watch? I need answers.. if you are reading this & planning to watch this film, don't! It's going to give you more questions in your life & waste absolutely your time.. XD I love thriller films but this has gone too far that it's way too vague."
tt7608028,"Over arching story was absent, 'scary' aspects weren't scary at all, and I found myself checking my phone most of the movie."
tt7608028,"Movie starts off pretty good, was enjoyed the first half.Then it kinda felt like the writers got bored and couldn't be bothered putting in any effort for the second half.The trailer made it look good..."
tt7608028,I was really looking forward to this film. When the film started I was totally engaged thinking this was going to be a great film. Unfortunately that quickly fizzled when I realised there was only 18 minutes left and there hasn't been any action yet. Things only start to actually happen in the last 12 mins and even then it isn't really that interesting. What a waste of my time. Shame though because dylan minnette is brilliant like he was in 13 reasons why just a shame this is his first movie since that. :(Poor Show Netflix - Poor Show :(
tt7608028,"So not a clue who, why and the end gave no clues sorry but it was a waste of my time,"
tt7608028,"Omg! What a crapfest. Me and my wife just watched this movie after reading the negative reviews written on here. No big deal. Its a free download, so I said what's the hell. Boy were reviews spot on. This was so freaking bad, we had to watch it to the very end, to see if there were gonna be any redeeming qualities left. Not one answer to the who what when where or why of this s....tfest. This was my first 2018 review of pure crap, and when. I say crap, I'm being nice. AVOID at all cost. There are enough reviews on here to read that concur this movie sucks major ass. There is absolutely no plot to this film....NONE And to the writers of this garbage. You are clueless to what film making is all about. To the actors, if getting a paycheck is all you want ,then you need to change your careers. This was by far the very worst of the worst."
tt10886166,"There is no plot to speak of, the dialogue is disjointed, the storyline is disjointed, and the ending is a joke... but don't kid yourself that you're watching for any of these things."
tt10886166,"I don't remember if I have reviewed another movie so far, but seeing so many 10/10 reviews determined me to log in to write this, to ballance things up a bit.The movie is pretty bad. The plot (if you can call it that) is mostly absurd and the events are cliche and totally predictable (try to remember what somebody did or said in all the bad movies that you ever saw: yes, it's exactly what's going to happen), the events don't make a lot of sense, the dialogue is cringe, the characters are very cartoonish and unbelievable. What they say don't make a lot of sense, and also nobody reacts to events in the way a normal person would do. These are comic book characters, not people. When they try to suggest some of these people are crime lords it's hilarious, you can't help but chuckle. Real mobsters would have these guys for breakfast. Ironically, the fly girls in the movie are actually more believable, because the way they live it is more close to some girls I know.I never saw any of the ""Shades of Gray"" movies, but for a good part it felt like a relative of those movies. The sex scenes are pretty convincing, I'm still unsure if the oral sex was actually simulated or not.The good things I can say about this are (and each gets a star from me):
the photography is pretty good, at least the cinematographer knew what he was doingthe actors are generally pretty easy on the eye, the costumes are also solid, there are nice and diverse locations, hence there is always something appealing to look at on the screenthe sex scenes are pretty good if you're into that kind of thing (I am)Should you see it? Well I don't know, even with the low score that I gave it, I feel like people should make up their own mind and not take someone's else opinion on it. Besides, I think people should watch bad movies from time to time, to be able to understand better why other movies are good, and to be more appreciative of those, as a consequence.So yeah, go watch it, but keep your expectations ridiculously low."
tt10886166,Probably one of the worst movies of the century so far
tt10886166,I honestly can't believe this is an actual movie and number 1 on Netflix in my country.
tt10886166,"This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen.
The dialogues between the main characters are unbelievably cringy and the plot literally doesn't make any sense. Don't watch this movie unless you wanna waste 2 hours of your life just to give this movie a (probably) 1 star rating too."
tt10886166,The cringe levels runeth over. The English is almost as bad as the plot. If you want to watch this movie do so as a drinking game. Did you cringe? Then take a shot my dude. You will be wasted by the end.
tt10886166,"I do not even know where to start. Look, this is nothing but straight up porn. The plot is ridiculous, the chemistry between the two leads is nonexistent, and the acting is even worse. Trust me when I say, you will watch this in fast forward. It is that horrible!"
tt10886166,"I honestly don't know who thought that this movie would be a good idea. It is a complete train wreck for multiple reasons.One of the biggest issues is the plot is just nonsense. It is inappropriate to have a man deiced that he will hold a woman captive and she will love him. That is just not ok and i don't know why they made a movie romanticising this idea. The male character is a creep. He assaults the female character multiple times and it is not shown as a bad thing. It's just like he is a man and he has power so he can do what he likes. It is really really bad. Beyond that they just do variations of the same scene 6 different times. This movie is just the same scene over and over again broken up with random montages with a song played over it.The actions of the characters are nonsensical too. She has been kidnapped in a foreign country and then the next day there is a shopping montage where she is just like ""woo lets go buy some new clothes"". Like that just wouldn't happen, you would be terrified and she just acts like fine with it. I feel like they try to get the audience on side by making her current boyfriend a horrible person. I think they think the audience will be like ""oh that's good she got away from him"". Yeah she did get away from her bad boyfriend...by being kidnapped by an Italian mobster who is holding her captive????The second issue is the leads can't act and a lot of the movie is just them interacting so its like watching an amateur dramatics troupe half of the time. Now i can't work this out but this woman who is kidnapped never seems scared like at all. I can't deiced if this was the direction she was given or she just can't act or the script said she isn't scared. She literally wakes up after being kidnapped and tried to open the door to get out, can't because its locked and is just like ""Yeah fair enough"" and just sits down like this happens every day.On top of that the scenes with the male lead pushing her against walls and stuff she pulls like ""Posing, modelling"" faces and is not like ""Jesus Christ the man is assaulting me help"". Once again was this the direction or was it the acting who's knows?It also relies heavily on ""Pop"" songs that are really loud and unnecessary. They constantly play one after the other and then when reading i found out the male lead sung like a big chunk of them so i guess production was just like ""well he will give us them cheep let's throw them all in"".I could go one about all its problems but it all circles back to the directing, acting and the script. It was just a perfect storm.Believe it or not it is watchable but in a way that you want to watch it to see the disaster. It is the no1 viewed film on a large amount of different countries Netflix's at the moment and i believe this to be the reason.So its really up to you if you want to watch it. It is very boring but also a train wreck."
tt10886166,It's Garbage if you're looking for great storyline but if you want to enjoy pure erotic romance yes it is a consummate time pass for you.
tt10886166,"A mobster has a woman he's never met kidnapped and when she awakens from the drug given to knock her out, he informs her that she'll be living as his prisoner for 365 days. If after this period she hasn't fallen in love with him, he says he'll let her go. And, this weird rape fantasy ends up proving that in the end that the woman DOES want to be dominated, abused and forced to be a sex slave because the man is so sexy hot.I honestly think that the folks responsible for ""365 Days"" know they created an evil and dangerous film....and that was their intention. Sure, it's irresponsible to make a movie promoting kidnapping and sexual assault...and I cannot imagine any normal person thinking this is a good thing or that it would make a good movie. No, I think the filmmakers knew the film would get a lot of hate and anger...and as a result, it would get a lot of attention. In other words, if you can't make a good film to get attention, make a terrible one to get attention. And, not surprisingly, this film has earned a spot on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List.So is the film good in any way? The plot that is pro-rape and pro-kidnapping certainly isn't good. Technically speaking, the film also has a few issues.....though it is slick and 'hip' much of the time. While they do a lot of gimmicky cinematographic techniques to make the movie look good, it also often falls back on the tired use of the shaky cam. Additionally, the film turns out to be disappointing even as pornography, as you really don't get much enjoyment or sexual energy from most of the picture. You'd do much better just looking at porn online or just making consensual love with your own partner! Overall, a smarmy little picture...one that unfortunately DID get the negative attention they filmmakers wanted but which also contributes nothing positive to this world and is rather boring.In real life, I am trying to imagine an offender in court telling the judge ""I was just doing what I saw them doing in ""365 Days""...is that so wrong?!""....and promptly being sentenced to 104 years in prison!"
tt10886166,"This hardly qualifies as a film. It's basically porn with some random cringey lines and scenes stringed together. The actors can hardly even be called that and the direction is below amateur. The film essentially romanticizes kidnapping and rape too, and for that it should be ashamed. This is truly the bottom of the barrel for 2020."
tt10886166,"Never seen such horrible movie in my entire life. The concept, acting, scenes, basically everything is wrong in this movie."
tt10886166,"This movie is porn for Karens who think they're too good to watch actual porn, so they watch this ridiculous rape-fantasy garbage instead (another example being 50 Shades of Grey). Of course, filmmaking wise, it's an insult to everyone's intelligence and has some of the worst production I've ever seen. I can't believe Netflix is paying money to stream this. I've seen pornos that are legitimately better films."
tt10886166,"Such stupid, worthless, toxic story line . Glorification of relationships where the sole role of a woman is to be a slave and fulfill the desires of a harsh , egotistic ,rich male character."
tt10886166,"This movie is legit the third worst movie I've ever seen. Incoherent plot, stupid characters, completely illogical in every sense of the word. My advice would be to avoid this hot mess at all costs."
tt10886166,"Wow, how corny can a movie get and what were they thinking, it's so corny it can be rated as a comedy movie. They collected every cliche from the book of cringe and romance and shoved them in a movie. I can't even humor the movie by listing the things that are bad with it, doesn't even deserve the time or effort, the two hours I wasted watching it were more than enough."
tt10886166,"Ugly....for any women....................nothing else to say..i had to shut down this stupid video, its a shame on all women today and a shame that its on nb 1 on netflix...tells all about our comunity"
tt10886166,"I don't understand what's the bad reviews all are about. i think this is a good erotic movie, the cast is on point, the acting is good, the plot could've been better tho i mean wtf is that ending?? i am dying. i need a closure dammit. but overall this is a really good movie flicks"
tt10886166,Such a rip off from fifty shades of grey. The plot and character development is all over the place. Some things didn't make any sense at all. The ending was horrible. Where's my 2 hours gone?
tt10081210,The only reason I am giving one star is for 'THE END' title.
tt10081210,"This is really cheesy, and terrible. It's not got any tension or atmosphere at all. The child is really unlikeable, and bratty. The editing is not great, so it doesn't flow well.The effects are so bad it's comedic. Like if the child weren't so annoying, this would be worth watching with friends for a laugh.There's also little things that annoy me, like the house they live in looks like a show room, not any kind of home. The lighting is really weird, and makes everything look over exposed. Which also takes away from the atmosphere.The music is way too intrusive, like you are always aware of it. And it's rarely complimentary to the scene."
tt10081210,"Movie is very nice. Do not believe fake reviews, watch the movie.
Baby girl acting is good."
tt12775836,"The plot lacked any form of novelty. It's trying too hard to be a path breaker by following the same path again. They pulled in a couple of stand up comics for guest appearance but didn't really give them any screen time. Jokes are mostly old, over used and unfunny. Couple of characters abs performances were just dead and Ofcourse they had to put in a modi joke and UP noida joke because they need to feel woke!2 star rating for the audacity and efforts. Watch it if you have nothing else to do with your life."
tt12775836,"My review has been given for my favourite actors Girish and Mona, and both are very good performer all time. Otherwise, I don't have much interest to watch this series."
tt12775836,"7 and above are from Congress IT cell. So grow up man, keep art as art."
tt12775836,"I just watched the first episode and now cannot take it more. Swara bhaskar is not justifying the character at all. The director could have cast someone more realistic character. We already have lots of stand-up comedians who can easily catch up this role.
overall for me it is a waste of time."
tt12775836,"Tired jokes, what's ap forward kinds, poor timings, poor delivery, jarring looks, tried too hard, amateurish all the way. Better avoid to not waste time."
tt12775836,Couldn't get paid ep1. Pure trash. Wake up Netflix India!!!!
tt12775836,"Totally time wasting story
Swara acting 👎
Don't waste time full bkwas"
tt12775836,"A show about stand up by people who have no clue about stand up. Bad casting. If people want to see a good show about stand up where a housewife turns to stand up and freaks out her family and dumps her husband, there is Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Which is well made, nuanced, terrific actors, well scripted. Why would someone want to watch a copy that too a bad copy of a non existent comedy scene. What the hell is the point of this show! Who is your audience? If its for the Americans, they have better fiction on stand up as they have a long lasting tradition of stand up. If this is made for Indians? Then well it was a waste as a more interesting take would be to show the way stand up scene is just taking off in India and why?
Like who the hell is running NETFLIX in India? Fire them! One horrible show after the other this year!
Thanks for wasting my time. I really tried to like or at least watch this show."
tt12775836,It wasn't a sleek comedy but it had its moments. Swara's and Ravi's acting was good. I had fun watching it.
tt12775836,Netflix should give some attention while selecting series. This is pathetic and since I have watched one episode Netflix should payback my money.
tt12775836,Yet another well made Indian show on Netflix! Don't let the low ratings dissuade you from watching it.It's all in the nuances. Indian Netflix shows are meant for the kind of person who appreciates the small but very important details in the dialogues and story.This series yet again features an empowered woman and the pressures and micro aggressions she has to fight every single day just so she can do something she loves.Beautiful acting. Light and funny. Really looking forward to the next season.
tt12775836,Extremely boring ! No acting skills ! Overacting actors ! No concept in story.
tt12775836,Ignore the one stars... This deserves atleast 6.5 rating...
tt12775836,"The episodes are boring and actors need to work on real acting skills.
Casting crew need to be more cautious choosing the cast, and not based on who is who's son or daughter.
Also, the storyline needs some rewriting to make this series less clichéd."
tt12775836,Swara Bhaskar's acting is cringeworthy at best. Not to mention lack of imagination or any kind of originality in script. This is a very poor adaptation of Marvellous Mrs Maisel. A total disappointment from Netflix. To be avoided at all cost.
tt12775836,"Story was okay but the acting by the lead actress was atrocious.
Dolly Singh did a good job though.. wish she was the leading lady. :/"
tt12775836,"Only word i have for this ""nothing new, typically stereotyped"""
tt12775836,It's a waste of time . Very boring and waste of time
tt12775836,"Story of young aspiring stand up comic artist who leave her job just to become a comic and she had family who want her to get married to rich brat so they can relief themselves from her responsibilities, a fiance who love her but don't acknowledge the respect for her career choices, she ran away from marriage to just for a stand up comic night and another comedian see her and try to help her with her joke making, better her script, help her with certain other things and beanie thought that it love when truth came out about his wife and life issues then only she realised that something is wrong and 6 episode series have some real life struggle of stand up comic that after so many year we are still not able to find a steady audience for the career option."
tt12775836,"Bad bad bad. Just too bad a watch. Felt like puking just after 15 minutes into the first episode. Bad casting. Predictable jokes aka whatsapp forwards. Nothing worth watching. If you don't love your time and money, watch all episodes for sure."
tt12775836,"Bjp it cell spammed the show because of swara, the show is good"
tt12775836,"I watched the trailer, I got a hint what this will be, then I took a look at an episode and my hint got confirmed. This is a story which has been told millions of times in India since 2 decades and every stand-up comedian ever has played this broken record. If I could have a dollar every time it plays.It is almost condescending that the same message is being pushed over and over with the mindset that either Indians are not understanding or that every Indian must become a standup comedian, because this has to be what everyone wants, right? NO! A lot of us aspire to be doctors and engineers, hate us all you want, we are not going away.At this point I feel Ekta Kapoor and Standup Comedians have ironically become the status quo in entertainment, and a counter culture drive is needed to pull them down from their privilege.On top of all this, It does not help that, Netflix as a platform, is a private company owned, instead of a market regulated one, because of which they force keep their mediocre produce to the top for an entire week. I find it disappointing that Netflix India has a very superficial and sometimes wrong interpretation of what people are looking for."
tt12775836,"The six episode series is not hilariously funny but it has its moments. Some punches are funny but some go totally flat. The star cast shines in this series. Swara, varun, dolly and ravi do a convincing job but the writer disappoints. And swara looked really beautiful in this series. One time watch"
tt3053228,"Zombie movies have literally been done to death, no pun intended. Nowadays the expectation is for something slightly less unoriginal, with a huge budget, and the usual shocks and scares. Sadly this one fails on both counts, there is absolutely nothing original, and the budget was evidently fairly low, as at times it looks a little cheap. The start was pretty decent, and the Zombie stalker thing was perhaps a little different. The acting was sadly a little below par too.4/10"
tt3053228,"Why is it with a budget of 8 million you cant make a better version than the original which cost a mere $3,000,000; its not rocket science but I guess you need a Romero at the helm.Not very scary or claustrophobic like the original was, woeful acting, illogical situations. cheddar cheesy dialogue and blood shooting out like a hose made it comical - The Walking Dead has it spot on so why not just copy if you dont have a clue what you are doing. I wont mention the ending which had the entire audience laughing - Oh my what were they thinking? And to add insult to injury the thrash metal ""nettle-rash"" music as my old dad used to call it at the end credits really did aggravate an already aggravated viewing sesh!Its not awful - the people who give 1 star are as bad as the shills who give 10/10 to every movie they review and havent a clue what the ratings systems means - 1 star means its the worst movie you have ever seen; watch ""THE BAD BATCH"" with Keanu Reeves then come back and tell me you would still give this a 1 star.To be fair Johnathon Schaech did a pretty good attempt at the original Bubba-zombie (he was the best actor in the whole thing) and the effects were not bad. The Dawn Of The Dead remake has been one of the best Zombo remakes but sadly this one is not. How very disappointing I must say! We can only hope Peter Jackson gets his Zombie movie that he has been talking about for over a decade off the ground, until then I guess us die hard zombo fans will have to make do with The Walking Dead!A fair 3/10 from me!"
tt3053228,"I gave this movie a chance on Netflix after discovering it on DVD at Wal-Mart. I listened to my wife and streamed it. I am a lifelong zombie horror fan. I own any and every imaginable zombie movie you can think of that is worth owning and have given a chance to quite a few that I have not bought. I am praising the gods today for my wife being with me at Wal-Mart that day and telling me to hold off on buying this. If there is a rating less than B-rated, this movie is not on that scale. It is without words the biggest crock of garbage I ever watched. First of all, let's talk about the acting. How dare you put the holy name of ""Day of thr Dead"" on this and sully the name of George A. Romero! This is a travesty and an insult to his legacy. The acting is terrible, even by zombie film standards. Now, do not get me wrong, but on paper the story was interesting, but come on man! ""Miguel"" was a trainwreck from his first appearance. These jackoffs basically attempted to combine the cowardly Miguel Salazar with the jerk Captain Rhodes. It didn't work. Oh, and we gave him a brother! Hot damn, a zombie apocalypse is fun for the whole damn family! I am fairly certain that the studio responsible is shitting themselves now as they realize they wasted $8 million on a budget for this shit heep. For $8 million, I could write, direct and produce a zombie movie that would make the almighty George smile and approve. And I can find better actors AND hire a special effects team that knows how the human anatomy works! Recommendation(s): DO NOT WATCH IF YOU'RE A TRUE ZOMBIE HORROR FAN!"
tt3053228,"I built this account just to warn people how bad this film is. save yourselves and dont watch it, its the worst low budget everything under the sun including acting. a film by fans for fans,of themselves...it should be a crime to use ""day of the dead"" for garbage like thisRomero is rolling in his grave right now"
tt3053228,"Just all around a dreadful occurrence in film history. The main protagonist checks all the boxes on the ""dumb things to do in an apocalypse"" checklist. Add to that the massive plot holes and bad acting and you get a recipe for failure.While the main character is the absolute repository for bad ideas you'd be amazed at how stupid the other characters can be, it's as though they all want to die. For example in one scene zombies flood into the area, this is followed by one of the characters running TOWARD AND PAST the horde of zombies, followed immediately by the protagonist. Naturally these flesh hungry zombies let both individuals pass without harm after all we're watching a terrible movie.All of this hullabaloo because she needs a zombie alive. Following this massive plot hole what does she do? She kills the one she wanted alive.This movie is garbage don't bother watching it, I'd watch a 100 hour marathon of The Wiggles before I watched this again."
tt3053228,Why are people intent on wasting money making poor movies. After 2 minutes you can clearly tell that this is going to be an awful movie. Since when do people explode blood when bitten. What was the zombie wiping the wind screen with blood inside the car all about? Poor script with even worse acting.
tt3053228,"First, I'll be entirely honest. I absolutely hate remakes. 99% of them are utter crap, made by no talent pinheads trying to use an existing success to lure chumps in to see their crappy, ill thought out tax break films. This is no different. I didn't think that there could be a worse remake of Day than that horrible 2008 version, but this one is EVEN WORSE. Someone should make a movie where George Romero comes back as a Zombie and KILLS everyone even thinking of making another remake of one of his movies. This has everything bad. Acting. Storyline. Plot. Even the zombies are bad. At 90 minutes long it felt like three times that. Just a horrible waste of time."
tt3053228,"The way people's blood exploded is worth 10 stars hahaLots of gore. The plot I thought was quite original for a zombie flick. Simple but original. 
It's just a not-to-be-taken-too-seriously zombie flick to make you and your mates laugh. Good times."
tt3053228,"When another remake of Day of the Dead was announced, the horror community was already up in arms. And for good reason. The last two attempts at ""reinventing"" Romero's nihilistically grim third installment in his ""Dead"" series were total unmitigated disasters. And from the sounds of it, this one was going to be no different...Low and behold, the film is released to scathing reviews left and right. And I won't sit here and pretend I don't get it, because I do, but I will say this...for whatever the hell it's worth, I personally thought it was very fun. It's trashy, cartoonishly violent (literal EXPLOSIONS of blood whenever someone gets bitten) and just plain silly at times. But I think that's why it works. It reminded me a bit of the Italian zombie flicks that were made in the wake of Dawn of the Dead and it seemed more focused on being an entertaining movie than trying to top the original.The cast is generally pretty poor with Sophie Skelton making a bland protagonist (a sort of cross between Sarah and Dr. Logan from the original), Jeff Gum being an incredibly lame substitute for Joe Pilato's legendary Captain Rhodes and Marcus Vanco just being plain old boring. The big exception here would be the top-billed Johnathon Schaech as our main antagonist Max. Max is essentially meant to be this movie's version of Bub, but whereas Bub was a lovable and sympathetic character, Max is a flat-out despicable monster from the get go. He makes a solid villain and the scenes where it's just him interaction with Skelton are genuinely effective. The third act really picks up thanks to shifting its focus mainly onto him.So at the end of the day, it's not going to blow anyone's minds and if you walk into it wanting something on par with the original, then you're just asking to be disappointed. But if you're craving some old-fashioned splattery direct-to-video zombie action, you'll probably have a fun time with it."
tt3053228,"This is one of those time when I wished I had listened to my gut feeling. It said avoid this trash but I was like how bad can it be? As bad as Day of the dead Contagion (a turkey which had nothing to do with the original movie)? As bad as the Steve Miner one? It is on a par with the Miner movie. It just feels like a generic zombie trash movie. Like zombies of mass destruction or zombie planet to name two from the cannon of so bad they are awful zombie movies. 
The movie itself is just generic zombie schlock. If they had called in zombies in Mexico then it just would have been a 2 out of ten trash movie. Saying it is based on the George Romero movie is an insult. 
Watch this at your own peril."
tt3053228,"I am getting sick, really sick, of these hacks ""remaking"" classic horror movies. This is a theft of a name/brand. This is not even a zombie movie. Its a total mess and a joke. Zombies aren't stalkers. Blood does not spray out of a humans body like a fire hose. With the budget they had for this, they could have at least found some people who could act their way out of a wet paper bag. They failed. Even DOTD 2 Contagium was better written and acted, and my dog could crap out a better movie than that turd.I wanted the main girl to die within 30 seconds of seeing her character on screen. She caused the death of almost every character by her stupidity. But hey, all she had to do was take some blood from her stalker zombie ex-patient, who tracked her down from the smell of her panties, and she saved civilization. Great writing.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP! 'nuff said"
tt3053228,"From what I understood, Day of the Dead Bloodline is supposed to be a remake of Day of the Dead (1985).Now I must state for the record that I am not a fan of remakes as they usually fall flat, and I can't understand the need for them in the first place, and it shows a lack of originality as well.With that statement out of the way, Day of the Dead Bloodline was in fact far inferior to the original Day of the Dead, though to be fair it bares very little in common to the original.The acting was amateurish and the script was poorly written.
The effects were actually pretty good, with the only exception being blood constantly expelled with explosive force from people being attacked, which is fine if you are watching a comedy but not so much in a supposed horror movie.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this movie, though if you have nothing else to do and want to watch it, go ahead, just don't expect something memorable."
tt3053228,"The movie started out so so.What totally made me think this is crap is when they all of a sudden made the zombies clever. The one zombie is now a stalker and only goes after the specific woman.
Its like a serial killer/rapist stalker movie but using a zombie do it.They could not make up their minds if they wanted to make a zombie movie or serial killer thriller.Zombie carrying a grudge and angry after seeing the woman he is after kissing her boyfriend. I mean come on, really.Zombies is supposed to be brain dead and only want to eat the living, in older movies zombies were slow as well, now they break records running sprints here. But i can still live with that, just not the genius stalker serial killer zombie.The rest got spoiled by bad acting and sloppy camera work.Not a good movie at all. Do not waste your time."
tt3053228,".. that is to say, tastless rubbish. I love the horror genre, and especially the classics and those movies with fresh new ideas. This one? Sigh. It's formulaic, follows a standard character profile (the army guys, the cranky leader, the gormless younger brother, the driven med student/female love interest...) with predictable plot points throughout, and what must surely be the most stupid characters in the history of horror cinema. I mean, this goes way WAY beyond ""heard a noise in the dark basement, goes to investigate"" kind of stupid. And don't even get me started on the ultra cheesy ending... this movie really should come with vomit bags. Truly. When your entire storyline would have been negated by even one sensible/logical choice at some point, there's something very wrong. This stinker is best avoided; if you can't, then try to find the humour in it like some other reviewers did - that'll help you get through without tearing your hair out!"
tt3053228,"There is absolutely nothing new or interesting to be found in this budget zombie flick. The story is fine I guess, but the screenplay that tells that story isn't, it's full of poorly written characters in cliched situations full of worn out horror tropes that you've seen 100 times before and done 100 times better. The acting swings wildly between just OK, awkward, and completely terrible. Some of the actors deliver their lines as if punctuation is a foreign concept to them, there's no pauses or natural flow to the monotone words falling from their mouths. The lead actress does a few voiceovers throughout the film that are delivered so poorly that it sounded like she was reading them for the first time as they recorded her. When it comes to direction and camera work the action is your typical low budget handheld shaky cam style, it's functional, it does the job and that's about it. There's nothing special or inspired, no shots that make you sit up and take notice. Any young aspiring directors out there aren't going to be rushing out to copy this directors style, if you can call uninspired and forgettable a style. I will say that the practical zombie and gore effects are well done, though variety when it came to how things died would have been nice instead of just zombie death = headshot and human death = bite on neck from zombie.In the end this is a very mediocre horror film full of poorly written cliched characters portrayed by mostly terrible actors, the various situations they find themselves in have zero tension because the script is so uninspired and predictable that you always know what's coming next. If you're like me you'll be rooting for the zombies after the first 10 minutes. I give it 3/10 You don't need a lot of money to make a great zombie type flick, all you need is a good script and a passionate director with a vision, for proof of this go watch The Girl With All The Gifts or 28 Days Later that both had similar budgets to this movie."
tt3053228,"The acting, special effects and story was awesomely horrific. Couldn't stop watching though. Nothing better to do lol"
tt3053228,"It had original zombie and lots of gore, what's not to like."
tt3053228,"The movie is terrible, nothing in it is even decent, the characters suck, there ""story"" if you can call it that way is just not there, it's so bad it will make you wonder why does this even exist"
tt5117484,"Moral of the story, dont become something you're not just to impress others"
tt5117484,"Elitist, Racist, HORRIBLE story writing, AWFUL cinematography, in fact the ONLY thing this movie has going for it which keeps it out of the 1 star zone is a shockingly good CAST, who deserve BETTER than the DRIVEL they were presented! It makes me wonder if their agents even read the scripts at all before they signed their clients to it, or was blackmail involved?And as for any kind of storyline continuity or resolution for that matter, DON'T BOTHER watching it! The movie LITERALLY dumps you right at the climax and teaches both the main character and the audience NO LESSON! There's no outcome! As a bit of a videophile, I've NEVER seen ANYTHING like this! It leaves you where the movie started! HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!"
tt5117484,"One of worst movies I've ever watched. Just poor everything with this exception. The ending. From the last scene with the girl, his alter ego talking to dad, and his alter ego walking away from him an saying ""I've got work to do"". If ever there was a movie that needed a sequel it's this one. Does he somehow get the girl, how does dad take the frat news, and lastly what work does the alter ego need to do?
 I could sit through a sequel just to get these questions answered. Not for everyone I'm sure but I really hate movies that leave this much open to your imagination..."
tt5117484,The only good part about this entire movie is billy's roomate. The acting is better in middle school theater classes and the plot is overall garbage.Not to mention that the Greek life in the movie is completely fictionalized by including extreme racism and a weird fetish for money which isn't humorous at any point of the movie. The main character's development is just not interesting and by the end of you movie i'm just glad it is over. The netflix fast forward button is definitely helpful when watching this cancer so make sure to use it if you ever decide to put this on for torture.
tt5117484,"My girlfriend put this on because she was looking for 'Greek' and Netflix didn't have that. We only watched about a half hour of this because we realized that the misogynistic and racist and classist and homophobic jokes were actually real. There was nothing redeeming about this movie at all. The acting was for crap, nothing makes sense as it might in reality on our very round earth and I cannot stress enough how racist and cringe-worthy this is. Most notable scene is when a few white frat guys chase the first black guy who appeared in the movie outside of their house explaining why it's okay for them to call him the N word. The only logical explanation I can come up with as to why this movie was made is that I guess young nazi proud boys need something to watch while the rest of the world is actually engaging in inclusive, progressive thought. If your hobbies include chanting ""Jews will not replace us!"" with a tiki torch in your hand, this movie's for you!"
tt5117484,This movie always hits right. The scenes of the frat president chewing out his pledges are some of the funniest and sometimes most purposefully over the top scenes around. Never gets old
tt5117484,"This movie is a harsh satire of fraternity life, but while also being hilarious at moments. Anything with Billy and Adam is hysterical. Such an entertaining watch. My go-to on Prime."
tt5117484,"Looking at the trailer for this film I honestly kind of knew what to expect: gratuitous nudity, crude jokes and questionable acting. If I was to measure the success of the film based on my expectations, I would have to say it certainly delivered.I easily watched the movie from beginning to end with interest and was disappointed with the ending which I won't discuss here. One of the stronger points of the film is the acting of Justin Mark, who plays Billy Hawkins. He has an on-screen charisma and delivery that helps to carry some otherwise very awkwardly staged scenes. At times I wonder if he might have been better cast as the Nick Cooper character. The film follows a B movie formula in terms of its execution, and I think that's important to keep in mind when trying to appraise what we have here exactly. But even then, it does fall short. For example, it fails to adequately capture the energy and life of a college party at a frat house. In one scene, a bunch of girls are seated on the porch not really doing anything but maybe holding drinks. I can't help but wonder what a boring party that might be. As a student at Georgetown, walking down the street near campus, you can hear loud bumping music coming from any number of student houses. Failing to capture the essence of what it is to be a party, is just one of many failures. And that does make a difference, it makes one question the entire purpose of the film. The debauchery of college is about excess, in particular bacchanalian style binges.A good B movie goes too far, which is why it's a B movie. This movie doesn't go far enough and at the end it makes you wonder if you've gone anywhere at all. I think it's worth a watch, but approach it with an open mind."
tt5117484,"Okay, is Frat Star a plot-driven modern masterpiece of cinema? Not by most standards. However, the movie has far too many hilarious scenes and quotable lines to discard as a downright bad movie. The acting for every single supporting character was phenomenal without fail. Nick Cooper could've been a better protagonist with a better actor but all in all, the pervasive comedy of the movie was great. The film had its failings with attempts at drama but even then the drama had its comedic value at being so awkward. I would go so far as to say Frat Star is absolutely a must watch and many of the critic and user reviews of the movie take it too seriously. The movie doesn't necessarily push an intense underlying social commentary but it is a hilarious spoof on Greek life. The only aspect of the movie that leaves you utterly disappointed is the very ending but that doesn't take away from the sheer number of quotable one-liners and outrageous comedy scenes."
tt5117484,"Unlike many of the films that make up the modern corpus of cinema, this movie isn't so bad that it's good, it's so good that it's bad. On first viewing you will be disgusted with the depravity and bigotry depicted herein, but once the shock has settled you will be left uneasy by the surrealist pacing that this moviegoer can only imagine was intentional. On your second and third viewing, you will realize this film for the masterpiece it truly is. It is a greek tragedy, about greek life.At first the film passes quickly, and many lines feel like non-sequitors. As the plot sets in, and our protagonist adjusts to the rigid yet nonsensical structure of Greek life, the confusion settles and the pace becomes more regular. His descent into debauchery is absolutely Orphic, save for his failure to safely navigate an exit from the hell he has volunteered himself to. By the ending he is doomed to become a shade, the true specter of his innocent self.Justin Marks punctuates both chaotic and passive scenes with his frantic and frankly wonderful performance as the all-too-unbelieveable Billy Hawkins, a role for which I believe he should have received an award.Having given this wonderful film a due and proper consideration, I hereby award it two clenched fists in the air."
tt5117484,"First off before I start I will say this; I'm Chinese and this film was very racist, sexist, pigist, homophobicist & all the other "" ists"" out there that i missed lol but it was damn funny n done in funny ways & I loved the movie! This film was hilarious, though seems maybe low budget but overall It didnt bother me that much as the film progressed. Hot chicks, funny jokes & outrageous scenes like wow smoke a spliff n watch away lol .Also for anyone saying this film is too racist.. well you know...all racist & sexist comments they made about every race, colour, genders they actually didnt discriminate in the way that they tried too insult every race & gender so no one felt left out lmao, being Inclusional was on their agenda foreal lol.Lets be real here this is a comedy film & if you so easily butt hurt then why did you watch about Frat clubs ?? Did you all really think Frat Clubs are all peace & love & respect & not racist lol? Did you think all of the most powerful Frat organizations out there had upstanding & respectful members? Theirs a reason why the rich & powerful clique together in Frats cuz they dont want too associate with lower classes & they want too take advantage of each others future potential connections to enrich themselves n become powerful men In America. If u watched this film knowing its about Frats & Sex n u try to claim u had no idea it could be this offensive then you must have lived a sheltered life to be so innocent.Anyway, though they made racist remarks about the chinese character & Im chinese too but I found it funny cuz sure its offensive in the real world but when your watching a movie u should let loose n open your minds, I mean that part about when Chang asked something about if the outcome will be judged as a curve?; then the Frat guy says No! It will be judged on a Slant!! Omg that had me laughing hard lol. Comedians make fun of their own race n ethnicity & ppl will laugh but then when its said by a white person in a comedy film its like oh no! Thats offensive! If it was some white guy who walked by n said something racist I would put him down of course no questions asked, but its a comedy film so..ya its totally different.Lastly I will say everyone is racist in some way or degree whether u know it or not, its normal but people wanta act like they aint. Anyone to tell u they never been racist is a straight up lie, the only difference between everyone is which asshole acts full on racist & which are just alittle. From you not wanting your daughters to date black men, to see some country white guy n thinking hes a white hick, to you hating on someone cuz their mixed ethnicities & making jokes u thought were harmless by saying they cant speak their own language properly or they dont look either race cuz they mixed, or u thought white or asian ppl cant rap or you felt asian ppl cant be macho or be good basketball players, or you feeling this minority girl dates a white guy cuz shes after the money, or u just see a blonde white girl n u think shes a dumb blonde? Or u just thinking cuz hes asian that he has a small manhood, All of these might seem harmless or some may argue its not racist but the fact is that ur perceptions of them is because of their race & u believe them to be lesser in value cuz of their race & u believe that their race equates to them all being the same."
tt5117484,It was funny with a crazy twist at the end. Love to see more movies with connor lawrence in it
tt8923396,"Cinematography / location / visual effects & production : 8.5/10Acting : 4/10 most of the actors are really bad and cringey especially if you're jordanian and can understand the language and dialect , it feels like they used google translate sometimes. (the only worthy performance was by Aysha Shahaltough 'Vera' )It has a lot of unnecessary cursing as if they were told to add curses where ever they can, some of these words are extremely offending to some people, so by doing this they have alienated a huge proportion of the intended audience including teens.The only reason i'm giving it 5/10 is because the production was good."
tt8923396,"Although I was excited for the first arabic Netflix series, a Jordanian one that is, but it was very disappointing. I'm not even gonna talk about the false depiction because I'm sure that was never the point The dialog is unbelievably inorganic! Nobody talks like that in real life
The plot is good, but the script is so unjustifiably bad. Too bad it actually had potential."
tt8923396,"I am almost through episode 4, and the synchronization is without doubt the worst I have ever heard, but is nothing compared to the script, why are the kids acting like Americans? They are Jordanians, let them be that, let them reflect the amazing Jordanian culture. There is a good story there, but it has been done completely wrong. Netflix you failed here, and failed miserably."
tt8923396,"Really really REALLY bad acting, and the dialogue seems like it was translated from english using a very bad translating engine too,
Its not how we talk or think, it seems like a hybrid language between English and something (not even arabic).i think there was a lot of potential for the story but oh boy did they blew it.There is a lot of great actors in jordan but Netflix chose to get the rich kids from the fancy schools in amman instead.What a HUGE disappointment."
tt8923396,"Very bad story
Very bad script
Very bad actors
Not reflecting the true view of the community and not recommend to watch it."
tt8923396,"Having a local production was something that many were excited about and looking forward to seeing, but the series missed the mark completely.
The script was something a seventh grade high school student would come up with for their drama or English composition project. The music was not in any way relevant to the story or the scenes in the series.
The acting was simply childish but most of the blame should fall on the writer and not the actors themselves, it's all they had to work with, I guess.I could go on and on about why this was a terrible series and a waste of time frankly but this should suffice."
tt8923396,"The script is so weak and so bad, the acting on the other hand is just terrible, this is anything but acting."
tt8923396,One of the worst shows you can see lame story fail acting
tt8923396,"Jordon or Amman. Arent they Islamic countries? Why didnt have any hijabi girls???? We saw many series (for example Elite. Its an espanic)
Why directors didnt give us Arabic culture? They are giving just west culture. Wrong!"
tt8923396,"Maybe the cast thinks we want to hate on them or whatever, but seriously you should quit acting, The story disrespects religions, traditions and culture of Jordan, I'm so sad this happened to be the first Jordanian show on Netflix."
tt8923396,As a Arab that isn't Muslim I really enjoyed the show :) stop hating on the actors and let them have a good start.If your not close minded then you're going to enjoy the show 👍🏻
tt8923396,The series changed my perspective about genie which I had because of watching Disney's alladin. In this series they show us a different take on them in modern world. Where they are evil and provide wishes to set themself free by taking the body of the summoner. Kudos to Netflix and team for making such a great show. Waiting for season 2.Guess the kiss scene really triggered some people which caused the low rating I guess.
tt8923396,You should allow to put rate in negative for this movie... save your money
tt8923396,"It worth less than 1 star.
Story so bad, moreover, acting so bad."
tt8923396,"So i was excited when i heard there would be a Supernatural show based in my hometown, saw the trailer had some doubts, yet i gave it an honest chance. The Visuals were good, for a JINN show i thought there would be more VFX.The actors are so bad that they have no emotions and no range, dialogue is something from google translate, it does not portray how we talk or how we actually are, we look weak and scared, yet Jordanians are actually tougher, they don't portray the life in Jordan properly. Its a waste of 4 hours in my opinion, my friend actually acted in this, i watched it to support him as an actor, if you're thinking of watching it, just watch it to support it. NOTHING ELSE."
tt8923396,"Forget about weak acting
Forget about the cursing
The whole script is super weak and it is copied from many movies
The dialogue is also weak
Long story short
I have no idea how this was approved to go on Netflix"
tt8923396,"They brought a high quality camera to shoot with ,that is the only good thing in this movie"
tt8923396,"Really good production quality - actors could be better, but kudos for efforts!"
tt8923396,"I'm Arabic man and this series is look like American series not Arabic,"
tt8923396,"It was a loss of money and time, I have never seen as such as this, just trying to copy the Western community, pethetic"
tt8923396,"Let me explain something - this got many 1/10 ratings for 2 main reasons
1- The use of R-rated language in a Jordanian production which NEVER ever happened before, and Jordan is generally conservative and people are offended.
2- Many Arabs and Jordanians had very high expectations given that this is the first Netflix-produced production.
The dialogue is a direct translation from an English script which makes it a weak and irrelevant dialogue, and the actors sometimes act like amateurs, but it's a very good first step. I hope they accept some criticism but still produce a season 2."
tt8923396,"I will rate the move 5.5 out of 10..
As we arabs enjoy horror movies. Arabs horror move should be scary as its attached with our culture.
I wish Netflix complete the full parts of jian.with more scary actions"
tt8923396,I was so excited about this series ... after watching i regret each second of excitement i had
tt5456546,"Rating: NA Veteran actor Rishi Kapoor said that Bollywood makes garbage movie because film lovers don't want to watch good movies. This is partly true. Cine goers seek entertainment, not preaching documentaries. However Bollywood has always been best when it mixes entertainment with light moments and some lessons. Whenever such movies are made they work wonders. Judwaa 2 does not fall in that category. It is a typical pot boiler that takes Indian film industry and audience 20 years back to a senseless subject for over two hours and you are forced to move out before your head blasts. There was no point in making the remake of a typical comedy that makes you smile even today. With added loudness and overacting by the three leads, this movie is an indigestible Masala."
tt5456546,a guide on how to make a Bollywood movie.1) take a guy (who thinks he can act but in reality a goat can act better then him) he must be son of a director or an actor. 2) take some hot girls(acting skills not required coz no one gonna watch there acting anyway) 3) copy script from Hollywood or tollywood.4) take old songs n put some shitty music in it(lets call it remix) 5)make girls dance to those shitty songs in short skirts n let the guy show his abs.6)go to every accessible place on earth for promotion.7) cross your fingers and hope for stupid people to watch your movie.8)profit.
tt5456546,"Don't watch this really stupid movie, even if you get free tickets. Acting is pathetic, story is crap, the only thing good is Jaqueline Fernandez only because she looks good. If you have watched the first part, there is absolutely no difference just additional stupidity. There is unnecessary fight scenes and overacting. Even the jokes are not funny. Watch this movie if you want a free headache. Still recovering from mine."
tt5456546,"I thought the 90s were already over. Don't know why they choose to remake the movie and call it ""Judwaa 2"". Everything was same like the early movie ""Judwaa"" then what's the point in making remake. I think Bollywood is running out of story. They just copied everything don't know what to watch. Movie made me sick can't tell about acting also when all frames are cliché.If you know this is a remake you are old too. I could write better stories than this in my sleep. Call me Bollywood."
tt5456546,Varun dhawan doesn't know how to act still he tries... I don't know why This is so awful I don't understand why do opeople make such brainless films...it spoiled an iconic film like Judwaa with full on copy paste...with this film its clear that David dhawan has made it only for his son but the son of nepotism tried to copy salman by acting like Govinda...its name should Bhaadwa2 not Judwaa2 this film doesn't deserve the iconic tittle judwaa...wastage of money and time... Now give me my money back
tt5456546,I had a good luck with this because I haven't seen Judwaa 1 and the fact that max. of the movie is copied didn't bother me.The movie is entertaining and enjoyable. Varun Dhawan is the pillar that holds the movie and keeps you entertained.A good movie but nothing special.You will surely enjoy it if you haven't watched 1st part.
tt5456546,"dint understand why do Indian producers waste money on stupidity VD the actor seems like the most stupidest actor of Indian cinema 2017and to add this film , nothing compared to J 1just non sensible movie . all actors look desperate to shine but none did.i can just rate its time waste and 1 star"
tt5456546,I went to see this film when it came out and I really enjoyed it because of the cast and story line . I like David DHAWAN film a lot but found this one very funny and catching . The cast is very good and even though varun dhwan is my favorite actor and jaqueline fernadez and tapsi pannu is my favorite Actress I really enjoyed this comedy Romance film
tt5456546,"No logic, no story....Just nonsensical entertainment,few really laughable scenes,cliché action sequences,old yet enjoyable songs, fun-filled acting by the 2 actresses & an energy-packed performance(including over-acting) by Varun Dhawan sums up Judwaa 2 !! I knew the sort of movie I was going to watch so I enjoyed it thoroughly,apart from some boring portions. :) Having watched Judwaa previously, this one brought back some good old memories of it's predecessor, with certain scenes almost completely copy-pasted, including the dialogues.Varun has tried to pull this off extremely well and almost carries the entire movie on his own shoulders !! Some people might literally find the movie nothing less than a disaster....but if you know this kind of cinema,if the masala entertainers are your thing, you won't be that disappointed. Leave your brains at home & dance to the ""tan tana tan"" with the Dhawans, provided mindless entertainment amuses you."
tt5456546,"20 years back David Dhawan made the comic caper Judwaa, which was illogical, but still a light entertainer with rib-tickling comedy scenes and good performances. Push forward button to 2017, Judwaa 2, made by same director, same premise, same scenes and even same background, yet to fails to deliver.Judwaa 2 tells the story of twins who gets separated at their birth due to unusual circumstances and meet each other in their adulthood.Sometimes I wonder whether Bollywood prepares any script before directing any film. Spending so much on location, songs and dance would not give inception of a good film unless script is thoroughly worked upon. There is no definition of Story, Script and direction tin Judwaa 2. The main drama unfolds in the later reel which again is intolerable with screenplay written by a school kid. Editing is horrible. The torture goes on for almost 2.25 hours. Art direction is good. Cinematography is nice. Songs are tuneful (again all the songs. baring one, is lifted straight from the original. Dialogues are less-impacting. Performances are over- topOverall, a pathetic film in every sense. Poor- 1/5"
tt5456546,"Other than the awful script the only thing which is worse in the movie, is that you have to bear the awful overacting of VARUN DHAWAN....the only good thing about the movie was cameo of Salman khan and surely that say's a lot about the quality of the movie...wouldn't recommend it to even ISIS"
tt5456546,"There is nothing to special to write about this movie. Even if I write the most negative review, that will also be nothing in the honor of this movie. bad acting, bad direction. They din't even tried to create a new story with the concept of twins. Same old movie with new characters. Even songs are same. Pathetic. And that pathetic acting by that so called actor Varun Dhawan. Nepotism sucks. Tapsee Pannu ready to ruin her career from this bad movie. Stay away from this movie. Or the choice is yours. Your money your time."
tt5456546,":D I am not able to find minus rating , and this movie does not deserve even 1 rating ..it's unfair for this movie and Varun Dhawan . Please add minus rating so we viewers can give - rating to these type of great movies ."
tt5456546,"Trying to create the same magic after 20 years, David Dhawan makes a disaster known as Judwaa 2 which stars his son Varun Dhawan in a double role.David Dhawan directing a film after 3 years and that too a remake of one of his own films which was a hit in 1997 seemed to be exciting before it's release but eventually it lands up becoming a mindless entertainer.Sachin Khedekar who plays the role of a father of twin sons who helps the police to catch a smuggler, gets in trouble when that smuggler takes one of his twin and keeps him on the railway track. But that child is saved as his brother turns on the right side and as they both have a reflex action the one on the railway track also turns. I laughed sarcastically at this scene and this same continues throughout the film and makes me get irritated.The twins Raja and Prem are played by Varun Dhawan, his performance is like a toothache. Varun has delivered the same performance which was in Main Tera Hero. Varun's SRK mimicry is also preposterous. Screenwiter Yunus Sajawal has written a horrible screenplay, which should be avoided these days. Actually I can't get it that even after 20 years, such kind of screenplays are written and are also accepted. The dialogues are penned by Sajid - Farhad which are partially funny, the dialogues like ""Ammi jaan kaha karti thi....."", are contempt. Thus by writing such screenplays and creating no logic makes the Indian audience's mentality the same as it was 20 years before. If I take a film like The Terminator (1984) as an example, that was written and directed by Cameron and was really nice. But in 2009 he made Avatar which was also good but better than his previous films. That happened because he didn't try to create the same magic. Over here the writers have written the same cliché screenplay and the director has directed in the same manner which makes me bored. In one of the scenes while diffusing a bomb Raja says that he should cut the red wire as red was lucky for him. This scene makes me completely baffled and later becomes terribly annoying. Thus the screenplay and direction lacks innovation. Something that I liked in the film is Ayananka Bose's cinematography, which is top-notch. The frames are really impressive. Also the editing goes well. I really don't get one thing that what are actors like Pavan Malhotra and Sachin Khedekar doing in such a film? Such great actors in such a film! I really didn't like it.Comprehensively, this cynical film has a lot of funny scenes that make you laugh for no reason as it's a film which makes no sense. I'm going with one out of five stars.RATING: 1/5"
tt5456546,"Judwa 2 – is a film about twins separated at birth. One reaches the slums of Versova and the other reaches the plush bungalow of his parents in London! One becomes an illiterate, tapori (brash) kind of person – happily singing, dancing and flirting with any female he sets his eyes on and the other is suave, sophisticated and gentle.The above makes one wonder about the elaborate astrological charts that get generated for individuals! How on earth the twins had such a drastically different astral configuration.they both had exactly the same time, date, place even minute of birthyet both had such different lifestyles!So does it mean Karmas override Horoscope? Maybe the two different souls had different set of karmas and hence one reached the slums and the other reached the bungalow!Second observation – Indian cinema use females as fillers to give cheap thrills to we, the people! Both the young and attractive heroines were made to wear scanty panties and asked to jump high and low so that the viewers catch a glimpse of their chaddies! Period. And then they showed that a filthy rich daughter of a mall owner went all dizzy up on being kissed by the slum dweller of Versova! This has been shown in many films by the way! As far as I remember – in Betaab – Sunny Deol kissed unruly Amrita, In Hum Dil de chuke Sanam, Ajay Devgan kissed Aishwaryaand many more such films.and mind you that becomes the turning point in the heroin's life! She becomes totally smitten – dhili-dhali – silly pilly after being smooched! Ridiculous! In real life such an incident will usually call for a lot of trouble for the male – in Kolkata, better not try these stunts or you would be beaten publicly!Anyway, so basically often it is shown in Hindi films that a filthy rich girl falls for a rustic beggar!Such concepts raise the expectations of the poor slum dwellers and such smarties start singing and eve teasing ordinary family girls thinking that if filthy rich female in the film could fall for a slum dweller, why wouldn't some middle class family girl fall for me!? And when nothing of this sort happens, we hear cases of acid bombs and rapes and murders! Kiss trends in Hindi CinemaWhatever little understanding I have of this world, I think the richer you are, the more heightened and refined would be your tastesI really don't understand why Bollywood shows such concepts of utter mismatch! Even in the film ' Jab Harry Met Sejal' – the diamond merchant's daughter sticks to a tour guide.gets overly pally with him and even performs like a raunchy pole dancer to impress him!! How stupid can that be!Third observation: Charles, the criminal, had a very loyal and faithful group of people working for him! Wonder what kind of counselling or incentives these criminals give that their employees stick to them like glue! Need to learn such things from criminals!"
tt5456546,"*This movie is a Ctrl C + Ctrl V of the classic Judwaa.* Varun Dhawan proves to be an annoying on screen presence while his so loving dad (David Dhawan) centers the whole movie on his son. I feel sorry, but I can't stop myself from taking crap about this film, because it is CRAP, and so I'll save my energy and another dose of mental illness trying to recall this movie."
tt5456546,"Very good, awesome majedaar movie.
I think old people who have watched judwaa 1 doesn't found it interesting but I loved this movie. Nice acting by my lovely Tapsi pannu nd mah bro Varun Dhawan."
tt5456546,"For starters the locations were chosen well and are a good appetizer.When I wrote this review there were hardly any votes and the rating was 3.7. Well, it is definitely an above 6 for me, and for some funny scenes it jumped just over 6.5, so I could give it a 7. I don't regularly watch Hindi movies, but I have seen good ones and bad ones. This one was more towards the refreshing ones.It got all the needed distractions like the BMX chase, some roof and street jumping, so it never really got boring. Some nice action scenes which could have done with a bit less violence. So please do not take your one and two year olds like the guys next to me in the cinema.The main actor, Varun Dhawan did a solid job, playing these two different characters, Jaqueline Fernandez seemed to enjoy the dance lessons before and was in sync with Varun, and Tapsee Pannu, well, she is just gorgeous.All together a nice comedy with some sidekicks to other movies like Three Idiots. I enjoyed it. I tend not to over analyze movies."
tt5456546,"Poorest in all categories. Weakest acting, poor direction, no screenplay, no story, bad music mix and there is nothing at all to it.
Hoped for some really great comedy of the year from super hit comedy director ""David Dhawan"", but he fails in all areas.Director just ruined the classic super hit Original Judwa with Salman Khan. I am more disappointed about that actually. Original judwa was and still is fantastic flick to watch but this remake/sequel ruined not only itself but the original one.May be one day these comedy makers would reLearn how to make a comedy, not giving hope on that so far."
tt3991302,"I remember when Gary Daniels was a rising star in the B movie industry in the 1990s. Since that period, I've hardly seen him in any movies at all, though he's kept working steadily. When I found this particular effort of his on Netflix, I decided to give it a look to see how he's been doing lately. Though judged from this movie, it doesn't seem like he's doing very well. I realize that Daniels is now in his early 50s, an age where it's harder for a martial arts actor to find quality projects, but he surely could have done better than this ultra low budget Mexican effort. It is a really crudely made exercise, with really bad cinematography and rock bottom production values. The script is even worse, with important scenes or linking footage missing, leading to a garbled story. Also, the so-called twists in the story will be no surprise to any viewer. As for the action, the martial art sequences are mediocre at best, and flat at their worst. The gunplay scenes are even worse. You'd be much better off looking in thrift stores for copies of Daniels' 1990 efforts instead of this absolutely pathetic effort."
tt3991302,Gary Daniels was a great fighter in the day and at 57 he's in excellent shape still but the fight choreography in this film is shockingly bad. Very slow and obviously choreographed. Acting is somewhat plastic. Daniels would be more suited to more credible fight choreographers for his fights and also bigger directors . Can't recommend this sadly.
tt3991302,"Unless you count it as a surprise that the previews 3 reviews of this movie claim to have spoilers. Only read one of them from someone who seems to be a fan of Gary Daniels. And if you are of a certain age, you may have seen some of his movies too. You may also be wondering why he didn't become bigger. Then again, you may also realize that he probably made a lot of bad decisions.This movie is one of them. While it may have read nice on paper, this seems to come straight out of the mind of a 6 year old. Don't get me wrong, kids do have great ideas too obviously. This is not one of those cases. The script is riddled with inconsistencies, the acting if you can call it that is below average at best (with Daniels being the top dog) and an overall tension span that is so weak you may fall asleep ... Action scenes are ok if you are being kind ... and haven't seen any martial arts movie in the last decade.Obviously this all also boils down to budget and maybe the director may have more to offer. In this case though I highly and strongly recommend not watching this"
tt3991302,"Nicely directed,no shaky cam,well edited.
Simple story to follow, nothing new, decent action cheography, Gary daniels has still got it and does well in the lead aswell as the action scenes. Supporting actors all do fine, just lacking budget which is a shame could have been better.Overall a decent action film and for die hard gary daniels fans."
tt0111780,"Inspector Shanker Verma is an honest and dedicated Police Inspector, who has been serving on the police force for many years. He lives with his mom, and a brother, Jai. Shankar was in love with Shashi, but the affair did not last, leaving him with a broken heart. Jai, on the other hand, is precocious, and always in trouble. This precociousness lands him in a soup when he is unable to explain as to why he robbed a bank and a killed a person.This is a stylish movie that is very watchable with a caveat.The violence is decidedly G rated. Guns don't really fire. You just hear sound effects of shots.And people die, but there is no blood. Guess that's It's a fun fast moving film."
tt0111780,"Yaar gaddar is a suspense action thriller well directed by veteran umesh mehra . The movie released in 1994. The script is tight. It keeps the audience engaged. Sequences are well weaved. The 2nd part of the film, when mithun receives Sheila's case file and delivers dialogues is the most important part of the film. There's the suspense hidden. And mithun da in just one monologue proves his mettle as an actor. All actors are convincing. But the performance to watch is of veteran actor umesh shukla. He does the role of shiela and governor with equal ease. He's brilliant in both roles. Both roles look completely different, spontaneous and convincing. The aspect of split personality is well handled in the character shiela and governor. Umesh shukla is the main attraction of the film. Umesh shukla's potrayal of shiela and governor is equal to other iconic villain roles of bollywood. I wonder why didn't umesh shukla do more roles of various genre in different hindi movies...! Anyway yaar gaddar is must watch for suspense lovers.Once again hats off to umesh shukla."
tt0111780,"Umesh Mehra's 1994 flick 'Yaar Gaddar' is an interesting watch, The film has pluses and minuses. Pluses: The film has an interesting plot, Good music lovely songs and good performances. Minuses: The film's climax is a letdown, and the comedy track is a yawn. All n all 'Yaar Gaddar' deserves a one time watch! Performances: Mithun Chakraborty is an excellent actor and he's amazing in this film too. Saif Ali Khan impresses. The Chemistry between Mithun and Saif works big time. Somy Ali is good. Saif's heroine is decent. Prem Chopra, Gulshan Grover, Puneet Issar and Anjana Mumtaz are good. Johnny Lever's comedy track is bland. The actor who plays the role of the villain is okay.Yaar Gaddar is an above-average entertainer, watch it if you've got nothing to do in a plain day."
tt11276598,"First off, movies have ratings for a reason...TV-Y7 means its not really meant for kids under 7. So all these posts about hiw this movie isn't suitable for their 2 year old..well duh...it says its not. Anyways, on to the movie...its a decent story with decent acting. It could be better but, I have seen far worse. It has a good lesson for kids about not judging others. Give it a try.. I mean..its not like you can't stop it and put something else on."
tt11276598,"These reviews are hillarious - Most adults hate kids stuff anyway but kids love this stuff, you know pets and robots what could go wrong? most western 13 yr olds are stuck playing GTA 5 or fortnite instead of reading so
5/10 stars because hey it keeps the kids busy for an hour and a half i guess."
tt11276598,"The animation is decent, the story is ok, I agree its not pushing any boundaries, but its far from the worst animated film I've ever seen. I may be slightly biased as my two year old has watched every day, sometimes up to 3 times a day since its been on Netflix, she loves it."
tt11276598,"This movie is just awful. Like, not offensive or anything. Theres nothing in there i would not want my kids to see. Its just bad. It feels like somebody fed the twenty most popular kids movies on Netflix to a computer and asked an algorithm to write a script. Then it was edited and retold by my five year old. And then the voice acting was done by whoever was available at the local community college. Cliche tropes is one thing, but this one is done with no charm, character, emotion, nothing. The story is somehow both standard cliche tropes AND makes no sense. The pacing is slow so there is no excitement, the characters are flat so you really dont care about anything one way or another.Its just plain bad."
tt11276598,"This movie has absolutely no redeeming moments. No good parts, the most boring and useless hour and a half you'll ever spend. Watching paint dry or grass grow would be a better use of time. What Rodger leaves in front of the door to distract the robot doorman sums this movie up exactly."
tt11276598,"Well all I can say is this is one of the worst animations I have seen in a long time.To begin with the voice actors have no other emotion other than read as if they reading a book or maybe they thought they were all the robots. How they got Natalie dormer to sign on I don't know, she must have just been killed off on thrones and thought she wouldn't have got another job like all the other deaths off that show. Don't even get me started with the Ronaldo character and his voice that is just ridiculous.Then the actual animation itself is pretty poor and would expect this as an early 2000 cartoon film.As for the story that is just ridiculous, the story boarding meeting must have been a free for all, they must have gone we like secret life of pets, wall-e, big hero 6 and bolt and then I am legend and thrown it all together and well it is just a big mess.The song with the crocodile, tiger and hyena has to be said is awful.If you can don't bother watching this with your kids as it is no fun nor entertaining."
tt11276598,"As the mother of an 8-year-old, I've watched a lot of bad animated movies in the past 18 months of the pandemic. This is easily the worst I have ever had to sit through.The animation is worse than you get on cheaply-produced half-hour tv shows; the plotline is alternately incomprehensible and stupid; half of it seemed like just borrowed tropes from other, more successful films that were shoehorned together; and the editing is just bizarre.In almost all the scenes, the animals are walking abnormally slowly - you end up feeling like the production guys said ""Guys. This thing is only 72 minutes but we promised the distribution company we'd get them at least 115 minutes of content. You gotta add 40 minutes, stat!"" There are weird, lengthy reaction shots (seriously, there is nothing weirder than watching 10 whole seconds of reaction shots between badly-animated animals, especially when there's literally no reason).Anyway, the next time your kid asks you to watch a movie with them, I promise that watching Frozen II for the 11th time will be better than even 10 minutes of this disaster."
tt11276598,Not sure why this was made...graphics are good...story is truly awful
tt11276598,It's just bad. The dialog is forced. Voice acting is terrible. Story is worse.
tt11276598,My son is 3 and loves this movies we have been watching on repeat for days
tt11276598,"It kept the kids quiet for 1h29mins
. Who cares about the plot dialogue etc. its all about keeping the kids busy while you drink 😉"
tt11276598,The worst animation I've seen in a long time. Story line is rubbish. Voice actors really didn't try.
tt11276598,"Something obviously went very, very, very wrong during the making of this computer animated movie. The only theory I have that might explain its general failure to entertain is the fact that it was a co-production between three very different countries - China, Germany, and the UK. With three different cultures working on the same project, it seems that it couldn't be fine tuned to be satisfying to one (or any) culture.The movie fails in two big ways. First, there is the script. It is an utter mess. There are many things that are not explained, character development is usually near zero, and there is obvious padding. The second misstep is that it is directed in a manner that is pretty much free of passion and enthusiasm. Things plod along EXTREMELY slowly, and when there is a scene of action or suspense, the movie is remarkably casual and unexciting. Even the music score throughout is held back so much that you hardly register it in your mind.In fairness to the movie, I will admit that I wasn't unsatisfied by its visual presentation. While the movie didn't have a Hollywood budget, the movie looks fairly colorful and detailed. But even with an acceptable look, the rest of the movie is so tiresome and badly handled that it was a real struggle for me to watch the movie completely to the end. I think even young children will get some sort of feeling that the movie is being held back in many key areas, so even they should not be subjected to watching it."
tt11276598,The entire plot could be explained in a few sentences. It should really be a 5-10 minute animated short and even then it would be unimaginative.The animation looks good in stills but in motion it's awful. The editing is just bad. Nothing feels smooth or natural. None of the dialogue is interesting at all.If I gave netflix budget animation tools to your average high school level writers and designers you would get this movie. Even then I would give them a C-.
tt11276598,"For me to stop and review something? It's preventing others from wasting precious time.Premise is rock bottom - I mean so empty that I'm questioning a cartoon.Pets, with their people, live in a robot town. That's it. That's the whole thing. Why?My 4 year-old daughter will watch YouTube all day long. It could be Russians doing Frozen. It could be Elsa in German. It could be rich kids opening toys. I can watch some of those.It's like someone in Europe randomly chose several Youtube videos, added some Tom and Jerry, put them in a mixer and shook them up.I feel like the movie should have a disclaimer at the end (didn't get that far), ""If you like this movie, you were not paying attention."""
tt11276598,Waste of time and money. Unites all popular topics in one whole unlogical and boring film. Pets animations moves lack reality and consistency. Film full of senseless brutality and cheap humor. I don't recommend it.
tt11276598,"All have been said I'm all other reviews. This movie is terrible , I mean crazy bad. No new ideas , no excitement, my kids are bored like watching a closed tv, and I guess there are more excitement on a dark screen than this movie.If you saw no animation movie from the past decade you might find kind of interesting ideas, but theses are all stolen from real great movies.Dont waist your time."
tt11276598,"My son watched the whole thing without distraction, he loved and didn't keep popping up for other stuff. The bit I saw was fine. Not sure why all the horrible reviews"
tt11276598,"From start to finish this animation drags out every cliche with the least dynamic musical score I have ever heard. There is actually no story at all, just a pointless sequence of vacuous scenes that repeat over and over again. My son didn't laugh once or show any emotion whatsoever. I will never get that time back. It wasted our precious friday cinema night. Avoid completely."
tt11276598,"The dialogues, seperate scenes, storyline and 'message' are all terribly on the nose. There's very few genuine moments or emotions.There's nothing new or remotely exciting about the whole thing. And the cherry on top for me was the propaganda for keeping big cats in cages in zoos. Joe Exotic, was this you?"
tt11276598,"This film is so terrible, I just don't know where to start. Its a bit like some home made youtube animation thats been made feature length. The kids gave up quite quickly. I was getting increasingly annoyed that something this bad somehow was released publicly, but thankfully the kids turned it off!"
tt9817760,"A title like Jai Mummy Di makes you curious and interested in the movie instantly. Some stories are only interesting to read but not cut out for cinematic adaptations. That's the problem with this film. The subject material comes across as a hollow attempt. The screenplay tries to pack too much stuff, but how everything is spread out on the table makes you squirm in your seat. Seriously, one wonders after a point, what was the writer/director trying to say? The writing is not merely humdrum and dreary, but also amateurish at the same time. Things are presented in such an amateurish manner that it fails to cut ice. Even the culmination is so filmy. It's a screenplay of convenience!When it comes to escapist cinema, a gifted writer can make his imagination run wild. Think of a crazy story, come up with outrageous and zany situations, rope in actors who'd look believable in those parts... hey presto, a crazy potboiler is ready to be served. But Navjot Gulati's writing is plain mediocre. Besides, the second hour is lengthy, it gets tedious. After a point, the writing doesn't spring any surprises. You know exactly what's in store next and that's what bogs the film down. It also tends to get a little melodramatic and overemphasized intermittently. But the dialogues are smart and in sync with the mood of the film.Sure, Jai Mummy Di remains faithful to the ongoing trend of providing laughs at the oddest of things, but it's more of a masala fare that's reminiscent of the 1980s cinema. Packaged in a modern avatar, of course. More specifically, the writing relies on the age-old stuff to reach the finale. Too many cinematic liberties have been undertaken and it doesn't work at times. Agreed, you don't look for logic and reason in hardcore potboilers, but the least the writer/director (Navjot Gulati) could do is provide loads of entertainment. Sadly, he makes mincemeat of a plot that had the potential to woo viewers. On face-value, what do you expect from Jai Mummy Di? Laughter unlimited. But what's served on the platter is so insipid and lame. The comic scenes (that make you laugh) are few and far between.Directorially, Navjot Gulati goes horribly wrong. Saddled with a poor screenplay, there's not much that the director can do to salvage the show. The songs are plain ordinary. Sanket Shah's cinematography lacks the picture-perfect look. Hitesh Sonik's background score is loud to a greater extent than necessary.Sunny Singh is getting stereotyped. He looks ill at ease at places. Sonnalli Seygall is sincere, enacting her part with utmost conviction. The drama gets a little amusing thanks to Supriya Pathak, Poonam Dhillon and Danish Husain. It is difficult to imagine another pair of actors pulling it off as well. Supriya Pathak plays to the gallery. Poonam Dhillon is superb. Danish Husain is fantastic.On the whole, Jai Mummy Di just doesn't work. Flop!"
tt9817760,"Apart from the observation about the pointlessness of making a film like Jai Mummy Di (Let Mummy Triumph) which is a rehash of all romantic comedies you have seen in Bollywood centering on arranged marriages previously, what stands out is the contrived plot. It involves two mothers (who were former college friends) who have gigantic hatred for each other now and which prevents their kids (the characters of Sunny Singh and Sonnalli Seygall) from taking their relationship to the next step. Although there is some comedy here and there, it was annoying to watch the mothers (Supriya Pathak and Poonam Dhillon) fight baselessly throughout the film, with none of their supposedly chafing remarks landing. It becomes too much of a stretch by the final act, by what time you are already bored to death. Not something you should spend your 90 minutes on. TN."
tt9817760,"Comedy is a serious business. Indeed, everyone is not just a matter of comedy. If you did not mold the characters in the story in a comic manner, then you failed to make me laugh. The same has happened in director Navjot Gulati's 'Jai Mummy Di.' The film may be of comedy corner, but in the movie, you have fewer moments of laughter and more glimpses of superficial and force humor.The problem of director Navjot's direction is that he has chosen a skinny line story, which he could not elaborate. That is why nothing happens until the Interval. The story moves at a plodding pace. There are some funny one-liners in the film, but they do not hold much.The story moves a bit after Interval, but the irrational and childish scenes do not take the movie to any conclusion.When the reason for Pinkie and Lali's enmity opens in the Climax, there is a feeling of being cheated as a viewer. The glut of songs in the film creates hindrance rather than complementing the story.Sunny Singh, as Puneet Khanna, has tried his best to create an impact on his character. Sonali is glamorous as Saanjha but has not been able to catch the right tone of her role. Sunny and Sonali were earlier seen in 'Pyaar Ka Panchnama 2', but the chemistry between the two is missing here. Poonam Dhillon and Supriya Pathak have been given the titles of Mogambo and Gabbar in the film, but nothing like that appears in their characters. These two actors surely deserved more. Dhillon and Pathak, are sadly let down by the script. The experience of these two actresses is reflected in their performance, but due to loud and melodrama, they do not remain effective."
tt9817760,#JaiMummyDi is the story of two warring mothers - but their kids fall in love n complications arise - why exactly r the mothers fighting like morons - u need a lot of patience to wait till the end n find out - the climax is absurd - the music is atrocious - performances r irritating - running time needs to be reduced by 25 minutes - avoidable - rating 1/5.
tt9817760,I absolutely hated the movie at the end coz there was no strong reason that the mummy's in this movie are fighting about and the story is dragged so so much there are too many flaws and completely predictable story waste of time
tt9817760,"Horrible acting and stupid story writing
No expression and bogus dialogues"
tt9817760,Totally dumb comedy. Time pass. Couldnt have been worse.
tt9817760,"Again another movie based on Delhi style of wedding with stupidity and more stupidity and then extreme stupidity.
I stopped watching movie after 30 min. I guess even that was too much to waste.
The movie has no plot, no idea, no story, no acting , forced comedy ( its yuk anyways) and another name added in crap getting produced in India.
Advice : Kindly do not think to even watch. There is nothing to write about it."
tt9817760,I don't understand the ratings and reviews. Some films are just meant to be timepass and this film is like that. Very light film with no over emotional lines and mood. I liked the film throughout and actually laughed at some points and overall a film.is a good watch.
tt9817760,"Who the hell made her acting , she cant act !! And the film is so stupid there is no comedy at all , i wish they gave the role to another actress who can actually act , maybe it will be better movie if they didnt chose her ."
tt9817760,A fun watch for family and friends. Mummies are the best. Waiting for the sequel too.
tt9817760,The concept is familiar with Romeo and Juliet except there no war or anything just a modern desi era where the enmity is with the lover's mothers and not the society. This is a comedy film but there really wasn't much humor as expected with the story being pretty vague. Just a time pass kind of film overall.
tt9817760,"Pathetic ,waste of time, useless, no comedy.
Pathetic ,waste of time, useless, no comedy
Pathetic ,waste of time, useless, no comedy"
tt9817760,"Concept was interesting and start of the movie was good. But as time passes, the story & direction loosens its grip with lots of unbelievable flaws. How can directors consider their audience so dumb while creating such mindless movies. End was hopeless."
tt9817760,"Some would say this movie is meant to be a light hearted comedy. Well, that does not mean you create a movie with no plot, no real flow or sense at all. Comedies are the best genre out there (at least for me) and this one just does not make the cut. A story thats going in circles with nothing really great to say. Don't waste your time with this one."
tt9817760,This is a typical Bollywood rom com. Having said that its understood that the movie has a very non hysterical plot and will not offer anything fresh. This movie will give you some moments of uncontrollable laughter and is filled with double meaning jokes. I would see this movie if its the last comedy left in the universe other than that its a complete time wastage with old nonsensical plot. I would rate it 5/10.
tt9817760,"At the beginning, the film did appear promising - the opening song and dancing was enjoyable and resembled a typical Bollywood film. The aesthetics were beautiful. The plot did sound somewhat promising - particularly the conflict between the mothers.However, over time, the film became a bit odd. There were some plot holes - for example, we never met Irene or fully understood what the tension was between the two mothers. There were a lot of scenes that were quite random and a lot of random characters which did make it hard to follow. The ending was random (e.g. the Lamborghini song) and disappointing as it did not answer several questions I had.The chemistry between the couple (Saanjh and Puneet) seemed a bit awkward and not particularly convincing at times.
It would have been nice to have seen more of the rest of the families, such as the mothers - especially because the title did make me assume they would be central to the movie. Also, it would have been nice to have seen more of the other characters such as the family members as I found those scenes more enjoyable and funnier to watch.Overall, the film is cliché and decent to watch when you're bored and it is quite funny. However, with some improvements it could have been a lot better to watch."
tt9817760,Waste of time to watch. Song was good in this fim but not a good story.
tt9817760,We all love our Mummies and this movie is just about that but with a funny take! Two youngster hopelessly in love trying to convince their warring moms to let them get married and a rollercoaster of hilarious situations that takes place during the journey is all what this movie is about! Worth a watch!
tt9817760,"You should avoid this film because it lacks a proper storey line and has poor direction. Although there are a few good actors, they irritate you. And the songs in the movie doesn't make sense."
tt9817760,"Weak Screenplay, Poor Direction with no punch lines in Humor is what I concluded after watching this movie. Luv Ranjan being producer of the movie surely misses this time to connect with its audience. Supriya Pathak and Ponam Dhillon both seasoned actresses were wasted with respect to their character development and repetitive monotonous dialogues which also can be said for sunny Singh as he is now doing such roles from quite a few time to which I would say that he needs to diversify his roles as actor posses a lot of potential"
tt9817760,Movie is funny and nice although the directing could have been better..
tt11792734,"The name Ezel Akay (Ezop), takes place on the top lines of creative cinema lists thanks to his muchly peculiar cinematic langue. Most of his movies have been treated as examples of golden works in Turkey Cinema by many authorities.But unfortunately this last movie is too far off meeting any audience expectation based on Ezel Akay cinematography.Although the movie evokes the cinematic grammar of ""Neredesin Firuze"" (one of Akay's previous successfull works) it fails to catch an adequate dynamic mood which Neredesin Firuze significantly staged and 9 Kere Leyla tries to perform.-. Inadequate links between mythological significations and political discourse and-. Failing repetitive jokes which dominate and vanish sub-contentscould be counted as main major problems."
tt11792734,A movie that excited the cast but disappointed with its content
tt11792734,Two powerful actors Haluk Bilginer and Demet Akbag are spoiled in this so-called comedy. The film does not fit to any genre but just can be defined as nonsense.
tt11792734,"This movie is a complete disaster, true dissappointment."
tt11792734,"Ben boyle rezil bir senaryo gormedim. Haluk BILGINER disinda tam bir vakit kaybi. Turk yapimlari adina da bir utanc kaynagi.I have never seen such an outrageous script. Except for Haluk BILGINER, it's a complete waste of time. It is also a source of shame for Turkish productions."
tt11792734,"He is one of most appreciated actor for me, also Demet Akbag... I finished the movie for them... unfortunately i'm so disappointed too much in this movie... Maybe, I excepted too much after haven seen their names...
I love them, so, why I've given 2 ""stars"" ..."
tt11792734,"As an actor and actress Haluk Bilginer and Demet Akbag are the pioneer stars of their genres in Turkey. Ezel Akay unfortunately
legated their worst job at the same time both of them. I sensed that he couldn't tie the script up as an all. All the crew in movie probably trusted him. It was a a shame for filmographic past who has a past like Ezel."
tt11792734,"It is not usual but not bad!
I liked it specially musical parts👍😀"
tt11792734,"I don't consider myself a pro on Turkish cinema although I've seen many. However this was by far the worst thing I've ever watched in my entire life (I am 50 by the way)
Neither acting nor casting has least to say.
Hence, it was ""eye-burning!""
I'd strongly recommend to turn the source off if you coincide with it."
tt11792734,"I hadn't had an idea about the people's thoughts and comments on the movie until I finished watching it. When I saw the low rates, I got surprised. What do people expect from an absurd comedy? I liked the acting, the characters, mythological elements. It was good for me to escape from the reality."
tt11792734,"It is a film which had been lynched in turkish way. It is watched even only performers. When u watch it, you will see that it has been wronged by turkish users."
tt11792734,We could complete to watch the movie in 3 different times. It was hard.
tt11792734,"WASTE OF TIME.
ONE OF THE WORST FILM EVER.
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."
tt11792734,Waste of time and disappointing. Haluk Bilginer shouldnt have been in this movie
tt11792734,We are faced with the worst movie in Turkish cinema history. I can't imagine how a magnificent actress like Demet Akbag was persuaded to take part in such a bad production.
tt11792734,"I held my expectations high when I saw the cast, but so very disappointed. No plot, no comedy, no quality just exaggerated characters just as you would see in a cheap TV series.
Not recommended and very disappointed for Haluk Bilginer after a masterpiece such as Persona."
tt11792734,"The auction scene in the start summarizes the purpose of this film: ""to create a budget for a remarkable cinema. "" This can only be the explanation wasting our time..."
tt11792734,"I enjoyed the movie. Acting was great! I loved the atmosphere and the world that was created for the movie using paintings, art objects, vibrant-feminine colors...etc.
Usually I don't like direct, didactic messages in the movies. This movie has some through the end which may be unnecessary...
The music and singing was not great.
But, overall it's a fair movie that deserves attention!"
tt11792734,"This movie is a failed attempt to create a warm and entertaining atmosphere with many shades of orange. The way the scenes follow one another makes you feel exhausted by the time the movie ends.
I would gladly watch a two-hour movie in which Haluk Bilginer and Demet Akbag would just sit and talk across a table with a Galata view on the background. Any point for the conversation would do because both of them are so talented and experienced that only recording them with a smart phone camera (even recording vertically) while they are chatting would do fine for most viewers."
tt11792734,"It's not as bad as they made it to be. Movie has its' unique style of telling it. It was good nevertheless. I can see how Turkish people might have missed the deeper meanings, the fun in the way the story was told etc... Just keepin it short. I think it's worth watching plus it's at least 7/10. The story is good too. Makes you think and also gives out some strong messages throughout which are especially should be given at this point in Turkey."
tt11792734,"It was a movie that tried to be extraordinary. We watched it without getting bored and had fun, but still it doesn't appeal to everyone
A better movie could come out of this cast."
tt11792734,"I tried to tolerate and finish it but every 10 minutes it is repeating itself. So I quit at the middleNo fun, musical like scenes are so bad at some point you suprised how bad they were.I come here to warn people not to waste time."
tt11792734,The reason i gave 1 star is that the movie is really bad there are 9 musical things in total and that is a lot for a movie the players are good but when it comes to movie yolu don't want to watch it yok watch 10-20 minutes and pow a music comes out of nowhere
tt11792734,"A movie enjoyed with mythological and philosophical references and cleverly placed details.The film tries to answer the question of why men kill women.Is it because she doesn't love him, because she loves him, because she loves someone else?This is a story that goes back to the creation of man and woman, which is the beginning of everything.What lilith (leyla) says; We were created from the same clay as Adam.It is emphasized that masculinity is not a matter of gender but a matter of mentality, referring to patriarchy. Otherwise, there is no distinction between the human sex as masculinity and femininity, they were created equal. The fact that one of the men who came across Adam after he passed out is a 'man in wife', the sister of Khidr always shows us the indifference between male and female."
tt6370626,"I am not entirely sure why Netflix took on this show. I almost hope they did this as a joke to show how ridiculous ""MAGCON"" really is. The group is essentially made up of slightly above-average looking children who take advantage of the fact that millions of impressionable pre-teen girls around the world are willing to pay just to be in their presence. The fact that they even take themselves seriously is almost humorous, and whenever the camera cuts to interview each of the boys individually, the things they say are so unintelligent and illogical that it's laughable at times. These boys have no idea how to carry themselves professionally, the one kid Taylor is an ego maniac, and the others are just kind of in the background. They call themselves the ""talent"" but I'm really not entirely sure what talent any of them have other than jumping around on stage while girls scream. I'm not sure how the CEO Bart came into the picture, but he seems like a weirdo who preys on teenage boys' daddy issues. These kids live in a dream world, and this show was essentially just a way to promote themselves even further. Pretty addicting to watch, though, it's interesting to see what these kids view as reality and how preposterous it is."
tt6370626,"At first I thought this was a parody. Then I thought it was a nightmare. All these young men wanting to be famous without a talent, other than persistence and youth. A few FIND their love of music after their instagram fame. But then I got hooked and it just became sad. One kid had a song that was so similar to another rap song I am waiting for a law suit. Lots of the kids (mostly white) have sad backgrounds with divorce or bullying. Cameron is a smart kid with business smarts. But what are they doing? Do the ever read a book? They never discuss anything deep, but only their own fans and money. Their handlers (except for one Mom) look bewildered. The idiotic girls, who in another generation would simply be Tiger Beat subscribers, become a real security threat. All this to be noticed. Excellent look at the downside of fame. One manager was even texting while driving! That's the idiotic world they live in. I think Cameron will survive with his hustle. Good male model material, which was his original goal. The others I fear will meet a sad fate of many child actors. Weird show but addicting."
tt6370626,"I have got to admit it: I found this series absolutely riveting - but for all the wrong reasons. It was like watching a train wreck or a car smash; I wanted to look away, but I couldn't. I was gobsmacked both by these delusional, self-important, spoiled-brats of young men and by the oodles of screaming girls (and some boys) who follow after them. I just couldn't believe people like this exist! These good-looking, sometimes personable, sometimes obnoxious, entitled but extremely untalented (and extremely unaware of it) young men walk around as if what they do online and in life actually has some value or merit. They have the hubris to refer to themselves during this series as 'the talent' (despite having none) and 'influencers'. Heaven help us if these people actually have influence, but I guess they may because it seems there are actually young people who are caught up in all this, attending their idols' appearances, screaming, fainting and acting like they were at a Beatles concert in the 1960's. It's absolutely unbelievable. I hope for their sakes that these young guys made money out of this stage of their lives and that they have invested it wisely, because at some point it will all come crashing down and they'll be forgotten. It has to happen. (Please let it be soon!)This is a fascinating and scary insight into the cult of celebrity, although I don't think that was the makers' intention. I recommend that every adult and definitely every parent should watch at least a few episodes of this. It's an eyeopener and it's scary."
tt6370626,"This ""show"" is about a group of kids, who are complete morons. They think they are celebrities because a bunch of really young girls follow them on social media. It mainly focuses on Cameron who will say things such as ""I like hanging out with my best friend because he doesn't look at me like everyone else does, he looks at me like I'm normal""... This 20 year old is constantly playing with his hair and acting like a complete jackass, disrespecting his peers in the process. You can tell he never had a father figure in his life, someone to bring him back down to reality and spank that butt. Its easy to see his Mom let him get away with anything and everything growing up. He acts like he thinks he is a God or something, he has no idea.They call each other ""the talent"" when speaking about the other members of the group. I watched all the episodes and I am still trying to figure out what their talent is. In reality, they have no talent at all, unless being a complete idiot and being extremely conceded is a talent. I watched all the episodes because I couldn't not watch this train wreck of a show and how messed up these kids are. And I guess that is the brilliance in the show, you can't help but to watch it. But most normal people look at these guys and shake their head in disbelief because of what they are saying. Its kind of like the Anna Nicole Smith or Whitney Houston reality shows, you just cant help but to watch the train wreck. Most people thank God that they are not in their shoes because they really have no idea what is actually important in life. But they hopefully will one day once their 2 minutes of fame is over, and trust me, because they have no talent that time is coming sooner rather than later."
tt6370626,"It's just terrible waste of time. If ""Haters back off!"" was funny enough to watch, this is just ZERO. A bunch of kids who got no talent at anything just showing off their abs and Calvin's to screaming girls. It's just this! Huge mistake of Netflix. I googled the subject and was not happy to knew that Shawn Mendes was messing around with that bunch of so-called ""social media influence"". I'm not surprised that there is just one review - it's very hard to describe what happening on the screen in more just one sentence. I've read in some reviews that Cameron Dallas will have a big future in Hollywood - doubt this. What's the most disappointing for me is that there are lots of really talented kids and teens on the social media who are really talented in what they do - like Shawn Mendes, all the sports-persons, amateur singers, musicians, but we got this..."
tt6370626,What a disgrace.They left a black boy behind in another country and didn't do anything about it. Pays to be white in America.This show should be banned.Shame on Netflix.
tt6370626,this show is so good. i couldn't stop watching it. i finished the whole show in one night. i know i am supposed to hate it but i definitely do not and am now having withdrawals without another season to binge. this show has so much drama and gives an inside look at social media influencers life. the magcon boys encountered a lot of problems along the way and overcame a lot in the first season of this show. can't wait to see what season 2 has to offer.
tt10406826,"Super planned , fake , avoid it . It's a copy from a Hollywood show which was obvious ."
tt10406826,"The only positive about this show is how Karan genuinely connects with the contestants, and gives them some good insight. The artificiality of each date is evident, but I felt the advice being given by the celebrities and Karan was good in general. Worth a one time watch, maybe when you are chilling during a long drive and have time to kill. What I didn't like is the complete lack of humor, the only person funny was Karan Johar. Maybe that's the major lacking trait for all the contestants-humor sense. If they had that the show would've been so much better to watch."
tt10406826,This is not only pathetic but a horrific attempt to portray modern times and love. Irrelevant and boring.
tt10406826,"Series like this should never be created. You say a person is beautiful, then why do they need makeover??? It's all scripted drama but it portrays a wrong image on teens and creates a lot of insecurities among them.
Sadly, there are no ""cool"" series which show what true love is all about."
tt10406826,"Did he actually direct some movies? How artificial, superficial and stereotyped this show was. Pathetic!"
tt10406826,"This entire show is scripted. This show is so badly done. For example the sardar guy is a fake Punjabi guy. Made him say ""balle balle"" so many times. Real Punjabi guys done say ""balle balle"" out of no where."
tt10406826,"I am not a big fan of Karan. But this show is quite good and useful for many, youth of this era can learn so many things from this show, The shows teaches you To enhance your personality and how to make yourself positive also it make you get your self esteem . Every movie and show has some flaws that doesn't mean you can't find perfections and strength."
tt10406826,"Entirely staged , fake and exceedingly annoying.
Worse thing I have ever seen. Couldn't move past 2 episodes.
It looked bad from the trailer but wanted to give it a shot. Turns out it was garbage after all at so many levels."
tt10406826,"I really don't understand the negativity around this show. I found it highly enjoyable, if not outstanding. Karan is an effortless host who quickly builds a real banter with the participants. The people themselves are fairly interesting with their own unique stories and challenges; and the production, particularly the set design, is excellent.
Some criticism seems to be levied at the participants receiving makeovers, but the makeovers are subtle and reasonable; and the people are fairly varied in appearance and background. I felt like the participants were realistic and believable people, nothing like the homogeneous appearance-obsessed casts of some other reality shows. Further, much more time is spent helping the cast through their personal challenges than redoing their appearance (In fact the makeover portion takes only ~5 minutes per episode), and the personal help Karan gives is insightful and individual. I definitely saw nothing that portrayed a negative image of beauty or love; quite the opposite in fact.
What the Love! is overall a fresh take on the Western dating show. It's refreshing to see a different culture's take on romance and dating. The host is engaging and full of flair, the participants are compelling, and the production is very good. Don't be dissuaded by the negative reviews; fans of other modern 'heartwarming' reality shows should give this one a try. I'm hoping for a second season."
tt10406826,"Its a good series I feel like its been criticized for no good reason, best Indian dating series"
tt10406826,"Like almost all of Karan johars recent ventures. This one too is terrible. From ghost stories to soty2.
Don't watch."
tt10406826,"If you are too bored in life, bang your head on the wall, grate your finger, pull your hair, jump out of the window, do whatever, but please DO NOT watch this!
Cheap, Regressive, Irritating, Boring, Fake show"
tt10406826,Cringy. Way cringy. And I feel like punching the contestants and Karan in the face.
tt10406826,This idiots Kjo just doesn't stop making sh!try movies and TV series 🤦.
tt10406826,Every garbage stuff is dumping on internet. Shows like. This is prime example. Karan and whole team showing fantasy just nothing
tt10406826,"Absolutely saddening to see Netflix actually make and host such disaster of a show. For the very beginning, it is obvious that everything about is scripted. Cringe is induced sharply upon watching this, would Hugh recommend skipping even if this is the last ass show on the plane to stream."
tt10406826,"I have not seen the show but the fact this face appears when i open netflix makes me mad, so iam writing this review. First they ruined Cartoon Network in India during the mid 2000, then Ekta Kapoor ruined the Indian TV , So people moved to watching Series on netflix and other streaming platforms. These guys wont let us watch anything peacefully, they come everywhere and ruin the things. Now Balaji has its own streaming platform called alt balaji and this guy has taken up the task of ruining netflix."
tt10406826,"Very nice, kind and sincere show, you have to have an open mind to understand it, not all the world see/ act or react as Americans, so if you are one of those how have never even live abroad don't waste your time and keep living in your bubble, this show is not for you. If you are well verses and know for a fact there is more than just USA! USA! USA! This show will remind you of love, hope and kindness, highly recommend it."
tt10406826,No idea what Netflix were thinking. Made me vomit when Karan did the whole 'therapist' thing. Why are Netflix pandering to established Bollywood elite when there are innovative and fresh creators in India just waiting for an opportunity to present a real and fresh version of Indians on tv.
tt10406826,Please stop paying this man for pooping out outdated nonsense and plaguing our screens.
tt10406826,"It's a little quirky and lacks the drama of a proper reality show but it forces you to delve into your subconscious. I found when characters were told to understand themselves I also tried to understand myself. It put a lot of throngs in perspective. The casting was diverse; no two people looked the same, had the same personality or even the same issues. The best part is all the guest appearances that are so well suited. Definitely recommend giving this a watch!"
tt10406826,"This show is actually closer to reality than how much reality shows usually are. Even if one might say that it's all staged, the point here to note is that the characters (contestants) themselves are quite realistic. They have issues and insecurities that are very prevalent in society today. The way the show opens up each character and makes them overcome their fears is very commendable. A pleasant surprise from Karan Johar."
tt12748268,"We love word party, but this needed to be one video, not 8 2 min episodes with 2 minute credits. It's intended for toddlers, and they lose interest during credits."
tt4219300,Don't waste your valuable time in this. Lame attempt from everyone involved.
tt1552211,In an act of masochistic boredom I actually watched the entire two and a half hours of this film so I am not being hyperbolic when I say that almost every single scene in this movie did not make any sense.
tt1552211,"The premise is great. Execution, terrible. They take too long for a simple story line. Just replay Extraction again."
tt1552211,"I think the plot or storyline is pretty decent. But the way it was executed was horrible. Changing of scenes felt abrupt with no flow ; found myself questioning who is who. A confusing, yet really slow movie that makes you question if you should continue watching.Interesting idea behind the plot, but what a shame."
tt1552211,"Usually I write positive reviews but for this movie I specifically wanted to add a review so none else lose their time the way i did watching this.
First of all the runtime... why do you take 2,5 hours to develop and conclude this story without actually developing the story itself and its characters..?!
Directing...Olivier Megaton is actually a good director, but here he didn't pay too much attention in the editing or directing. Scenes are scattered and disconnected, with random parallel stories which do not deliver anything extra to the film. They just tire the viewer.
The violence... is only used to provide ""action"" to the slow-burn and dull storyline.
The story itself... the idea is not bad, the delivery and the stretch of the idea to make it a 2,5 hour long movie; yes that's very bad.
Acting...here it is actually 50/50. Some moments are rewarding but not enough to save this film.
Overall, I m rather upset that someone spent all this money to create such a time-consuming, violent and pointless movie. 2/10 , don't waste your time."
tt1552211,"Bad writing, bad filmmaking, bad acting, no chemistry. Boring, tiresome, slow.Truly the worst of Netflix.2.5 hours long! Oh my god.. I'm not sure if anyone will see the ending. I made it 58 mins in and had to shut it off, once I realized the action was as bad as every other part of the film.How far will you make it!?"
tt1552211,"Watch paint dry, this could be the worse film on Netflix.Netflix films had been getting better, not sure why they are buying awful films that would have been in the bargin bucket in blockbusters in the day.The film will probably get a cult following from being so bad."
tt1552211,"The name is appealing however at a point I felt like that this was another movie produced, written, directed by our very own Tommy Wiseau."
tt1552211,"I do buy the concept of this story. Such an inspiring and original one. Yet the director should have elaborated it more. Now turned out it's not romantic, not heroic, not stunning and no twisted ending. Many plot holes and rough edges. Personally I would say it's not bad to kill your time on Saturday night with this movie. It's just.... I expected more of it.Iconic concept can't really guarantee an iconic movie."
tt1552211,"The worst movie i have ever seen. Shame on you Hollywood and Netflix.
The title has been wasted on this movie"
tt1552211,"It tries to be a big heist thriller, but it is just too long and boring."
tt1552211,"I did enjoy watching this film. Edgar Ramirez did a great job and so are most of the cast. Not the best film out there but it sure is entertaining for fans of action flicks and the like. Now for the bad reviews, I understand that a lot of young kids has got easy access to Netflix nowadays especially during this time of the pandemic where everyone is usually at home 24/7. This movie is not for Kids, hence they shouldn't be reviewing this film. I gave it 8 stars for the fact that the kids who put out their reviews have underrated this film. Watching a movie while on your mobile phone at the same time doing facebook is not gonna let you enjoy watching this film or any other film for that matter."
tt1552211,"This film clocks in at around 2 and a half hours long and it simply can't keep the viewer invested that long, the characters are dull, the plot of the film doesn't Make much sense at all and the biggest name in the film is a minor character at best. If you like good action Heist films this will probably not satisfy you in anyway.If you want a great heist movie with plenty of heart and decent acting go watch 'The Town' which is also on Netflix."
tt1552211,"The movie suffers from horrible acting, long unreal action scenes, a plethora of plot holes and has NOTHING to do with the stopping of the american crimeI recommend not to watch with all my heart, those are 2 hours and a half you'll never get back!"
tt1552211,"Decent story if it had been done right. Some ok parts.Overall, irritating acting. Boring characters. Tries to hard.Netflix pushing quantity over quality. Again."
tt1552211,It sounds like an interesting concept but unfortunately it falls into the seen-it-all before category. Cliche scenes and nonsense dialogue. No likeable characters and the main one has a one expression face which I found irritating. It won't keep your attention and it's not worth the time.
tt1552211,"Great?: No..Dumb?: Pretty damn dumbUnpredictable?: oh yesIn a good way?: not reallyPlot holes?: craters more like it, you can't even imagine!Confusing?: incrediblyBad acting?: horribleExcept for Michael Pitt?: Except for Michael Pitt of courseFunny?: Michael Pitt isAnnoying?: Edgar Ramírez is..How does he keep getting work by the way, I mean he's soooo bad?: he's kinda handsome, I guess?He kinda looks like a bearded John Mayer doesn't he?: yeah maybe that's it.Bad writing?: Well duhWait, Sharlto Copley is in it?: oh yeah, almost forgot, he doesn't get much to doIs his character at least an important part of the story?: No that's just it, not at all, there is absolutely no reason at all for him to be there!Overly long?: overly long!Gratuitous sex scenes?: whadda you think?Will I enjoy myself if I expect nothing and completely turn my brain of?: I did!Is that a redeeming quality?: I guess not .."
tt1552211,Caused a permanent eye sore. Bad writing and stupid plots. Doesn't qualify to be produced.
tt1552211,"I am not entirely sure why there is such extreme negative criticism of this film. It is a well made film based on a graphic novel that is in a style of classic American crime and action films with a dystopia police state future. It reminds me of films like Shoot 'Em Up, Crank, Death Race, and Children of Men. It is great to see studios putting effort and budget into adapting non family friendly graphic novels.People really need to realize that giving such harsh reviews unnecessarily to films adapted from graphic novels will only discourage studios from adapting more comic books/graphic novels into film.Aside from a few slow moments in the film it is actually a decent crime action film that's well shot, well acted, and you can tell they took it seriously. Also Michael Pitt was great in this film and feel he was the stand out actor in his role.I've read a lot of negative reviews based on police brutality and riots being in the film which is the dumbest excuse to give a film negative reviews. So you're telling me that the people who started making this film years ago were trying to make a film that was what, mocking our current state of the country?! Good movie, don't over think things and just enjoy a cheasy action movie."
tt1552211,"Who cares what happens to anybody in this film? No story, just a bunch of scenes where the stars say random lines to try and sound profound. How did anyone in good faith ever hand real money(not monopoly) to someone for making this utter drivel."
tt1552211,"I liked it, good, but it doesn't have to be that long, a good script, plot and performances, action, ingenious, nothing sublime, but entertaining, good..."
tt1552211,"All is in the title.
This is a typical american action movie, not the best out there but nothing justifies that people are rating it 1 or 2...
It's an average 6-7 according to me. There is a lot of action and the story is quite good, plus that fear of some kind of ""big brother"" government is still an actual thing.
There is no reason not to listen to that one if you're just based on bad reviews."
tt1552211,"Netflix has blessed (or ""blessed"") us with yet another crime blockbuster, this time one directed by Olivier Megaton (""Transporter 3"", ""Taken 2"", ""Colombiana""), who's no stranger to action movies. The critical acclaim has never been real high for him, and, sadly, ""The Last Days of American Crime"" is within the same ballpark as all his movies before. Personally, this is my least favorite chapter in his filmography.In a not-too-distant future, as they put it, U.S. government is a week away from activating a signal that will make it impossible for people to go against the law, any and all law. It will do so via brain rape, just try lifting a gun or shoplifting a snickers and you'll freeze and shake uncontrollably. You probably can hear the sarcasm and irony already, so yes, I did not enjoy this movie a lot. Besides that particular interesting and far-fetched idea, it's a highly conventional and thoroughly mildly frustrating crime flick romp, featuring plot and characters based off ancient blueprints. Some characters are no more than a mere sketch, like the one given to the guy I was excited to see the most, Sharlto Copley. His storyline went down the mill and down the hill. First half an hour is mostly pure and simple exposition, and the action doesn't even change gears until 70 minutes into already. There's all the usual romance and subplots, all of which end up just about where You expect them. The melodrama at play here really ticks all the most typical and overused boxes. Movie's real enemy, though, is its runtime. It is way too long for its own good, way too long and featuring way too little, clocking in at 2 hours and 20 minutes & that's not counting titles. A story of this depth and this quality usually deserves maybe a 100 minutes, maybe, and even then it still is what it is. At the very least, I was expecting a good heist factor. Everything leads up to it, only for me to understand that it's the wackiest, most unexciting heist movie ever. Frankly, the heist plot and even the crime-stopping-signal plot matter very little in the big picture of ""The Last Days of American Crime"". They say the graphic novel this movie's based on, is great and all. I don't know about that, but the adaptation certainly isn't great.The Positives? Acting. No award material on the horizon, but decent portrayals of dry characters, with the highlight probably being Anna Brewster and Michael Pitt, though Pitt's character is not easy to like. Next positive would be big budget. Movie looks arguably good, though still, by all means, it's undoubtedly an uninspired blockbuster. Crisp, contrastive cinematography, sometimes overkilled in editing, we also got explosions, raging guns, crashes and whatnot. The typical drivel, it just happens to be well made here. And original score, soundtrack - also decent. For a big part, the movie is pretty macho, many male characters are like that, boys, and if there's one truth in this world, it's that boys will be boys. The original score, being rocky and bluesy, went hand in hand with that. As for the soundtrack, it reminded of ""Sucide Squad"", because it had good songs, but no good reason to use them whatsoever. ""The Last Days of American Crime"" ended with Depeche Mode's ""Personal Jesus"" - kind of a waste on a two-bit cliché ending like this one.It's a movie of no originality, but it's not exactly bad at being a well made conventional crime thriller, I mean as conventional as it gets, despite its sci-fi-ish backdrop. It shoots itself in all the rest proverbial knees by making itself a 2 and a half hour experience, major mistake there. Regardless of the runtime, but even more because of it, I don't recommend watching this brick of a movie. My rating: 5/10."
tt11860336,It's a super generic kids show. It has trains. Not good not bad.If you've ever seen super wings it's kinda like that. The 'heroes' get themselves in their own trouble. No real lessons are taught.Was advertised as from the creators of paw patrol. It's a let down from that. Paw patrol is even entertaining as an adult.For kid train showed you can't go wrong with Thomas and friends. Chuggington is far simpler with clearer lessons. If you want over the top and way too ambitious for a kids show then robot trains on Amazon prime is for you.
tt11860336,Yet once again the North Americans copy a successful program from the UK and make a mess of it.Stick to Thomas The Tank Engine far better & more entertaining stories to male you kid think and just sit watching the screen and getting dumber by the second.
tt11860336,"My review of the show, which was made in October, was taken down from the site for some reason. Well, I will not be silenced any longer. It's my opinion and I'm entitled to have it. Anyways, on with the review:As the year is coming to a close, and I have watched almost all of the cartoons that came out this year, I have finally found what I consider to be the worst kids cartoon of 2020: Mighty Express.This show, made by the people behind Paw Patrol, is a shoddy attempt to compete with the popularity of Thomas the Tank Engine. As bad as the modern seasons of Thomas are, they at least have more nuance and depth than whatever the heck Mighty Express is. Heck, even Chuggington was better than this piece of excrement.The show is very loud and frenetic with a lot of action, bright colors, and sound effects. The show is also very unrealistic. The thing that I love about classic Thomas is that it adhered to railway realism, seeing as the Reverend W. Awdry was a huge rail buff himself. But on this show, the characters have overly fancy tools and regularly jump off the rails. The characters are all bland and forgettable as well. I can't name a single trait about any of the characters other than they're cheerful and kind.This show is so toyetic it hurts. Then again, it was made by a toy company. Please avoid this show, it's really bad. It openly talks down to children and has no educational value whatsoever. If you want a good train show, I recommend seasons 1-7 and seasons 17-21 of Thomas the Tank Engine. It's one of my favorite shows, but I can't say the same for the trainwreck (badumtsh) that is Mighty Express."
tt11860336,"...well, a sorry excuse for a show. It's colourful and loud, but seems like an excuse for another line of toy trains. My 3yo watches it, but gets bored so quickly, he'd rather watch Thomas. He literally call the show: ""The rubbish train show"".Really not worth watching. How there are 5 seasons of this is anyone's guess.👎"
tt11860336,"My 3 year old didn't think this was Interesting, but when the train in the first ep was out of control she said something about twerking to the pigs, so I immediately turned off the show. SHAME ON YOU, NETFLIX!! As with many shows, this show doesn't have its lack of main characters making bad choices and almost ruining everything before the others save them. Ugh!!"
tt11860336,This show deserves more love on IMDB. My 2 year old really enjoys it. The characters are fun. It's not Sesame St as far as education but the characters learn lessons and the music is catchy. I like that there is a balance with the talking trains and human characters. I can't believe people complained that its not realistic. I thought the whole point of cartoons was escapism. This is why you talked to your kids so they understand what's real and what isn't. The colors used to create the show are very vivid. Bonus points for an inclusive cast that attempts to represent America. I am looking forward to season 2 because we already played the current season many times.
tt11860336,"My toddler absolutely loves this show and we like watching it with him! Really don't see why there are loads of bad reviews. Kids programmes aren't meant to be realistic, there a bit of fun! Brightly coloured trains who talk, human characters of all abilities, genders and races who talk and interact with the trains....what's not to love! Much better than Peppa Pig!!"
tt11860336,This show is great for kids. Super exciting and lots of teamwork. #trainspotting #employee.
tt11860336,Get rid of the old school creepy thomas the tank engine and bring on the mIght express.!!! How can you go wrong with the creators of PAW PATROL. Thank's for the update and making trains cool again!
tt11860336,"Yes is a little unrealistic or maybe really unrealistic but who cares, is sweet and he love the show is no made for old kids or teenagers is more made for kids around 2 and 5 years."
tt11860336,My daughter loved the new series and gave it 10 over 10!
tt0926129,"So, Prom Night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie. I'm a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning, but upon seeing it, it is neither horror or thriller.I was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable. You could predict what was going to happen next. The young actors were alright at playing their characters, but I'd have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting wise.Yes, I'll give props for the plot because it was good, but it's not thrilling or scary. There were almost zero ""jump-in-your-seat"" scenes. So, don't waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres, wait 'til it comes to DVD."
tt0926129,"Now I haven't seen the original version, but I can tell you that it's probably better than the remake. The movie's PG-13 rating takes almost all of the thrill and suspense out of the film.The beginning of the movie starts off sudden, but afterwards there's a nice drought of action until the first prom killing. The PG13 rating makes the death scenes quite bland and boring. You won't see the victims actually getting attacked, but you'll see silhouettes and blood smears. That's about it.The characters in the movie make it seem like you're watching a movie of The Hills. The girls are the classic ""dumb blonde"" stereotypes while the men are the typical ""hard jock"" stereotype. Any angst there is between the characters is very dry and holds no real meaning to the overall movie.The plot is very predictable, I sat through the entire movie correctly guessing what was going to happen next and when something good was going to happen.All in all, this is a good movie if you're looking for some good laughs, but overall don't expect to be extremely happy with the final product. Personally I'd wait for the movie to come out on DVD. If you've seen any other slasher film, chances are you could guess every next move in this movie."
tt0926129,"Good grief I can't even begin to describe how poor this film is. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting much to begin with. Let's face it, a PG-13 slasher flick is pre-destined to be missing the ummm... slashing, so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore. But it was the level of incompetence and cliché on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away. We have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. And here's a turnup for the books... SHE NEVER CHANGES - hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing - character development. If you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again. On top of this, we're handed possibly the least intriguing (and definitely the least scary) killer ever to grace the genre. I'm not joking when I say that Dora the Explorer has scarier villains than this movie.Finally, because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept (and apparently thirteen-year-old) director, what could possibly be left to fill up 2 hours of screen time? Closets, that's what. Lots and lots of closets: big closets, small closets, mirrored closets, closets to Narnia, so many damned closets you'll not want to dress yourself for another year. In fact this movie should have just been called ""CLOSET"", and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the DVD case. On the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by Roger and Ebert - something to the extent of: ""what the f*@! did we just waste our time watching!"""
tt0926129,"...let me count the ways.1. A title-only 'remake' that pulls out every cliché in the slasher handbook.2. A plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic.3. A completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or thrills.4. A PG-13 rating that insures no gore, violence, or sex.5. A villain that is not frightening or even mysterious.6. A cast of characters that are so thinly written and stereotyped that we couldn't possibly care about them.7. A lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere (much unlike the original Prom Night).8. A script of dialog that's beyond poor - it's mind numbing. 9. A series of cardboard performances (not sure whether to blame the actors or the lousy aforementioned script for that).10. A completely inept teen-targeted slasher remake that's not brave enough to attempt to have an imagination - or even to show a puddle of blood.It's a no-brainer horror fans, save your money.BOMB out of ****"
tt0926129,"Prom Night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a Lifetime original film. You know the one. This October, Lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving (insert disease name here) to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker ex-boyfriend. It's dramatic  it's sappy  it's immensely dull. It does nothing to further a genre, tell an original story, or strive for ANY sort of newness. Prom Night shares this plight. Watching the killer poke holes in his victims, we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not a drop of blood spilled. It occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie history.Our director is working with a fairly good-looking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier. Think about Matthew McConaughey coming at you with a knife. You'd probably go  ""OH! Good lookin guy is going to kill me? Naaaa."" Not scary even for a second, so the director throws Schaech into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror. This mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator. You'll get 15 jump scares in this film, 2 of which made my date jump (I might mention she is afraid of EVERYTHING). I'd also mention she decided to take a nap halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave me.As if this film were not disjointed enough, it appears to be cut to shreds. I'm not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew scrambled to salvage some semblance of a horror film; I'm saying as the film moves from scene to scene, you often get a jarring jump. This is the kind of thing you'd expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together, cross his fingers, and hope for the best. The editor should be shot.With a plot you can pack into two sentences, one stray spray of blood, an emo killer, and the tension of a very special episode of ""Silver Spoons"", we're left with no reason to support horror this weekend  at least on the big screen. In fact, this is the sort of film that should be punished. Is it really that hard to make a scary movie? Was this crew even aware they were making a horror film??!! A complete waste of my time and yours. I bit the bullet to get you this review. Don't let my sacrifice be in vain. DON'T GO INTO THE MOVIE!!!"
tt0926129,"I'm not particularly fond of remakes, or to steal the modern jargon ""retellings"", but this film truly peeved me off. The original Prom Night, while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece, still realized what it was... horror. There are some simple things to remember when making a horror film. Suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience. Sorry folks, but a white knuckle film this was not! The scares were cheap, and foreshadowed terribly. (A good example of scare which has been done to clichéd excess now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film) This film couldn't successfully pull that off, so how could I expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film. There needs to be a likable hero or heroine. This film doesn't have one. The person I most identified with was the head detective. His calm demeanor, but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have. Common sense approach to events that occur. (If you're running from an Axe wielding psycho, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. Not jog, whilst looking back ever three seconds, gaging the killer's progress, only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path.) If you friend disappears, you don't go looking for them alone. And if you suspect foul play you tell someone, not investigate yourself. These clichés are tired and well overplayed. In the horror genre in general, and in this film in particular."
tt0926129,"I am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself, but I just got back from this movie, and felt I had to express my opinions. Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE horror fan. But what makes a horror movie? I sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development. I know they often lack in horror movies, but Prom Night looked like it didn't even put forth ANY effort in that department. Next, we all love suspense. That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises. Yeah, Prom Night had none of that! Of course, we like a terrifying killer. Prom Night have that? Nope, it has a pretty boy with a cute lil' knife. And when all else fails...at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore, and the occasional nude scene! Yeah, well when you have a horror movie rated PG-13 like Prom Night, they leave that stuff out too. So with all of these elements missing, I ask....does this still count as a horror movie? Nope. I'd call it more of a comedy. People in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when I saw ""Semi-Pro"" that was supposed to actually be a comedy (which also sucked, but thats another story!). I think I am just going to have to give up on new horror. All the good horror movies of the good ol' days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money. The people I went to see it with didn't even know this was a remake! Which made me mad! I wonder what will happen when there's no more movies to remake??? Where will horror go next???"
tt0926129,"I remember watching this as a kid and it smacked, now i'm 21 and it still smacks."
tt0926129,"***Three Out of Ten Stars*** Where does one begin to try to explain what a complete debacle of a disgrace this film is? Right off the bat, you know you're in trouble when a film production needs eight different producers to get off the ground. This means you have eight different people pulling in eight different creative directions, even if they delusion-ally believe they're all headed in the same direction; they're not. I don't need to re-numerate all the negative aspects of this film which have already been posted on this web site. What I will say, is what a terrible shame Sony dropped $20,000,000 on this waste of a film. Imagine the long line of creative, budding horror film makers that would've jumped at the chance to work with a mere $5,000,000; and in turn, undoubtedly, producing a unique and artistic horror film creation. But instead of adding to the artistic ingenuity of the horror genre, Sony drops this pile of crap in our laps. Thanks for nothing Sony."
tt0926129,"Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night. And by doing so killing her family, friends, and her enemies. Now before I begin let me say have you been tired of PG-13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately. Are you tired of stupid girl dialog 'Oh my god' and talking about girlish things. And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying. And the last thing are you tired of the US remaking Asian, Japanese, and Chinese films. That pretty much sums up Prom night but I'm still not done with the review.The only reason to see 'Prom night' is to crack a laugh at the kills. If not, don't see Prom night. You never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall. And by the way the deaths are repeating like 24/7. So not only aren't they scary but it's obnoxious. By the time I met the cast I think I was ready to hurl. Too much girl talk, too much guy talk, and lots of 'Oh my gosh. It's our prom'. I understand it's fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate. If I were to put Prom Night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films I'd be the first one too. I'm not going to be surprised if it gets released on DVD for cheap and quick. Seriously don't spend your money or the time for dull acting, cheap scares, and a 'Night to die for' when watching the film.1 star out of 10. (P.S. If I could give the film zero stars I would)."
tt0926129,"This movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business. The idea that audiences paid to see this movie (and like an idiot I rented the film) is discouraging also.Obsessed teacher (3 years prior) kills teenager's family because he wants her. For no reason he kills the mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction. Years later, obsessed teacher breaks out of prison. HMM--usual bad writing--no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute. Obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a Navy SEAL and can sneak around, sniff out people and with a knife is super killer. Sure!!! Now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason, knifes bellhop for the fun of it, and starts to hunt down the teenager's friends. Now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you. Obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel---again it is stupid, ever cop would know his face--but he walks right by them. Now he kills two cops outside teenager's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend.There is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage. If any other profession put out work of this low quality, they would be fired. Yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash."
tt0926129,"Imagine the scenario - you are at the movie theater only because you are in Washington for the weekend and it's raining and you're finished with the Museums. You think you might go see the Sarah Marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you don't have to engage your brain. It's sold out. Options? - The Bank Job, In Bruges, The Leatherheads or Prom night. You've seen the Bank Job (suprisingly decent heist movie that) and In Bruges (again, pretty good) so you're down to two. You don't fancy watching Clooney or the nice one from the Office run around in 1930 football uniforms, so you go see Prom Night right? Wrong. You take the $8.50, walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for $8.50. It would be money better spent.It actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror/thriller or whatever it is supposed to be. If I was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut I wouldn't know whether to laugh or cry. Probably both. An insult to anyone's intelligence... my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie, as for the acting, they might as well have cast robots (or maybe dogs) in the roles, they would have been more realistic. The detective has to be possibly the worst actor I have ever seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan (I hate his acting so much I don't care how you spell his name) you are relieved on your title(s)) So in summary 'not good'"
tt0926129,"For the teen generation, this adaption of the 1980's slasher ""Prom Night"" will prove to be a little fun scream-fest. When I first heard that they were remaking the original prom night, My expectations were glum. After viewing some truly horrible remake films in the past, I had almost given up. I acquired an advance screening ticket to this movie and who am I to give up a free movie ticket? The film started off as you would expect. A little character development combined with some backstory and mystery. I wont give anything away but it is a little weak and leaves the audience wanting more information. As the teens arrive at the Prom, Donna (played by Bittany Snow) is trying to forget the horrors of her past but little does she know, shes in for one hell of a night. A stalker which is obesessed with her has broken out of prison and come to find her. The night is filled with screams and blood(not a lot of which I might add) and it all ends in disaster. The acting throughout this film is not great but is believable. The actress who plays ""Lisa"" really does shine in this film. All in all, Prom Night is not a masterpiece. Its an entertaining, guilty pleasure that is sure to leave the younger generation with a smile on their face. Take it for what it is. Don't! and I repeat Don't have high expectations!"
tt0926129,"I've not seen the original (1980) Prom Night but the remake was not really scary but it was quite entertaining. The story is about Donna (or Donor Kebabs for a laugh) who is away to a prom with her friends and expects it to be the best night of her life, but an obsessed killer is after her (which is related to her terrible past). The story is simple and the cast is unknown but it is better that way because then you can just concentrate on the mystery.At first the prom was beautiful with a great atmosphere but turns into horror. It is another low budget slasher movie which has been tackled a lot of times in Hollywood but I had no problem with it because I had a good time watching it and you can see every penny spent from the $18 million budget. Prom Night is not the kind of film that is going to appeal to everyone and it is best not to take it too seriously. I would recommend it to people who liked movies like Scream."
tt0926129,"Wow, what an awful movie. Bad writing, bad acting, bad clichés; I really wish I could have the 1 1/2 hours of my life back. This definitely wins the award for the worst movie of 2008 so far. What were they thinking when they made this movie? It's like they put nothing special into it; nothing we've never seen before. Did they really think this was going to work? I knew, going into it, that it would be a bad movie, but I didn't think it'd be the WORST. The only way I'd see this movie again is if I was strapped to my seat, duct tape around my mouth, and my eyes taped open. Even then, I think the sight of seeing me like this would be more exciting than the movie.Save your money!"
tt2951576,"Abhay Deol is the only actor from Deol's family who has always stood out with method-thinking role but with One By Two he loses sheen of performance which might prove to be fatal for his career.One By Two tells the story of rendezvous between two different people Amit and Samara who are going through turmoil in their life.First time Devika Bhagat gives an account of life in a metropolitan city but falls flat on the face with poor direction and extremely pathetic screenplay. The movie is unconvincing from start till end and baring few scenes is weak overall. Music is horrible considering coming from Shankar-Eshaan- Loy. Abhay Deol is just about OK but it is Preeti Desai and Lillete Dubey who gives an outstanding performances.Overall, it is a weak film in all the merits. Poor 1/5"
tt2951576,"Without going into any introductory lines, I would straight come to the point giving you the shocking news that if you also had a strong opinion (like myself) that there ought to be something out of the box or path breaking whenever the thinking actor ABHAY DEOL goes for producing a film, then unfortunately we were all quite wrong. Because here is a film co-produced by Abhay in which he does try to go out of the box, but in the attempt, mistakenly kicks the ball so hard that it goes out of the stadium instead of the box, never to be found again.In fact the above statement is the best way to express the experience of watching ONE BY TWO frankly, as in this too the viewer desperately keeps waiting for the story to begin in its entire 135 minutes, just like waiting for the ball to be brought back into the stadium. But the director is simply not interested in beginning her tale even till 125 minutes into the film and then decides to end exactly at the point where the story actually begins. So that should say it all if you really wish to know about the film's basic story progression. However for the fans, who are still eager to know more about this unexplainable, pale, boring & hard to watch film (featuring the thinking actor), then here are my one liner conclusions formed after painfully going through this badly made film, as mentioned below:""It feels really great and intellectual watching the maestro WOODY ALLEN's films, but one shouldn't dare to try that ever if he or she doesn't have that deep understanding of life, vision, clarity & a dialogue writer by the side having a similar, gifted intellect.""""ONE BY TWO is probably the only Hindi Film in which the lead pair doesn't meet each other ever, till the last scene in the climax & yet its supposed to be a love story with all those interesting love songs.""""When there are so many reality shows thrown at our faces every evening through the numerous channels, do the film-makers still think that the viewers would be interested in watching another one on the big screen spending both their time and money?""""Many a times, films are made just to establish a particular person and ONE BY TWO has clearly been made to establish PREET DESAI in the industry, since the film completely focuses on her, ignoring everyone else including the hero Abhay Deol. The girl looks pretty but gets totally betrayed by a poorly chosen script and her own foreign accent.""""ONE BY TWO is a film which repeatedly uses 'Toilet Humour' in its badly written dialogues in the most disgusting manner.""""It is undoubtedly the weakest, silliest and the most pathetic script Abhay Deol has ever featured in and the same can be said about his uncaring act in the film too.""""If you wish to watch a veteran like Rati Agnihotri hamming in the role of a mother then do watch ONE BY TWO""""One of the songs of film goes with the lyrics, ""I am just Pakaaoed!"" and that's precisely what one feels several times, while watching the film in the theater.""Summing up, there is indeed one out of the box, yet interesting feature of the film to be found in its fine SOUNDTRACK, which though remains completely wasted in the film, but still has many good tracks in it written thoughtfully. The best track of the album remains ""Khuda Na Khaasta"" sung by Arijit Singh, followed by ""Khushfehmiyan"" by Shankar Mahadevan, ""Baat Kya Hai"" by Clinten Cerejo, ""Shehar Mera"" by Thomson Andrews and ""Kaboom"" by Anushka Manchanda.However listening to the tracks once again online, I really wish they were used in a different film with a decent amount of sanity in its script giving them proper justice. And yes, Abhay Deol was perfectly right if he was very much concerned about the music not reaching the audience in time, since the tracks do have a lot to say both in terms of rendition as well as the lyrics, moving ahead than many other OST's, honestly.Anyway, as a film ONE BY TWO turns out to be the first highly disappointing film delivered by one of the most reliable and dependable actors of Hindi cinema i.e. Abhay Deol. And the actor shouldn't have really opted for such a useless script at all."
tt2951576,"I wish there is a 0 rating available to assign to this movie. Amazingly pathetic and no clue what the team of this movie was trying to say. I agree movie makers want to show confused young generation, come on but life is still not this dumb that they showed. and seriously, I did not expect Abhay Deol to do a movie like this.Cut the long story short, Sheer waste of efforts, time and money by both Makers and viewersDon't WATCH THIS Don't WATCH THIS Don't WATCH THISI did not have any words for this review. So I think 10 lines rule should be removed for such movies"
tt2951576,"This movie is indeed out of ordinary ""A"" level commercial movie we see. The story and the message behind it can not be seen by everyone. It can be called- not a romantic, not a comedy, not a family movie but mixture of one other in a ""not quite correct"" ratio. The music-some were good. But the music at flash dance, was not as exclusive it was tried to shown. rather the last song and dance were better. But the most negative impact was in the dancing clips- at the first dance, it was a ballet dance actually originated from Italy. But India do not have viewers of this kind of dancing I guess, whatever, The real ballet dance is far more superior then this only some leg and hand movements. If you want to show something, show it good. As a result, The heroin, in her dance movements showed no skills. But some funny parts like ""washing powder jingle"" and Poet reciting party as well as the hero's half-naked dancing in the engagement party was the main parts to watch I guess. The side-characters actors did indeed well jobs on their parts. Them and the story-these two things were the main strings to carry out the weight. The goal of the story was mainly to keep the viewers waiting to see when they meet. This is the reason I think may be it took Indian movies at a height, not so far from present, but yes a little bit."
tt2951576,"i find the film wholly entertaining.abhay deol has graciously played his role of pakaoed IT freak. not necessarily every movie should present it's lead actor as an inspiration for masses. the movie is full of wittingly sarcastic remarks. the plot is unexpected all along with it's highs and lows but never boring.music is refreshingly fresh with crazy lyrics. dialogues are as in normal conversation never superfluous. sidecharacters of shashika, ACP dhawan, amit's parents and friends are fun to watch. story could be common but presentation is entirely offbeat. the movie would definitely qualify for contemporary cinema. better watch it in theatre than wait for DVD print..."
tt2951576,"'One by Two' is An Under-Rated Film! An enjoyable, slice-of-life film, that is realistic, humorous & engaging. It might not follow the usual clichés that Hindi Film romances do, but it still has a fresh approach. 'One by Two' Synopsis: This is the story of Amit and Samara - two souls in Mumbai, a city of millions & how the universe conspires to bring them together.'One by Two' is about two diverse souls, who are inter-connected with their each-other due to many circumstances. Its about a guy who's heartbroken after a failed love-affair & an ambitious dancer who's giving her best to make a name for herself. Its the diversity between its protagonists, which makes 'One by Two' a memorable affair. But, there are some flaws. the slow-pacing, firstly, needed some serious persuasion. The pace is consistently slow, which tends to get to you at times. Also, the running-time, over 135 minutes, needed some trimming.Devika Bhagat's Screenplay offers an interesting tale of two diverse individuals, with freshness & some really funny dialogue. Bhagat's Direction, on the other-hand, is simple. Cinematography is standard. Editing lacks sharpness. Performance-Wise: Abhay Deol is natural to the core. He delivers a believable performance. Preeti Desai, keeping aside her faulty diction, is confident & shows off her dancing skills without any inhibitions. Amongst the supporting cast, Darshan Jariwala & Rati Agnihotri are a joy to watch. On the whole, 'One by Two' is certainly worth a watch."
tt2951576,"Life is shown as quite complex for the lead actors and the mother of Amit(lead actor) tells him that life is so simple....hey' both are equally true....we just need to change our attitude towards life....as the Sameera (lead actress) said in end "" i have stopped believing in fairy tales""....we all need to be realistic before situations become complex...I liked the concept- a non-compromising behavior and i think it was such a beautiful way of representing...I watched it on TV and the volume levels were quite up and down after each scene and i was required to continuously up/down the volume part... That was the only low side of watching it...A must watch for everyone in young and middle-age generation to understand the complexities of life and winning over it without compromising for materialistic things..."
tt2951576,"The movie was an out of the box experience, literally!! It was just like reading a well written novel. The suspense was just about optimum and maintained right throughout the movie.Normally, I am known to dole out bad reviews for most Bollywood films, but this one simply caught me by surprise! Great acting by Abhay Deol. He never lets me down in that department. Preeti Desai was okay. She put in a good effort.The movie will come as a breather for those chronically frustrated by Bollywood's habit of dishing out stale melodramatic no-brain movies.Thumbs up to the production team! This movie simply does not deserve such bad reviews from a moronic audience!"
tt2951576,"Release date: 31 Jan 2014 Banner: Amit Kapoor Abhay Deol Sanjay Kapoor Vikram Khakhar Viacom 18 Motion Pictures Director: Devika Bhagat Producer: Abhay deol Writer: Devika Bhagat Stars: Abhay deol,preeti desai Story Line: How do like your soup to be served? Amit likes it one by two. Yes, it is the same Abhishek who is super-pakaoed with life. But why is Amit so pakaoed afterall? Well, there are many reasons. Samara, on the other hand, is frustrated with her life. She loves dancing, but success seems a dream too far-fetched for her. Devika Bhagat's One By Two tracks the lives of Amit (played by Abhay Deol) and Samara (played by Preeti Desai). If you are expecting a typical Bollywood masala flick, this movie is not for you. However, if you just want to relax and enjoy a good romantic-comedy, this is it. Amit is a regular guy, stuck in a monotonous life: work, home, sleep, repeat. To make matters worse, his girlfriend Radhika dumped him. And now his mom (played by Rati Agnihotri) wants him to get married to a girl named Shisikaa (yes, that's her name) from Prabhadevi. Well, now you can really imagine why Amit is so pakaoed. Samara is an aspiring dancer. But there is always something or the other coming in her way of success. What happens when these two meet? Is there any meet-cute situation? This is a film on self discovery and following one's dreams, and has been very well done for its quirky concept. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music is melodic and groovy. Especially the track Kaboom by Anushka Manchanda – it is peppy, the kind of song which you can listen to in order to boost up your lazy mornings. Khushfehmiyan, by Shankar Mahadevan and Sheher Mera by Thomas Andrews are easy on the ears. Overall, the tracks are nicely done and are hummable. Why must you watch the movie? One By Two is a romantic-comedy without the usual syrupy melodrama. There are no saccharine-sweet dialogues or the usual hero-heroine song-dance sequence. The movie is about two people living two different lifestyles. Despite its flaws, the movie genuinely is a break from the recent torturous bombardment of loud and over-the-top Bollywood movies. We would definitely like to see more of Abhay & Preeti's togetherness on screen www.bollywodjuncture.com Script Analysis: Two is a romantic-comedy without the usual syrupy melodrama. There are no saccharine-sweet dialogues or the usual hero-heroine song-dance sequence. The movie is about two people living two different lifestyles. Despite its flaws, the movie genuinely is a break from the recent torturous bombardment of loud and over-the-top Bollywood movies. We would definitely like to see more of Abhay & Preeti's togetherness on screen Star Performance: Abhay Deol as Amit Sharma plays the role as written. But is not at his usual best. C'mon, I just can't get over the Abhay Deol from DevD and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. It is difficult to say, whether he was 'acting' pakaoed or was actually pakaoed in the whole movie. Most of the time, other then sulking, he farted, burped and farted some more. Excuse me please. At times it gave some comic relief, but later, it became a tad redundant. Preeti Desai as Samara just dazzled. The viewers got a break from the sulky face (and potty talks) of Abhay Deol with her graceful dance moves and screen presence. However, the on screen chemistry of the real life couple didn't create as many sparks as was expected and hence became a rather disappointing affair. Lillete Dubey and Rati Agnihotri did a fine job playing the mothers of the respective protagonists – albeit with a little over-acting now and then. Jayant Kriplani and Darshan Jariwala also did a commendable job as supporting actors. Direction, Editing and Screenplay: Devika is good at all and delivers a fresh movie.Sceenplay could have been better..."
tt7422638,"I don't mind lowering my standards for a cheesy christmas movie, but with this level of acting, it's very hard to do."
tt7422638,"The concept is cute, as are the enthusiastic child actors. However, I feel like I'm sitting thru a school play - for a film someone spent money making the acting is awful from nearly all involved. I had to pretend I was watching it to support the kids.
My 5 year old son has no concept of what's good acting and he enjoyed it, so there's that."
tt7422638,"This is a pretty crappy movie. The story is okay, but it's not unique and certain elements of it, like Christmas supposedly being ruined if one person's Christmas wish isn't fulfilled (which has probably happened millions of times in the 21st century alone) make no sense. The main premise is that three elves loose a bag of Christmas wishes, and they have to go recover them from the town these wishes came from.There's also a subplot about a family learning to cope with the death of their father. This was probably the high point, and there was a genuinely well done scene at the end of the movie where the father's widow finds a box of his things and reads a letter he left her, and starts crying. The widow's acting in this scene is actually quite impressive.And it's the only impressive acting in the entire movie. The three elves couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. The asian one (Can't remember any of their names, and there's no way I'm going to re-watch this movie to find them) is especially bad. His acting is very stiff and he sounds like he's having trouble pronouncing his lines.When the three of them accidentally destroy the bag of Christmas wishes, they yell ""No!"" but instead of panicked or even slightly worried, they sound bored as hell. Santa Claus himself doesn't get much screen time, and his acting is acceptable, but he looks like a forty year old man with a beard strapped to his face. Would it have been that hard to find a guy who's actually old to play this part? I doubt it.There's another character, who's name I once again can't remember. He's supposed to be the elves's supervisor. I think his character is supposed to provide comic relief, but the way his actor says the lines makes him seem more like a pedophile. Combine that with the fact that his job is too watch three small children work, and things get creepy.Also, there's a brief scene in which two elves floss (the dance move) and it burns your eyes.Most of the dialogue is very poorly written, and the jokes are almost all painful. There are a handful of jokes that are actually pretty funny, but they are few and far between.It's not an abomination, but a handful of good jokes and one well directed scene can't save 48 Christmas Wishes from being a bad, bad movie."
tt7422638,"Do you respect yourself? No really, do you? If so, don't watch this movie. It's truly awful. I mean the acting makes you wish for the end of Christmas. I needed a shower after it. Sometimes it still wakes me up at night."
tt7422638,"Young kids may enjoy it, but the bad acting was painful to watch."
tt7422638,This is very bad acting. The dog might of had the best acting.
tt7422638,"I think one of the producers could have done a better job using a handheld camera and his family. The acting was just awful. The sets were the cheapest I've ever seen in a movie. Just awful all together.But, my 7 year old loved it for some odd reason...."
tt7422638,Awful. Couldn't follow no matter how much I tried.
tt7422638,We're about 20 minutes into the film and the acting is hurting my brain. Don't do this to yourseld
tt7422638,"Review Date 4/10/2018This is my 500th review of a Christmas Theme Movie or Special. On all Christmas movies BEWARE OF FAKE REVIEWS & REVIEWERS. Many reviewers have only have ONE REVIEW. When it's a POSITIVE REVIEW chances are that the reviewer was involved with the production. If its a negative review then they may have a huge grudge against the film for whatever reason. I am fare about these films.I find the low IMDB score puzzling. This is also the first review of this film that is being posted. I find it strange that out of over 100 people that voted that I am the first to post a review. The story is this: When a small town's letters to Santa accidentally go up in smoke, two elves venture out of the North Pole to retrieve every missing wish. Along the way they become creative in finding what people wanted for Christmas. Its cute and involving. The children are adorable. They give it their all. This film is meant for the children that still believe in Santa Claus. The story is a little weak but still entertains. Have an open mind."
tt7422638,"I love Christmas movies, especially during this time of year I go a little crazy with watching them. I practically live and breathe the Hallmark channel during November and December.This movies has a sweet wholesome story and of course a happy ending.
Unfortunately throughout the entire film I couldn't get over how awful the acting was. Even the adult actors were dreadful, it was very painful to watch...The little ones might enjoy it, it's defiantly 110% kid friendly.
I would NOT recommend this for teens or adults."
tt7422638,"I honestly don't understand how this movie got all of these bad ratings. I thought it was a lovely movie, like most other christmas movies. I am 22 years old and can honestly say that I enjoyed watching it. Obviously don't expect a complex plot or unpredictability. But it is a nice film. I thought the acting was good, especially the children were amazing.
During the first half of the film I wasn't really sure where it was going, but I can't say that I was ever bored.
Children might enjoy this movie even more than I did. But it's nice to get into the christmas spirit anyway."
tt7422638,"This is a good movie to watch as a family.When I wrote these lines, the imdb rating was 3.9 which is ridiculous - the voters must have been action movie fans.But, the movie is funny, original, tender, etc.The flaw of the film is the editing. All scenes had to be trimmed at the beginning and end of each scene. Some scenes are of no interest and should be deleted.But despite this, I recommend this movie for all ages.This is yet another story with Santa Claus.But this time the heroes are the elves who work on receiving the mail that is meant for Santa Claus - it's the mail that brings the children's wishes.And then, there's trouble in the mail section...So most of the actors are children."
tt7422638,"I've never felt motivated to write a review. But this movie finally did it. They are kids so you want to give them a break, but seriously it's as if they grabbed people off the street and gave them a costume and lines and placed them in the movie. All of the kids acting in this move is stiff, monotone or overacted and awkward. One particular moment is when two elves talk and do some type of dance - I can't even remember the context of the lines because you can't focus on anything except their terrible acting. My 7yr old stepdaughter has more talent in her little toe compared this badly acted movie. The mother is probably the only person who has any talent oh and the boy in the science lab at school is good and seems he should've got a main role. The direction is terrible. The props and costumes are good. The teen daughter is a walking cliche. The dog is cute. I will never let my kids watch this again, well at least not in my presence!"
tt7422638,I love Christmas movies. Will watch even the cheesiest. This one was. As other reviewers have said. Just like a terrible school play. The girl elf is the most annoying child actor ever.
tt7422638,"Terrible script, terrible acting, terrible direction terrible plot (who goes to school on Christmas Eve?!); the elves' ears aren't even the same colour as their real ears in some cases! My wife and I watch a lot of Christmas movies and this is without doubt the worst one we've seen in a very long time."
tt7422638,"Who ever wrote this should retire. The actors are going nowhere after this. Hey, director? What the hell."
tt7422638,"First thing: acting. Kids don't say hmmm and look at the camera every time they get a question
Second: plot. WHERE IS MINNAZONA? also kids don't talk to random people in a theater. NOBODY GOES TO SCHOOL ON CHRISTMAS EVE.
third: just the movie. SO many problems, even kids know some of these things are stupid. I watched this with my little cousin and he was just bored. HE FELL ASLEEP. And i asked him if he knows anybody who goes to school on christmas eve. he said no. TERRIBLE. WORST FILM EVER. The Emoji Movie > 48 Christmas Wishes"
tt7422638,"It is like sitting through a school play for your friend's kids - no reason to be here if you really don't have to be. From the first minutes where a 20+ plays the mom to a teenage girl the acting is worse than the casting. If you really feel the need, turn it on and you too will realize after 5 minutes you need to check your cell and create a reason to excuse yourself."
tt7422638,"Horrible acting, script and effects. The room is better than this movie."
tt7422638,"This movie seems to resonate with young audiences, and you could easily watch as a whole family. For this, this movie doesn't deserve the super low reviews. Sure, adult viewers will scratch their heads at the acting, but the movie is wholesome and the kids are cute to watch (especially little Cam the elf).The movie has two main plots, a family trying to find the joy of Christmas again after the death of a parent, and a second one about some elves trying to find Christmas wishes they lost from the family's small town. The elves and kids help each other find and bring happiness to the holiday."
tt7422638,"Dear All,
I couldn't help myself submitting this review. Despite all the negativeness going on nowadays, I just wanted to cheer up by watching noel movies. All the movies made my day one way or another. Regardless of all the negative comments(which I agree) , I gave it a shot. I kept watching persistently since the first minute. But after minutes passed, it became impossible for me not to notice the 'probably' cheap plastic ears on the players acting as elves. After half an hour, I could only see nothing else but the cheap, sloppy mounted plastic ears. So,briefly, if you're over 12 y.o., don't watch the movie.However, the story of the film gives positive message.
Best Regards,"
tt7422638,"Very cute and wholesome. I think with some coaching most of these actors could be pretty good. The sets were fcute and the kids super-cute. I think only the actress playing Laura is a professional actress . But I really liked this movie! No potty humor, nice storyline, I really wanted to see how it would end. A lot of people gave it poor reviews but these lower budget movies are more like plays. No highly paid actors or special effects, just fun to watch like a play might be. I would definitely watch another filmby this company. No I am not relatex to anyone in it--I just like good wholesome stuff!"
tt7422638,"This movie was cute. I laughed out loud a couple of times. The highlight was definitely the elves interacting with the humans. The story with the human family was the weaker part. I think this was a good production for the budget, but the premise is so good and has so much potential that I'm sorry it wasn't turned into a major Christmas release."
tt7422638,"A mess of a film that would be a good ""do not"" example on so many levels for a film school program. (Or a what is Canadian? Lesson in anthropology.)Camera setups, lighting, pacing, directing the actors, really everything. The widowed mom is cute at least. Seems like it was shot in a busy Canadian afternoon. My 8 year old enjoyed it though. Meanwhile I'm stunned to see them use a take in a climactic scene where the actor's face goes in and out of focus in the middle of a static shot. Perfect example of Canadian lighting. Every bit of scenery is lit, As in, no shadows at all to obscure the cheesy sets. And everyone is so Canadian, the whitest white people ever. Amazing."
tt12427840,"There are children's shows you can watch with your kid not nearly as torturous as this show. The Wiggles, Octonauts, Word Party are a few. Cocomelon is BY FAR the lowest effort, brain-melting experience you could give your child. They basically use 5 royalty free songs with SLIGHTLY different lyrics each time, lyrics like ""yes yes yes, peas are good for you. Ha-ha-ha, I like them oooh."" You could torture POWs with it."
tt12427840,"Ok, let me start by saying I absolutely cannot believe that I've seen this show enough time to even warrant a review. But, low and behold here we are.. As an adult I find Cocomelon to be the most annoying show known to mankind especially given how many times I've had to sit through every single episode. From a film student perspective the animation is poor and their really isn't any originality within Cocomelon. From a dad perspective my 1 year old son absolutely loves it and it keeps him occupied sometimes for hours at a time and gives me and my fiance a break so hey, at least theres that. Its meant for babies and babies love it so I guess it does what it's supposed too"
tt12427840,"Even though I'm not the target audience for this show, that doesn't mean it can't be judged by older people.Cocomelon is an annoying recycled content purely made just to grab the ad revenue from the cheapest budgets. Some young kids will find the fun in this but not for me.That doesn't mean that you shouldn't watch these YouTube videos, it's something to have your toddler get addicted to and have your kid get distracted for half an hour or two.It's easy to hate Cocomelon but normally it's best to just let this thing go unhinged and try to avoid it as much as possible.It's nothing surprising to find a low rating for this kind of movie and whether you would want your kid to watch to is subjective depending on what you want for them, but it just doesn't offer much and it will likely continue that way."
tt12427840,"Overstimulating mind melting dribble. By far the worst show targeted for kids. You're kids mind is a sponge in the early years. If you want to give your kids a head start avoid this at all costs. If they absolutely need to watch TV between 1 and 5 years old. Superivise them, look up: bluey, Sarah and duck, the wiggles or watch some Disney movies."
tt12427840,"I hate this show, the character design is awful, especially the monkey one, Quick flashlights, and for top it, the songs' voice is awful!Animation 2/10Characters 0/10 (Because Of The Monkey's Design)Voice Acting 5/10Musical Theme 3/10."
tt12427840,"Cocomelon is the worst thing I've ever seen at least as far as something claiming to be entertaining goes. The same nursery rhymes are sung over and over in ever worsening voices. The animations look horrible and generic.Cocomelon and Little Baby Bum are the lowest form of children's entertainment. There are so many better things to keep babies and toddlers happy. Just off the top of my head, I would recommend Caspar Babypants, Hey Bear Sensory, Steve and Maggie, literally anything else.How people are rating this 10 is beyond me. Yeah, it might keep your little ones quiet for a while but it genuinely feels like it would rot their brains.Horrendous."
tt12427840,"It's one of the worst Kids Shows I've ever seen. Worst CGI, worst Animation & worst graphics. Only babies love this dribble. I give it a big fat zero!!!"
tt12427840,"Why do people have a deep hate for Cocomelon?Because it's annoying recycled content that goes on forever and milks the heck out of baby shark. Yes it's for kids, but I have to listen to it too.. I'd rather listen to Blimpie.. The only plus is it's not Ryan."
tt12427840,"Although as an adult I find it annoying, my son LOVES IT. Hes memorized when its on and it lets me cook without him clinging to my leg!"
tt12427840,"Okay, now don't get me wrong, I'm a teen and I really shouldn't be watching this. But young kids, particularly ones under the age of 6 really deserve better content to watch and Cocomelon isn't that.My first flaw with the show is that the animation is way too slow. I mean compared to another CGI show aimed at young children such as Ready Jet Go, which has faster animation, is much more interesting to watch and contains much better CGI. Which leads to my next issue with Cocomelon.Secondly, the CGI is very vapid and resembles more like a shovelware PS1/Nintendo 64 game more than an actual show compared to other shows aimed at the same audience. I mean you'll see a huge difference when you compare Cocomelon with another CGI show like another popular preschool show (in this case, PAW Patrol). Unlike Cocomelon, PAW Patrol has pretty decent CGI and you can tell they took the time to animate the show rather than rushing to produce something that makes Bubsy 3D look like Super Mario Galaxy in comparison.My third and quite possibly the most obvious flaw with this show is that is this show is simply for ""kids only"". What makes most preschool shows I like (namely, Sesame Street, Bluely, Alphablocks, and Cyberchase) is that those shows know that parents will be watching it with them instead of being something that'll distract an a child via over-stimulants.Final Words: It's not good. Not the worst preschool show out there, but parents are better off looking for something produced by a company that puts effort into their shows such as Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount, Sesame Workshop, WildBrain, Nelvana, PBS, or BBC. The only thing that's keeping it from having a 1/10 is that it IS slightly educational to give it credit."
tt12427840,My 18 month old daughter loves when we put CocoMelon on for her. The songs are simple and cute and the family (although a bit creepy to us adults) are sweet and cute. Not sure why it's gotten such bad reviews - it's your typical preschool nursery rhyme show.
tt12427840,"Ignore the bad reviews. Judging this show from a ""film students"" perspective is the most ridiculous thing I've heard. The show is fantastic for babies and I'm not sure why others are saying it ""makes kids dumb"" and ""teaches bad habits"". The point of this show is to entertain babies and begin to teach them basic things in the form of songs. It is repetitive so that they can retain the information, and the animation is slow and bulky because babies cannot process fast moving things. Overall great show and makes my 1 year old happy. If it bores you as an adult then play on your phone like we all know you're doing anyways..."
tt12427840,"My kids asked me to put Cocomelon on for them when they saw the graphic on Netflix. I can honestly say that this is my biggest regret as a parent ever. So bad in fact that I may never allow them to select anything ever again.If you made this in your spare time, just for fun, then I suppose I wouldn't mind (and I'd be happy for you!) but since this is available on mainstream platforms I think it's fair to offer a real critique.CocoMelon is awful. The voices, the animations, each episode's nonstop nature - these factors all combine into a headache inducing horror show that I wouldn't wish on anyone.Just sing with your kids, play with them, give them toys, and, if they absolutely must watch TV, give them something more entertaining than this.This horrible, hypnotic content is just bad. Really bad. Everything CocoMelon does is done better elsewhere."
tt12427840,"In the dystopian universe of WALL-E, THIS is the program that beams into children's brains as they rot into oblivion. I write music for a living, but hearing these ""songs"" makes me want to gouge out my eardrums and pray for a universe where music never existed."
tt12427840,"This show is bad in one scene they sing about washing their hear and one of the kids did not even have hair and he was in that very scene.It's really bad and one of the worst show I have ever watched and it is one of the worst things that you can place in a small child's mind. My advice just don't make them watch it you should not watch it. I have one use for it, an torture device."
tt12427840,"I've seen a couple of very negative reviews for this sweet, innocent show. I'm thinking some may be turned off because the stories portray an average family where the parents love their children and vice versa.
It's a simple concept that's designed to entertain young children, which it does. When my 2-year-old grandson watches, he's not looking for Pavarotti from Carnegie Hall or the dramatic readings from Jsmes Earl Jones.
Evidently, he's looking for exactly what this show has to offer. It's the only show he asks for by name."
tt12427840,"Cocomelon... oh boy, how can I explain how much I absolutely hate this YouTube Kids Cartoon?So, the franchise focuses on mainly babies, the main one being JJ. Nursery Rhymes play over and over again, and that's pretty much it.Now, for my verdict on the franchise:· Characters - they are as flat as a pancake and have absolutely no personality whatsoever.· Songs - they're the same exact nursery rhymes you hear anywhere else and they repeat over and over again, enough to drive any older person insane.· CGI animation - It's average at best, full of colour to bait toddlers.· Plotline - What plotline? All it is are nursery rhymes, pretty much what LittleBabyBum already offers.· The morals - There are absolutely no morals whatsoever in Cocomelon, and this is one of the major reasons why I dislike this YouTube cartoon.· Is it worthwhile for Kids? - No, absolutely not. It's milked everywhere by Moonbug Entertainment and now it's airing on TV as well. Please... get it off television, Netflix and keep it on YouTube Kids. And parents, actually spend time with your kids rather than using this show as the babysitter, or put something else on that actually teaches educational values and morals - such as Bluey, or Sesame Street. Heck, even Peppa Pig has some educational values despite how flawed that show is.Overall, I do not recommend any parent to discover this show and let the show brainwash their toddlers."
tt12427840,"Remember 20 years ago, maybe even 10 when when we and other children at the time watched actual entertainment instead of this and skibidi toilet. This is perhaps the most mind melting from of ""entertainment"" I have ever seen. I feel bad for the kids who grow up with this. For starters the animation looks like it had a five pound budget, then it's the same tune over and over again. Next is next to no effort into making it bearable for the other people in the room. Remember when our parents would put on Peppa pig or SpongeBob squarepants and occasionally they would sit down for a minute and watch. Times have changed, Times have changed."
tt12427840,"If the next generation of kids ends up as a group of daft, window licking mouth breathers, then I am fairly sure Cocomelon is the cause for patient zero and the start of the dumbpocalpyse.It is tone deaf, lacks any type of musicality/educational content, never rhymes and often relies on recycled and outdated tunes that make parents worldwide pray for the sun's solar radiation to send us back to the dark ages.Guaranteed to stunt a child's development and increase parental alcohol consumption. I would recommend this for simps who enjoy suffering or for CIA agents who need a tactic to extract information from captives (half an episode should be all they need to crack even the most hardened terrorist).If Helen Keller was still alive, she would likely be asking to be deafer and blinder to avoid this vomit-inducing garbage."
tt12427840,"My kid loves this show...the opening scene with the watermelon and ladybug always puts a smile on his face. I understand this show is for kids, NOT adults, and it serves its purpose well. The music and story lines are simple, educational, positive, fun for kids and repurposes/reimagines classic nursery rhymes. Don't expect Pixar animation but you can expect your young children to enjoy what Cocomelon has to offer."
tt12427840,This is not good at all! Just a big corporation taking advantage of parents who let the TV and YouTube raise their kids!
tt12427840,"We first started watching Cocomellon on YouTube. My kids (now 2 and 4) have loved watching ""babies"" as they call it, for a while now. Most songs are familiar favorites and some are new, to us, and we love them. Very catchy and fun to sing in the car."
tt12427840,"Question: Who is jay jeon? Creator of cocomelon? He's not even credited anywhere! I cannot find him anywhere in the internet either and I find that super weird lol.Show is nice though but...
I get sad when this show shows the kids doing super fun, cool things with their parents and having a backyard full of adventures...we don't have any of that :( maybe someday though. Not even the fun family days at the beach. It's just me and my 2 daughters and my youngest watches this show sometimes but I feel bad when I can tell she wants to do the same things JJ wants to. It's ok though for now. We still have good times together (me and my girls) even without the big house with bikes and fun family outings. Whatever lol."
tt12427840,"Monotonic annoying voices that Will make your kids the dumbest before they reach school, vary BADLY animated with weired restricted movements. Made for lazy parents and aware génération, a disasterous cartoon setting on Netflix.what a world de live in. What a shame."
tt12427840,"It represents the perfect option for the education of preschool kids. Easy songs, nice drawings, energetic stories and nice lessons about ordinary behaviors. And ,for adults, good opportunity for discover the change of generations. The lyrics are not the most inspired, at the first sigh, but the freshness of stories and the delicate humor are just good points ."
tt0938283,"They went too fast and all the characters talk like they're reading off placards. The computer generated stuff was good though but i got less than what i expected. What a waste of time and money. I'd rather had stayed home and watched the original cartoon instead.The original cartoon is ten times better to watch. Even if i consider this movie as a unit in it itself, its missing a lot of story where a new viewer wouldn't be able to connect the points. Although it has good computer generated animation and stuff but you still get less than you'd expect. There are bits where you expect it to be funny and it ain't, no fun. Anybody who has watched the original cartoon will tell you how much of it they have skipped in the beginning of the movie. The story line is completely shot, you cant tell whats really going on."
tt0938283,"M. Night's career as a director has been spiraling downwards ever since The Sixth Sense, we can all agree. But on The Last Airbender, his most recent major project, his credibility simply plummeted.You know that embarrassing feeling you get when you're watching an amateur movie? Yeah, you'll get a lot of that if you spend your money to watch this in the theaters, which is ill-advised. The Last Airbender simply had no direction, and the script flopped around aimlessly to try and wrap up an entire season of the animated TV show, Avatar (which it is based off of), in 103 minutes. The dialogue was appalling and the poor development of story made audience members moan and groan. An entire love relationship is created with the single, randomly narrated line of, ""They became friends very quickly"", while two characters who have just met allot the other a generous five second stare each. Embarrassing scriptwriting such as this is what caused the failing of The Last Airbender. This was NOT helped by the mediocre acting performances of Noah Ringer, Nicola Peltz, and Seychelle Gabriel.Poor acting, poor scripting, poor directing. What was there to like? Sadly the action sequences, few and far between, are hardly engaging enough to satisfy any moviegoer's appetite, for lack of other elements. I was told by friends that while the movie stayed true to the general plot of the animated TV series, the action was poorly represented. Underpowered, and a bit superfluous in movement, the much needed fight scenes became almost tedious to watch.The world of Avatar was curious; I'll give it that. The environment with the four elemental nations, each with its own unique race, which far from appearing racist, was actually one of the few ideas that made the movie... somewhat interesting.A general question continued to run through my mind... It was almost as if M. Night thought to himself, ""What is the LEAST I could do with my budget?"" And I think he found the perfect answer with The Last Airbender.I award M. Night's latest masterpiece in his spiraling antics a generous 4/10."
tt0938283,"I watched this reluctantly for the first time recently to see if it was bad as I had heard and I was wrong, it was even worse than I could have imagined. I was unable to even finish the movie. I wish I could rate it lower. I understand that adaptations are difficult to reflect in the same light as the original content but the direction style, casting, writing, acting, and animation of this movie was lazy, disrespectful, and devalued the core ideals of the series. The movie proves painful to watch. I grew up watching the series and still now as an adult I am still constantly in awe of how wonderful of a show it is. So I wholeheartedly recommend to forget you even laid eyes on this movie and go watch the series in all it's glory."
tt0938283,I remember watching this movie back when it first came out and I didn't think it was that bad. I just finished watching the cartoon series on Netflix and I figured I would re-watch this to wrap it all up. Now I wish I hadn't watched it. It's NOTHING like the show. I wonder if the people who worked on this movie even saw the show. Stay away from this movie. It's so bad that it actually hurts to watch it.
tt0938283,"Shyamalan takes a stunningly sophisticated cartoon and reduces it to one of the most insultingly dumb films I've seen in years. From the script to the visuals, the directing, the acting, there is absolutely nothing that did well, either as an adaptation or as a film in its own right.Characters who were once powerful and spitfire (Katara) or entertainingly sarcastic (Sokka) are now bland and exist solely for the purpose of exposition. In fact, the entire film comes off as exposition, far too much of the dialog serving as ""by the way"" explanations, never allowing the plot or characters to really take form. The scenes seem episodic and unconnected, and the film never comfortably establishes its universe, always retreading with an ""as you know"" or ""aren't you that guy who..."" to establish (often unnecessary) continuity.The style, too, is disappointing, capturing none of the magic of the series. Most noticeable was the ""bending""--while the series took its martial arts seriously, carefully aligning real-world arts with elements and making the benders' movements coincide with those of their elements, the film gives us characters flailing in generic martial arts forms for a few minutes, only to effect one splash, boulder, or blast of fire. In the series, every movement had a meaning; in the film, only about one in ten does.Many fans of the series who were angry at the ""whitewashing"" of the cast hoped that it had at least resulted in the best actors for the parts. However, the acting was at best uninspired, and at worst painfully awkward, though part of this can be attributed to a truly atrocious script. Dialog is stilted and unnatural, certain phrases are repeated needlessly throughout (""great library,"" anyone?), and in all the only chance the script stands of being remembered is through memetic appreciation of its unintentional, awkward hilarity.Not even the collective will of a devoted fanbase wanting so much for this film to be good could make it even remotely watchable."
tt0938283,"No story, no history, absolutely dreadful script and acting that is frankly despicable. You can't write. You can't make up a world arbitrarily with no fleshing or effort. The Happening and Lady in the Water were terrible. This is much worse.Shame on you you lazy lazy man. The talent is there. Your ego is simply unable to get past it. Go away and let someone hungry and brave who doesn't live in a fantasy world in their own nether-regions produce something.You owe me my ticket and the complete waste of one and a half hours of my life. Tosser"
tt0938283,"Let me just say I'm not the big Avatar fan like my son and daughter are but I am aware of the show and have seen some episodes so when I sat down for the screening I really didn't have any expectations. So I am coming at this movie not as a raging fan but a fan of film and there are elements of the film that I really liked and others that I did not. First the bad. The child actor who played Aang was really not that good, but also the script for him was also not very good. Stilted dialog will do that and it really is a shame because the bending parts and martial art scenes the kid is quite good. The other two kid actors are really not given much to do, the girl is so-so and her brother looked like he could have done something with the role but for the most part was relegated to the back. Also there are some continuity gaps in the film that kinda make you go huh? Plus and this is a good-bad thing the movie only runs about 90min and I truly would have liked to see the movie run a little longer. There are some great scenes with the Firebender banished prince and his uncle and a scene with Saka and the princess about her blonde hair that makes you look at the screen and go yes, but then there are parts where the film is rushed to get to the action. And now the good. I'm glad to say the action in the movie is really well done. The SFX are very good and very organic so they don't stand out at you and go look FX. Also the action isn't all cut up MTV style. M.Night chose to film some of the action in long full shot takes and I truly enjoyed those elements. As for fans of the show I think it will be a mixed bag. I think the movie should have used Asian actors and dealt with the relationships more but on the whole if I could I'd really give this movie a 6.5. It's one of those movies that could have been really good, but just misses the mark. Plus save your money and if you see it see it in 2D. The 3D adds nothing."
tt0938283,"After all the bad press thrown at ""The last air-bender"" i was expecting something horrific. Is it a bad film? Well according to my standards no. Definitely not. I will by the number what i liked and what i thought was weak.1. The actions scenes. They are wonderfully done and choreographed and since M.Night Shyalaman has used us with nice camera work, his style is clearly visible from the first shot. He has an eye for some of the most poetic fights i've seen in my life. The use also of slow motion is just phenomenal.2. The production scale. This is a film truly at a similar spectacular scope of ""Lord of the rings"" and ""Star Wars"". Besides the wonderful locations such as Greenland, the sets are just freaking massive and filled with amazing details. I was so impressed when i saw the throne room of Lord Ozai. The iced palace of the Northern water tribe, with small water falls and well crafted zen lakes, i have no words to describe its beauty. 3. The visuals. The whole film proceeds like a poem. It is so easy to watch and even if you do not care about the story, you just gaze the locations. i haven't felt like that since i saw Zang Yimou's ""Hero"". The addition of crystal clear and eye popping effects from Industrial Light and Magic just add extra points in this visual feast.4. The benders of the natural elements. That was something i have never seen before and as an idea is pretty much interesting to see how it will is represented on screen. This is a good idea that can produce various action-hell yes-scenes.5. The cast-OK i know this is a controversial choice but i thought the avatar child actor wasn't that bad but neither that good. Dev Patel as prince Zuko and Shaun Toub as General Iroh are awesome. Their performances are adequate and believable. I really like the relationship between these two and the way Zuko feels. 7. James Newton Howard's music. An excellent soundtrack that captures the main theme of the film.So these are the positive things i found. Now, i will mention five things i did not like.1. The duration. i mean for such a rich and expensive mythology, i would expected a full 2 hour, maybe +, film. Instead i am getting the usual 1/40 hours maximum minutes, including the credits..2. ...which brings me to my second main point. The film looks rushed. Not rushed in terms of production, but rushed as a story. There is no room to have proper acting scenes. Usually most of the film contains dialog about things that have occurred or will happened but they last 2 minutes each. We do not know how long our heroes are staying in the palace of the Northern water tribe.3. The film is trimmed! All the character development scenes have been erased for the sake of entertainment. There are so many moments where i felt like that. I wanted to know more. This reminds another case such as ""Clash of the titans"". People blasted the film however, they did not blasted the Hollywood machine for screwing over its directors. To cut from a film almost an hour to increase in market appeal is a horrible act. If you have seen the trailers, you will notice that half actually of the scenes in the trailers are not in the film! Lame..4... because this is great material. The mythology is rich and its good to see a new world so unbelievably stunning. The characters are intriguing but there is no explanation behind their motives. 5. Finally, major problem is the existence of narration while the camera is traveling or moving. You get to see the kids flying in the air and the girl narrates to us ""we were flying in the air...."". Then they land to the northern water tribe palace and bowing to the king.... ""and we bowed to the king"". I mean i can see that! There is no point for narration unless you want to explain something to your audience.6. The only major difference between the series and the film adaptation is the level of seriousness. In the cartoon, while everyone was so brave, there are hilarious jokes and one liners that ""bend"" the ice (see what i did there?). The series delivered tones of excitement and fun. Aang-the avatar-is a 12 year old boy who is just discovering his powers and is aiming mostly to have fun! Unfortunately, in the film, Aang is mostly or trying to be at least, dramatic. There is no time for fun and that's why perhaps people blasted it. If you apply the above feeling to the whole movie, the atmosphere is different. The film takes itself too seriously and leaves no room for funny acts or scenes. While personally i am not annoyed, if you try to make your film look serious, then implement more scenes to explain your characters motivations, feelings and actions. To conclude, one small reference about the spirit world. In the series it is established from episode to episode but in the film, individuals are just talking about it rather than showing it or at least explaining something!It is such a shame because i loved the visual feast that this adaptation has to offer but i can see the trimming parts coming from a mile away. I really like the film that's why it has an 8/10 but I felt it could do so much more! I do hope in the future Shyalaman will restore the movie into its full glory. So this was ""The last air bender"". Maybe Hollywood learned its lesson about storytelling and 3D conversion process and in the sequel we will get more of the good stuff."
tt0938283,"As someone who just wanted to see this film purely from the captivating trailers, I was definitely not disappointed. No, I've never seen the series, so my review is purely one of THE FILM as just that - a film. And I, my husband, and my sister (we are all adults,) LOVED it.The cinematography was truly stunning - the CGI water effects were magnificent! The fight scenes were also very well choreographed (especially the one with Aang and the ""Blue Spirit,"") and the Tai Chi based forms were gracefully fluid. The boy's technique was spot on!The action was very well done without going over the top, and the dramatic aspects stemming from the various relationships is extremely intriguing. The relationships: between the father/son, the uncle/nephew, and especially the one between Aang and Prince Zuko - they are all wonderfully illustrated and executed, creating the right amount of tension, give, and conflict.We were so pleased with this film's ending and are happily waiting for the sequel! For those of you out there, like us, who do NOT watch this cartoon series (the adult population out there) GO SEE THIS FILM. You will be taken away from your everyday life into a time and place beyond your wildest dreams, and you WILL be entertained."
tt0938283,"After waiting extremely eagerly for this movie, I sat in the theater and was extremely eager for it to END. Ear-oh? Oong? Soak-ah?! Could they have butchered the names anymore than they did? Worse, the entire movie felt like a string of clips put together for an hour and a half and not like a movie at all. All the major parts of the Book of Water were skimmed over, while things like the freeing of the earth nation village (while important) were given screen time that could have been given to major events like the southern air temple.The actors were dismal, with the exception of Dev Patel as Zuko and to a lesser extent Shaun Toub as Iroh, who wasn't an accurate portrayal of Iroh visually but at least captured the character's wisdom much better than many of the other actors on board for the movie. He however failed to provide many of the aspects of Iroh that made him endearing in the series.I will give that the northern water kingdom was gorgeous, but that's about all I have to say kindly about this movie.If you love Avatar: The Last Airbender as the series, I recommend giving this movie a miss. It's heartbreaking how they butchered something that had such fantastic and barely needing change source material."
tt0938283,"I went into the movie knowing it would not be even a fraction as good as the real show. However, I didn't know that would make me literally want to leave the theater in the middle of the very movie. How someone could do such damage in approximately an hour and forty minutes is entirely beyond me. It was ridiculous, the only way to describe it is a $150 million dollar failure. I could understand if the effects were not up to par but the biggest disappointment was the acting. It was so stiff and it never once felt like the actors meant a word they were saying. I caught a glimpse of an interview with Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone on TV and even their approach to that felt so wrong. It felt kind of disgusting to see as I've lately been watching Avatar: The Last Airbender (with extras) almost religiously for the past month.The script in itself should have been tossed into the garbage and burnt and it's remains locked away so that no one would ever have to suffer looking at such garbage. That's why I'm not really sure if it's the actors or the script that's really to blame for the atrocious ""movie"" that's resulted. The long and, I'm assuming this what they were going for, ""inspirational"" speeches merely consisted of crudely strung together clichés and the language left much to be desired. I found myself almost twitching at the phrase (something along the lines) ""You guys are AWESOME people!""...What I find the be so incredibly amazing is how someone could honestly fail to such a proportion when they literally have a blue print already created. The fans know how the characters look and sound and while I understand that no one fits the package perfectly one out of two would be better than nothing. As well, suddenly deciding to change the pronunciation of the characters name is definitely not the best idea, while I do understand that he wanted the names to sound like their Asian origin, it didn't go over well and the whole time I was just cringing at the mere mention of Aang and Sokka's names.This movie does not hold a candle to the original show. Heck, it should be retitled as it is hardly resembles the original in any way shape or form. While I do realize that not all episodes can be featured, the sequence of events just left you feeling awkward and confused. I, also, loathed the way they worked the bending in like it took five minutes of moving ones hands around awkwardly before any actual bending occurred. Most of the fighting was like fifteen minutes of martial arts with like the occasional bit of air bending and a little water being splashed around.There was nothing to love in this movie not even the most adorable of characters such as Momo. Momo had literally what three minutes in the entire movie which I found extremely depressing as Momo was always one of the characters I just wanted to cuddle because of his adorable mannerisms but in the movie I had no love for the digitized Momo. Not even Appa was interesting.This movie leaves me hoping and praying that M. Night Shyamalan goes broke and is black listed so that he can't ruin the series even more so. This is definitely something you will spend some time just trying to forget."
tt0938283,"I walked into this movie with pretty low expectations. I didn't expect something as good as the cartoon, I didn't expect a perfect adaptation. I expected some glitzy action sequences, cheap emotional ploys, just some fun summer fair.What did I get? A movie so indescribably horrible I can only shake my head in bewilderment. Believe the critics. The writing sucks, the acting is stiff, the pacing clumsy, the 3-D beyond bad, the overall tone way too dark and brooding. Not much here is salvageable.Obviously Shyamalan got completely caught up in the mythology of the world and missed the fact that what made the original cartoon so great were the CHARACTERS. Of which there are none in this film.But really, even just a competently produced film would have been nice. And it almost was. The music was great. The special effects looked amazing, I don't care what anyone says. The fighting was cool. The sets were adequately spectacular. Indeed, it appears the only one who didn't show up for work was Shyamalan. While the adult actors manage to find their way somewhat on their own, the poor kids are obviously lost without someone competently leading them, they spend most of the film in a bewildered daze. Even some of the background extras acted awkwardly. But of course, there are no real survivors of Shyamalan's CLUNKER of a script. I can't believe someone didn't stop this guy. There were maybe two scenes that didn't sound awkward, and they had no dialog. I don't think any film has ever been such a disaster due to one man's gross ineptitude.Such a shame. It could have been so good."
tt0938283,"Hi! I would like to start off by saying that I watched the Last Airbender during it's original run on T.V. and loved it! When the show officially ended I found myself wishing that it wouldn't. After all: I had grown to love the characters. Why would I want to say goodbye?When the Last Airbender came to theaters I looked it up and read the reviews. My expectations were dropped in the mud.80% or so rated it as being somewhere between totally heretical and just plain abysmal. You can imagine my disappointment.Even after that stark dose of reality I was hopeful and so with a cloud over my head I ventured to my local cinema to experience either an extreme disaster or a surprising revival of a loved cartoon. Thankfully the latter met me at the theater.I've not seen any of Shyamalan's other films so I don't know how to rate it against them but on It's own I give it a 7 out of 10.I thoroughly enjoyed the acting (even though it was a little substandard at times), the humor, the choreography and the special effects. Nothing bad about any of it. I do, however feel that whoever gave the script the final O.K. should have gone through it again and given it a good streamlining. A few more pronouns would have gone a long way toward making it sound more intelligent.The changed pronunciation of some the names didn't bother me much. After all, America is one of the few (if not the only) countries in the world that actually uses the hard 'A' sound. How likely would it be that they would in the Last Airbender universe?All in all I think the movie accomplished very nicely what it set out to do. It took a whole season of a hit cartoon show and condensed it down to just under 2 hours.If they had chosen to make it twenty minutes longer they could have worked in some more character development and made the segue from scene to scene less abrupt.All in all, it is a highly enjoyable movie that I - a stead fast fan of the original series - would love to watch again.If you choose to see it I recommend doing so with an open mind and perhaps this thought in the back of your head: No adaptation is ever the same as the original work. Otherwise, what would be the point?"
tt2407826,"If you have watched Happy Husbands, then you can confirm this being worse than that.Performances by all the reputed actors is shameful. There's no character in them. Not a single one has a credible character plot. The story is rubbish and clichéd. The screenplay is so feeble that at first, you will realize your neck is paining.The music is copied from various movies, domestic & international, including from native Casanovva (Mohanlal starrer flop).There is no point in the movie since the beginning and after intermission, you feel pain in other body parts. To be frank, HIG is a no-show and SHOULD BE AVOIDED!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESLanguage: No (Double meaning statements, yes) Sex: No Nudity: No Mouth-Kiss: No Violence: No"
tt2407826,"There's been enough movies of this genre in Hindi and in Malayalam. It seems like no one learns from how poorly they do.What a waste of time, air, space, and electricity. I wonder how much they paid these ""reputed"" actors to act in such a trite, clichéd, not-funny-even-50-years-ago kind of script where they simply play caricatures of mindless men.The script has no respect for men, women, husbands, and wives, makes a mockery out of Indian culture.Save your energy and watch literally ANYTHING else."
tt2407826,"Very vulgar movie with no story,demeaning women and hinduism."
tt2407826,It's a late review. But I have to say it. Its a light hearted fun ride. There are a lot of hilarious scenes in the movie. The story is kept simple but the way the movie says it is very funny. It's a complete entertainer.
tt0114031,"This movie is an ambitious daring film for its time. Although the whole story and dialog is reminiscent with a theatrical (broadway like) play where costumes, symbolic acts, and singing dialogs reveal the story. It must have been extremely hard to orchestrate into a film, and unfortunately with little success. The nice thing about this film is that symbolism is well crafted and touch upon relevant issues in every country but mostly India. I started noticing the symbolism in simple things attributed in the movie which shows the director's appeal for an intellectual audience. Another nice thing is that the film makes use of Shah Rukh Khan's exuberant energy in a satisfying manner. The acting was well for the genre of the film, but very theatrical like and at times you feel the un comfortable switch between screen and theater actors which makes it hard to move through scenes. The songs are bad but its inevitable when many critical story and thematic words are being used. Deepa Sahi is not the perfect choice to pair with Shah Rukh. She constantly looks like his mother rather than his love interest. She can't carry the character at all and over-does it many times. Their pairing in the two movies they did together must have been of the worst i have ever seen for Shah Rukh.. and i have seen them all. But i guess she is the director's favorite (or upper hand) and i can't think of another actress for the film, but i know any younger, more Indian girl would have been better. Many actors in this movie are recognizable as supporting role actors, so this film must have been a break in their struggling period. This is a somewhat black comedy but it is not a comedy. Its an over dramatized to fantastical measures to fit the critical issues it is addressing. Overall, it is worth a watch if you like Shah Rukh Khan, symbolic films, or a brief encounter with India's struggle for life is an artistic way."
tt0114031,"Shah Rukh Khan (SRK) and Deepa Sahi play mango (aam) couple who save India from getting sold off in a live auction organised by a fake President of India.With a plot as bizzare as this, Oh Darling Yeh Hai India had no chance at the box office when it released way back in 1995. I had seen the film at Bandra's Gemini cinema and was probably amongst the very few who found it fun!!Conceived by Deepa Sahi, Oh Darling..'s satirical tone and sarcastic humour is unique in its own way. The entire film occurs in single night and we actually get to see the sunlight only in the ending scene. Director Ketan Mehta tried to structure the narrative like a musical so you had a song practically every five minutes specially in the first half. Ranjit Barot's tunes were peppy and the title song and the 'Baap re baap' number became quite popular.Of the cast, SRK was brilliant as the nameless struggler while Javed Jaffrey was rocking as the son of Don. Deepa Sahi was equally impressive playing a prostitute who wants to let her hair down the whole night. Her chemistry with SRK was just as sizzling as it was in Maya Memsaab (though admittedly, she looked older than him on screen).The highlight of the film ofcourse, was the late Amrish Puri playing Don Quixote.""Gazab Khopdi Don Kihote"" was his catchphrase. Oh Darling...was just as Ajab and Gazab as that character!!"
tt0114031,"I think it was a great fun film because it was India's first farce. It was refreshing as it was different from the usual predictable movies with cardboard characters and in fact won many awards in Bengal. Indians who have a sense of humor loved it..so will you!Also Javed Jaffery and Shahrukh were great.Ketan Mehta is an interesting director and likes to experiment with his films, so it is always a pleasure to see what he will come up with next.Deepa Sahi too is a good change from the usual Hindi filmy style of acting. She dares to be different each time. Though people accused the film I hear of being anti nationalist, if you look closely it isn't at all. In fact it tries to say how some vested interests are hawking off the country!"
tt0114031,"Although one of the songs was good, the movie was a disaster.  The storyline line was..actually no storyline.  There is not semantic of this movie.  If anyone would want to watch this movie, go an pick something else but this. The villains existed in this movie but the problem with this movie movie was that the regulars like Shah Rukh Khan and Anupam Kher were all brought to shame and looked like as if they were the skeleton of the real actors.  I have seen it once and never again.  There is no language in this movie."
tt0114031,"This might be the craziest, wildest, weirdest Indian movie ever. The story takes place all in a single night. There are clones, disintegrating gun, clones disintegrated to skeletons, India (the whole country) being sold off in an auction to the highest bidder, women beating men with their breasts and pony tails, using national flags as a murder weapon as well as a parachute, a character exploding by being inflated with water from a hose. It is wild.This is one of Amrish Puri's best turns as the villain. Gajab khopdi Don Quixote 💀
Javed Jaffrey is a surprise and he and SRK's character have a dance-off. Yes, there are song and dance numbers in this.I honestly say it deserves a watch for things you may never witness in any other film ever.Spoiler:I believe the person they killed with water hose was the real President. They unintentionally saved the clone instead. It is left ambiguous in the film because oh darling, ye hai India!"
tt0114031,"When this movie released in 1995, its no surprise it found no takers with a plot as bizarre as this the songs were mediocre at best except maybe one or two , I found myself humming Baap re Baap in the market the next day. I surprisingly enjoyed the movie and it was good fun and a refreshing watch. Although I enjoyed it I think you should only watch it for something different plus also for the brilliant performances given by Jaaved Jaaferi, Shah Rukh Khan, and Anupam Kher, if you're a fan of parodies you might find yourself pleasantly surprised , however if you like conventional movies stay away!"
tt2251275,"Imagine a few people doing a sort of radio play and then putting on some generic low quality 3D animation where some characters need to have a mask because there is no budget for different and moving human faces. Nothing is explained or makes any sense, everything is chaotic and dreamlike. Maybe there is some smart idea coming out of this mess later in the film, but I couldn't watch more than 15 minutes before I decided I can't continue."
tt2251275,"I've never seen such a horrible movie in all my quite-respectably-long life. There wasn't a single word of dialog worth hearing, not a single camera angle worth viewing, not a single beam of proper lighting, in this whole nightmare - not a nightmare in the usual frightening sense, but in the imprisoned-with-an-under-achieving-insurance-agent for all eternity sense. I can't say it any better than that, nor do I have any further words to add, IMDB. I've lost respect for your site because you've allowed a rating of 4+ to stand. The sole viewer who gave this piece of offal a 10 I leave to your own tormentuous and apparently completely-tasteless life. Enjoy!"
tt2251275,"This movie has a few problems.1. The graphics. It's made fully digitally, and very cheaply too. It can be seen in design, unnatural or mostly repetetive movements (forest run isna good example), face mimic animation, use of masks to avoid animating them, use of assets that look like freebies downloaded from the internet. I can see a massive amount of work put in here, but it hadn't gone well.2. Camera work. Constant usenof a shaky ""disturbing"" camera. Why the actual f..k would someone decide to do that? It's horrible and as far as I get that it was meant to be uneasy, worrying, etc. It's only making you want to vomit.3. Plot. It's basically non existent. Only thenfog, and the sense of entrapment is like taken from UBIK by P. K. Dick, but that is all. Rest is like a scrapbook made by a person with too much glue to sniff, trying to tell to many stories at once, hiping that together they make sense.4. Clichés. Yes, you can find here few references to well known SF movies, but that scraps cannot make this a good movie.5. No hope. Not in the story though. From the first few minutes you know that you are wasting your time, and if you stick thru the movie to watch, you will understand how right you was.One good thing - warp sequence is simply nice to look at."
tt2251275,"I saw this movie at the Sci-Fi London festival. I went with a friend and we had no idea about what we're going to see. We went to see a Hungarian 'arthouse' sci-fi but ended up seeing the most strange and unlikely movie we've ever been to. It was advertised as a computer generated movie but for a couple minutes I thought the shots were actually live action. The hand-held camera simulation certainly adds to the illusion. There are of course a couple of shots where that illusion of reality disappears but for about half an hour you really have to wonder if the movie is ""real"" or computer generated. It certainly adds to the theme which develops around the concept of a multi-level or multi-verse virtual reality. It is not like like 'Matrix' however. The story revolves around an astronaut trying to find his way out of a messy virtual reality game but there is no way I can describe the story properly because the structure of the storytelling is truly weird. I can only compare it to films like 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Primer' but I can also tell you that it's a lot more complicated than anything that comes to my mind. For me was really hard puzzle to solve. And it is not just a puzzle where you can put the parts together and come up with the one and only solution because the movie has an open ending. This I think makes it only suitable for those who can live without a big moment or a final resolution. But if you're really into finding solutions for nearly unsolvable problems then this movie is for you. I guess knowing a bit about the Church-Turing thesis also helps understanding what's going on. I liked the zen-like soundscapes and the Commodore 64 generated music which reminded me of the '80s. The movie also also operates with references to a number of famous science fiction movies so if you're a film fan I'm sure you'll like this one."
tt2251275,"I can't help but wonder about the dark, political references the director might be making to the situation in his homeland in this disturbing tale, which is a cross between Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece and the epic doom and gloom of Hungarian director Bela Tarr. Although the effects aren't as high tech as other high budget sci-fi flicks, they are definitely visually rich, surreal at times, and very effective in telling the story. The only question is what is the real story? The film's title clearly alludes to the seemingly endless circular narrative that offers no escape for the protagonist Jack, as a dark 'fog' – a metaphor for all those uncontrollable forces in our lives – comes creeping closer and closer by the minute. Thankfully, Jack has the courage to venture off the beaten path into some potentially dangerous territory (beautiful and bizarre computer generated spaces) rather than give in, in hopes that he might be able to break the cycle. Despite the somewhat unconventional narrative structure, which actually helps move the story along, Cycle is mesmerising both visually and aurally and has enough stamina to draw you into Jack's world as he tries desperately to escape his nightmarish situation with very little help from the base station or those strange masked men who keep on popping up throughout the course of the film. Suitable for those who like their sci-fi dark and gritty."
tt2251275,"I cannot claim to have understood the story, but for me the graphics made it all worthwhile. A somewhat disorientating experience, but not in a bad way."
tt2251275,"Overall this is 4.3, strange when there are only 3 other reviews giving it a 10.A strange mind bending homage to so many films and games, the multiverse version to Primer's time travel. Also seems a bit Lovecraftian.Totally bonkers and I quite liked it. The CGI wasn't as convincing for me, looked like like a generic decade old sci if video game."
tt5691024,"Well, not sure what to say,loved all the different breeds of dogs,I am not a movie critic,and this movie is real hard to watch.
My mother always said if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all"
tt5691024,"I like Will Arnett, he can be good in both animated and live action movies but he wasn't that good in this with this stupid script for the actors to read.At least the dogs are real dogs and not CGI, except when they are jumping around doing stunts then the dogs are CGi and talented actors voicing them have bad lines to read.It has bad jokes, dumb references to other movies and annoying characters.The bloopers in the credits were funnier than the movie, but the reason it's not rated lower is because little kids can enjoy this and can ignore the problems."
tt5691024,"NYPD dog Max (Ludacris) is involved in a customs investigation which gets crossed with FBI agent Frank (Will Arnett)'s investigation into a stolen panda. A lead sends the duo to join a dog show in Las Vegas. They befriend dog trainer Mattie (Natasha Lyonne) and the various dogs in the show.This has a few lazy reference, one of which is Turner and Hooch. I'm not a fan of that movie and this is somehow worst. Will Arnett must know that he's in a dog movie. He certainly seems like it. He's not having any fun and neither is the audience. This is a kid's movie without the fun or the joy. The talking animals aren't fun. The buddy cop duo isn't fun. The investigation isn't fun. None of it is fun."
tt5691024,Reading the critics' reviews we weren't sure what to expect but we all laughed a lot and had a great time. Kids loved it and were quoting it all the way home. I highly recommend this old fashioned fun kids flick. You won't be disappointed!
tt5691024,"This movie is only slightly entertaining, parents should know, when the dog's genitals are groped by the show organizers, he doesn't' like it, and is told he needs to just deal with it and not complain to anyone (when he is being ""checked out"")....he is told to find his happy place and just bear it, that it will be over soon. Terrible message for kids in my opinion. Wonder what pedophile will use this as an example the next time they are grooming their victims. I'm all for artistic freedom, but this is a really creepy message. It's a message like so many women have been victim of in Hollywood....you want to get in the show, you better let me do what I want. But it's even worse that it is geared toward children. They ""humanize"" these animals so kids can relate to them....and then send this creepy, not so subliminal message."
tt5691024,I saw a free advanced screening of this movie and my god. Terrible literally doesn't even begin to describe this utter garbage. If you want to watch an actual good dog show comedy watch BEST IN SHOW by Christopher Guest. That's a genius film. If you think Scooby Doo is funny then you'll probably like this but if you are into actual comedies then skip this atrocity and watch Best in Show.
tt5691024,"I can't believe I have to write this, but parents need to be warned that there are actual child grooming messages in this movie. The entire success of the main dog's mission rests on him overcoming his trauma about having his genitals inspected, and acquiescence to being interfered with by an authority figure. I kid you not. There are several questionable scenes encouraging him to disassociate while being traumatised 'down there', and then when he eventually submits the trauma is painted as wonderful. I cannot believe this movie was allowed to be made let alone released and marketed to children. I am surprised there isn't more of an uproar about it.The rest of the movie is also unfunny and boring. So it's not for adults either."
tt5691024,"A lot to say, not much time.I just wanted to clarify that this is, indeed, a kids movie, but it is in no way a suitable movie for both kids and people with brains.A dog dabs.I rest my case."
tt5691024,"If you want a good movie about dogs, don't watch this. Instead, watch ""Isle of Dogs"". This is legit the worst movie I've seen so far this year and I sat through all of Truth or Dare."
tt5691024,"If you want a deep thought provoking movie...this ain't it.
If you want side-splitting, laugh-a-minute comedy... this ain't it.
If you want a cute light-hearted movie to spend an hour and a half on and leave the theater feeling a little better than you went in...go for it.Think ""Miss Congeniality"" meets ""Homeward Bound"" and you won't be disappointed."
tt5691024,"I usually hate kid movies. Almost all of them, especially animated ones. I didn't have any expectations going into this, but the jokes were actually pretty funny and it was a cute storyline. People are always going to hate on movies like this but it's not made for adults. It's a kids movie, and a pretty good one at that. If you're looking for a cute funny movie with really adorable animals, go see it! You might be surprised."
tt5691024,"I did not realize that Ludacris was so hard up on money,but apparently like Tyrese Gibson barking on Youtube about being broke, The Fast and Furious Franchise aint paying the brothers enough money so apparently he does need to do this alternative.Luda plays Max, a tough as nails NYPD dog who teams up with Will Arnett, whose obviously trying to not make Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows his worse movie (He failed cause this movie out shines Turtles 2 100 percent). 
Together in a not so uncanny buddy cop movie (cause they did do it in Turner and Hooch) they go under cover as dog show contestants to find an animal smuggler. Realistic, this movie is stupid, that's a given, but what it has going for it is that it knows how stupid it is, and with that knowledge you can't help but to laugh at the dumbness going on. There are so many points in the movie that are just so foolish, but you can't help but to smirk. It's like Ludacris is taking the role so seriously that the whole thing is...Ludacris (he does the same pun in the film), and I can't help myself. So yeah, Show Dogs is bad, but it's definitely worth seeing. It will make you laugh!"
tt5691024,Omg this movie sucks sooooo bad! Why does everyone love it so much?? Every scene was just pure cringe with irrelevant jokes! I would rather watch the emoji movie than this!! 0/10
tt5691024,"This movie was really good, it lived up to the hype. Will Arnett's best role since G-Force. I'd give it a 7.9/10 but a 10 on IMDb because this film is being unnecessarily hated on. Go see it."
tt5691024,"Just like the other animated movies, awful and continuously boring, want to watch a good animated film? check out films like shrek."
tt5691024,No!Skip this please.I lack words to write about this - this - this - ?
tt5691024,"Will Arnett is a well respected actor with many credits to his name. In addition to TV shows such as ""30 Rock"", he's done some terrific voice acting for many films such as ""BoJack Horseman"" and ""The Lego Movie""/""Lego Batman"". So I can't help but wonder if someone was angry at him or perhaps his agent was a pussycat...otherwise I have no idea WHY he'd agree to star in this film. It's truly terrible and a movie that only small children could stomach. As for adults, if they watch this one there's a strong likelihood they'll throw something at the TV instead of finishing it! Yes....it's THAT bad.I should have known the movie was crap when the DVD jacket from Netflix began with 'From the director of Beverly Hills Chihuahua...."". That pretty much says it all....as that film was about as enjoyable as a root canal....without anesthesia!! And here they are again with a film about talking dogs!!! Uggh!!!The story is about a police dog who investigates and solves crimes all on his own. Naturally, he and all the other animals in the picture can talk....and once again it's pretty much like ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" because of this. This is NOT a good thing by the way....talking animals wears thin very quickly. Many of you have seen either this or films like ""Dogs and Cats"" (which is marginaly better)....but who wants to see this sort of thing more than once? In other words, you've seen one, you've seen them all.The bottom line is that this is a very bad film--mostly because adults and older kids would rather eat their leg than see something like this. For small children, it's okay entertainment....just make sure you do NOT stay in the room and watch with them....your brain will thank you for this.Overall, bad writing, creepy CGI and a nonsensical script make this film about animal smuggling one you really want to avoid. I only give this one a 2 becacuse small kids might enjoy it....MIGHT."
tt5691024,"Show Dogs is a movie from the ""lauded"" director of the Scooby-Doo and The Smurfs 1 and 2. This movie tells of a police dog named Max and his human partner Frank, played by Will Arnett who attend a dog show in Vegas in order to go undercover to rescue a baby panda. Along the way, Frank tries to keep Max in the dog show with the help of Mattie played by Natasha Lyonne.I went to this movie expecting it to be another bad family film with loud, obnoxious characters, ""cool and hip"" humor and a by the numbers plot. However, I went in with the slightest bit of optimism that it'd not be something like that. As soon as it begun though, I realized that this was exactly what I was picturing in my head.When the movie opens with the dog staking out the crime, I knew what I was in for. The dialogue for this movie is nonstop. It's snappy, fast paced, is just annoying and hardly ever stops. There were some moments near the end that were fairly quiet and calm. Most of the movie, however consisted of rambling, nonstop dialogue, which is a problem indicating that the characters in this movie will not shut up. That's my biggest complaint with the film, plain and simple.It's a highly unfunny movie generally speaking. Most of the jokes revolve around pop culture humor, gas humor, screaming and many other things you would find annoying. As a matter of fact, since there were only 2 other people in the theater, whenever a ridiculously bad joke was made, I laughed hysterically while frowning. This occurred notably when there was a pop culture gag like when one of the dogs dabbed, in a 2018 movie. The humor is just lowbrow and annoying.The plot is, like I said, a by the numbers kids movie plot. It's a detective plot, you know how it will end, there's really nothing else to talk about.The only decent aspect of the movie is that the human actors put in effort into their roles. Arnett and Lyonne put on good enough performances to make this atrocity of a movie slightly redeemable. Although I'm not sure why they hired celebrities for characters that would appear fora couple minutes like with RuPaul.Overall, this movie is nothing. There's no reason for this to exist; we've seen plenty of kids movies with pandering humor, predictable stories and plain annoyance. It's also pretty laughable how it's out during a time when we have big releases in theaters like Infinity War, Deadpool and soon to be Solo: A Star Wars Story. Skip this movie.2/10"
tt5691024,"I went to see this movie with my 7 and 9 year old cousins and they absolutely loved it! For a kids movie it was actually pretty decent. The movie is very lighthearted and cute, which was all we were looking for. The sexual stuff was obviously meant to be humorous and I don't think the little kids seeing this movie are going to look so deeply into it so everyone can chill lol."
tt5691024,"So as my headline says this movie is for kids, did the clueless low raters think they were watching Schindlers list when they saw this? Or most likely the vast majority of them havent seen it and are just giving it a low rating anyway.Look this isnt going to be the best movie you will ever see but it is fun. Even as a 36 year old male I got a laugh from it. I saw this movie as part of a charity screening and I had alot of fun watching it.
And to all those that are giving this a low rating because this childs movie does not live up to their supposed intellectual prowess..... You people really are to be pitied."
tt5691024,"Back in 2002, I watched Raja Gosnell's film, ""Scooby-Doo"".... and I just loved it! At this point, I've seen all the movies he's directed. I like family films, especially ones with dogs. Generally, the consensus about his movies hasn't been very favorable. I have nothing to complain about, though. I knew what I was getting into when I bought the ticket for this movie. I knew it wouldn't be the funniest movie I'd see this year. I knew there'd be talking dogs, and fart jokes, and kiddie humor. But you know what? I enjoy these kind of movies. Nobody assumes they'll be award winning, or something to make you think. Sometimes you just want to watch something funny, and for me, this did the trick. I liked it for what it was. (It also helps that I love dogs, and I'm sure Mr. Gosnell does, too!) Will Arnett does his usual schtick, Stanley Tucci is hilarious, and I was surprised to see Natasha Lyonne (I haven't seen her on the big screen in years)! I enjoyed this movie, and I think other people (especially dog lovers) would, too."
tt5691024,"Talking dogs, talking babies, talking cars. There usually only one good movie ever made but they continue to try. Thankfully, this will forever make it harder to finance a talking dog movie. Don't get me wrong, Ludacris was funny as Max, the streetwise canine cop. Casting did their job as many voices were spot on but with no script, direction and inferior production values, they had no chance. The CGI was mildly inventive but the rest was awful."
tt7949046,"The 5 stars are for the opportunity to see and hear Neil Young and his band, Willie Nelson and two of his boys, Lukas and Micah. Lukas does an amazing version of his father's song, Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground, which I thought at first was Willie. Beautiful voice, and so like his old man. What a gift!I liked the music, and seeing these people I was happy to see in a film (always great to see Willie, even if only briefly). Liked the ranch/old west location, the costumes, the wildlife and nature, the focus on sharing seeds and growing food, the lack of violence, some of the dialogue (there wasn't much).This is like an overlong, surreal, poorly shot/directed/edited music video. If you are looking for a coherent story with a beginning, middle and end, this isn't it. If you like the people involved and their music and have nothing much to do, you could have this on and enjoy its special moments."
tt7949046,"Self described ""auteur"" Darryl Hannah stumbles around some mighty pretty territory while her cinematographer Adam Vollick fumbles to get acquainted and haphazardly experiment with his camera in this disjointed slacked jawed oater that features legendary rocker Neil Young and his band playing cowboys. With only snippets of jarring visual interest and the ambiguity of the early moments dissolving into heavy handed pretense it takes a full half hour for Paradox to pull out of its scattered torpor as Neil and the boys come to the rescue with a stirring rendition of his Peace Trail. The respite remains brief however as Young takes one of his most beautiful acoustical works Pocohantes and turns it into a dirge with a portable pipe organ. The rest of his score simply provides intrusive bombast to enigmatic skies, glorious aspens and grazing animals (deservedly noted in the credits since they give the best performances) while cowgirl in the sand Hannah incoherently presents her surreal vision with an 8 1/2 version of two cowpokes tethered to the ground flying kite like above the tent where Neil and the boys perform. Paradox is similar in many ways to Young's wandering Journey Through the Past made in the 1970s. After the massive success of the documentary Woodstock Hollywood was eager to tap into the hippie phenomena and sought out Young who enlisted fellow pop troubadours that he would use and lose according to his needs over the years Crosby, Stills and Nash to make the same rambling self satisfied stream of conscious mess that Paradox is. This time around he's footing the bill and got a new band but the thrust remains the same, his presentation the nostalgic turn today that Lawrence Welk was offering his graying audience back in the 70s. Only the uniforms have been changed to protect the cool."
tt7949046,"3/26/18. Not for everybody. I like Neil Young, so the music part was great, not so much the disparity between the music and the background scenery (that had very little to do with the music). Watch this (or, maybe just listen to it) for Neil Young."
tt7949046,Ten minutes in and so far HUGELY disappointed. Awful directing and cinematography awful acting (apparently they're Young's band so they're not actors) the soundtrack from Young sounds great but I think maybe it could have just been an album and we could have imagined the movie ourselves.It doesn't improve. Feed like a student film... and not a great one.
tt7949046,"I kept waiting for some plot in this thing and there is none. The only thing it has is amateurish camera work trying to look artistic such as faded camera and other techniques that just don't work in the movie. The acting is amateurish. I didn't even like the guitar music. The camera was shaky and blurry at times and really more aimed at catching scenery that would be a more appropriate for National Geographic. An absolute snoozer unless you like the music and for action you have a guy peeing on a rock or two guys sitting in an outhouse talking to each other. Even the beginning fails by using dialogue between two of them to explain each of the characters. I found myself fast-forwarding to try and find something other than scenery or bad guitar music and I failed. If they wanted to make a bad music video, they may have succeeded. Don't waste your time."
tt7949046,"I so wanted to love this. Willy Nelson.
Neil Young? How could it not be fabulous.The intro is more interesting than the actual story. Even if it were just an album. You would have to edit out the annoying screeches. Great idea but...as always it's in the details."
tt7949046,"Sorry folks, but just a pathetic piece of nothing, with a nothing plot, nothing actors, nothing cinematography.Not even Willie Nelson or Neil Young could save it.Not even the writer made a dent in the idiocracy of this film.Nothing Nothing Nothing.Where in the heck did all these 9 & 10 scores come from?Sad.Pathetic.And hopefully Daryl Hannah will go back to what she does best - breaking up people's marriages. Sans Neil."
tt7949046,"With some of the gorgeous, but badly shot, Colorado mountains and wildlife. The band's live performances are pretty good but too, too much amateur film around it. The non-band soundtrack, which is mostly Young and his electric guitar, pales next to his classic guitar soundtracks, like the Malick film, Dead Man. Plus a bunch of nothing blues licks/songs. FYI, Willie is only in this for 5sec.This throwback film makes me feel old as I am. I guess Young and Hannah still cling to the circa 1970 fad of being in a ""cool"" cowboy film with pop music, ala Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Kids will think they are watching an old folks film.If you have a message to get across, please don't make it ""only for insiders"" and those who ""understand"" Young's films. That's stupid. If you want to make an environmental statement that's effective, then do it right. Ditto mountain music video or live concert.Pretty good jam in the middle, based on Cowgirl in the Sand. But left me wishing the actual song was in there somewhere. Nice version of Pocahontas, but underwhelming Peace Trail. Interesting version of Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground, by Willie's imitative son, Lukas, except it sounds too studio, but the players are often in the campfire's smoke lol. Hats off to them for sticking it out.I figure the best thing is to mark the performance spots and ignore the rest, but why? Just go to YT and see all you want without bad acting, bad cinematography, bad direction, and all the cluelessness you don't want."
tt7949046,Alejandro jodorowsky's movie.she could be good actress but from a and z bad production.
tt7949046,Really enjoyed this movie I'd like to see more! Only wish Neil would invite me to tag along and play a few tunes. If you take it for what it is you'll love it. Very laid back and good!
tt7949046,"It was slow getting started ... if it ever did ... and the story (if there was one) made no sense to me. I liked some of the songs, I liked Willie Nelson and his sons. Neil ... well, it was an ego-trip, wasn't it? But we did watch the whole movie and when it was done, I asked my son, what was that about? He said you'd have to be stoned to find out, I guess. Rock on, Neil."
tt7949046,"Bizarre. Barely a movie.Nothing much to say about 'Paradox', the above says enough. I will note that the music and, particularly, the visuals are actually quite good, the latter is basically what kept me watching - along with the 73 minute run time, which admittedly doesn't drag as much as it ought to. The plot is extremely thin and the acting isn't the best. One to avoid.///
the cast includes Neil Young Lukas Nelson Micah Nelson Corey McCormick Anthony LoGerfo Tato Melgar Willie Nelson Dave Snowbear Toms Charris Ford Robert Schmoo Schmid Tim Gooch Lougee Dulcie Clarkson Ford Alexandra Dascala."
tt7949046,"Well this is not an unmissable movie by any standard, but as everyone knows, who has been to a Neil Young gig, you cannot help falling in love with, in awe of, the artist. So you get seduced by the simplicity and truth of this movie as you would in a Neil Young concert.This is a movie shot over a few days, so it should be rated as you would an end of cursus student effort, and in that case it is, to play with words, ""the great silence"" of student movies. The plot is inexistent but the images are great, and the music is outstanding.Just go and roll with it if you feel like it. Stay clear if you only listen to bland pop supermarket sugar."
tt7949046,"This is the way films should be made more often. Not all of them but a good many.This isn't Hollywood so if you are expecting a three act, plot driven pile of industry crap it's not that, and it's not meant to be that either. And you will miss the point if you do.It is however a piece of brilliance and more of a visual poetic documentation of a way of life. Anyone who says different is lacking in intelligence. You have to nail yourself to the seat and watch it from beginning to end and slap yourself across the face several times as you watch it to stop looking for structure. Its flaws are what makes it a great film.Stick with it and have an open mind and it will sink in.10/10 from me if there was an eleven I'd give it that. Mark my words it will be a cult film one day👍"
tt7949046,"Cinematography and directing were awesome. Music was great. Acting ranged from amateur-hour to not bad. As a musician and film fan, I enjoyed it most after the 23 minute mark."
tt7949046,"This is a really fun movie that delights so many of the senses, especially sight and sound. The filming is gorgeous and the music is as good as it gets. Weave both together with a cast that doesn't take themselves too seriously and you have one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in a long time. Ignore the stuffy reviewers that miss the entire point of this delightful movie. The time went by quickly and I only wish there was more. There was some symbolism with regard to the teepees, seeds, and farming that anyone that follows Neil and his recordings would understand. If you like Neil and support many of the causes he is so passionate about, you'll really enjoy this."
tt7949046,"If you're looking for standard movies, big budgets etc.: go elsewhere! This film is not for you.
If you can suspend standard expectations, you might enjoy this film. You'd have to know Neil's other films to see this and enjoy it.
It's humorous and insightful (love is like a fart...)
The filmstock is excellent, as is the cinematography.
Viewers that expect standard formulas in films should stick to Hollywood-produced efforts. Do not go out beyond your comfort level!
Reviewers that apply standard formulas to Neil's movies will just scratch their heads and wonder."
tt7949046,Neil Young only for fans and nerds. Great live performance!
tt7949046,"Watched this on a wim, with no idea what to expect. First 15 minutes, I had no idea what was going on, but as it progressed it was oddly satisfying and enjoyable, music throughout was great. Shot beautifully, definitely a film to watch more than once!"
tt7949046,"Land level cowboy space travel at its best.The brilliance of many brilliant artists are brilliantly patched together in a dusty dream. There is no way to properly describe Paradox to anyone. Either you will love it and be part of it or you just won't get it at all.If you are too trapped in lifelock at the moment then maybe,just maybe this film will nudge you to the side just enough to break free to make time for yourself to do something you love. If you are already freely traveling,this film will send a starlit night breeze to lift you a little more. Great job Daryl! And the rest of you hooligan outlaws,I'm quite sure you gave Ms Hannah exactly what she was hoping to tap into."
tt7949046,"Neal Young plays the guitar like he was born with it.
Willie Nelson has his own brand of cannabis.
Farm Out - Keep On Trucking!!
Happy Trails"
tt7949046,"Think of this as a creative and offbeat film, rather than a traditional movie with a ""normal"" plot. If you can do this, you'll find Paradox is an entertaining blend of great music, humor, and a passion for the environment. (Daryl Hannah, Neil Young and Willie Nelson are all strong environmentalists.) The scenery and the cinematography are beautiful, the cast and band look like they had a good time making the film, and the music is, of course, excellent. When I was scanning for something to watch, I wasn't sure about this, but I'm glad I gave it a try. It was great."
tt7949046,Daryl Hanna is an incredible film maker and director. Neil Young is so cool. I dropped and watched this.
tt10230426,"As bollywood was not enough for them, now they are screwing up Netflix India as well. Requesting farah khan and her husband to stop making movies, please. As far as the movie is concerned, a failed attempt at creating a dark thriller.
Watch something else but this."
tt10230426,Not very good in thriller but it's below than average. Worst acting by Jacqueline... but manoj Bajpai acting is really awesome.
tt10230426,Dear NetflixPlease work on content not on stars ... back to back disaster Netflix india ....
tt10230426,"Overacting, we used see such brilliant movies like Andhadhun but this looks too weak"
tt10230426,Jacqueline's overacting is the worst.Bad direction the audience is shocked because of poor start of the movie.Its a waste of time
tt10230426,There was a scene where police entered her home for investigation and her hindi accent was so annoying.. what was she doing in India for so long when she can't even speak Hindi properly.. there is nothing wrong in speaking wrong Hindi but she is acting in Hindi movies so it should be natural.. guys someone plz sponsore her acting class she is damn annoying
tt10230426,"Save yourself some time and do not watch this no matter what. I created an account just to rate and review this movie.
Worst direction, worst dialogues, worst cinematography and absolutely poor and overacting (with Manoj Bajpayee being an exception)
And they even have the audacity to end movie with a hint that there will be second part. You got to be indeed smoking some real cheap stuff if you think anybody will ever watch second part when finishing first part itself was a daunting task.
May god have mercy on all of us and save us from Shirish Kunder and his movies. Amen!!"
tt10230426,"So so so Irritating content.. Over acting, no story, low budget, sasti radhika apte who is sister of freakin spiderman... What the stupidity have i watched seriously.. Jacky plz stay away from netflix.. Nd even manoj Overacated.. It ws very very waste.. Trust me don't even think of watching this.. Please"
tt10230426,Avoid on all cost. There is nothing watch-worthy in this.It's a injustice to Netflix-India.Netflix India need to screen and accept series.
tt10230426,"It would have been better if it was Mr Serial Killer, Jacqueline is not a good actress. Movie would have been better if Jacqueline was replaced by Vidya Balan."
tt10230426,"Manoj Bajpai was the only good thing in this movie. Idiot director didn't give him enough screen time 😡. I don't understand why people still take Jacqueline Fernandez as actress. Send her back to srilanka. I know language is not a barrier for acting , but in her case it is. She don't know 'A' of acting. Time waste movie."
tt10230426,"Guys go and watch this movie as soon as possible, it's a movie worth to watch !! It's a great movie with a combination of thrill and intensity. Manoj Bajpayee has done his job so good."
tt10230426,"Mrs Serial Killer Review.
Intense, Thrilling
.
Jacqueline tried something different(Psycho) this time and it's good too. As i always say i don't spoil the story by telling anything related to the content. So, 1 hr 46 minutes runtime is enough and delivers good fun.
Mrs Serial Killer is Good a worth watch movie
we can say ride of thrill not that awesome but good. I like it just because of Manoj Sir and Jacqueline. Manoj sir don't have much screen time but he gave his best, for some people He is only reason, for me too but after watching it i must say Jacqueline nicely done it.
Nicely written and executed but some scenes like you get the chance when you want it to. Wow. It's not digestible.
With new kind of Storyline it has the flavour to make audience engage and Sometimes
it looses too. it'll surely make you bore some scenes. one time watch and depends, Blink.
I liked it just because of new storyline.
Thank you
Enjoy your lockdown.

tt10230426,"I know it's quarantine period. Still i would ask everyone not to waste your 2 hrs on, started it for Manoj Vajpai but had to shut it becoz of Jaqualine's acting and accent. Shirish kunder take out sometime and get lost...what were u trying to do. Mohit raina got wasted"
tt10230426,"Started watching this movie today ,could not bear it for even 10 minutes because of Jacqueline overacting , worst I have seen. Even if the story is good ,one cannot bear the actress , nonsensical acting."
tt10230426,"How deceiving promos can be. Was excited after the trailer but my god what pathetic story line, even worse acting."
tt10230426,"Manoj Bajpeyi - why .. why .. why u did the role ..
how worst a movie and acting can be its a prime example.. worst that Salman Khan movies.."
tt10230426,"I mean seriously he should not direct any movies ever. One time will come when you will feel like killing yourself that why did you even plan to watch this movie. Please don't waste your 2 hours, rather you could even thank yourself if you were blacked out for 2 hours."
tt10230426,Jaqueline is worst in it. even i've seen few performances of jaqueline and i've always been disappointed by her but in this movie i just couldn't bear her for even 4 minutes..a total turn off now i am gonna totally cut down on her movies/webseries
tt10230426,"I personally like jaqu maam .. Mrs. Killer is quite good ... just bcz of my fav. ..
i hope tis could be better..The actors were good but the audience may be expecting more and good from the movies.."
tt10230426,"The story is worth calling a thriller which has enough scenes to keep you hooked to the screen but it has been ruined by the performance of Jacqueline Fernandez. Manoj Bajpayee steals the show towards the end and saves the film from calling a dull one. Overall, a descent one for thriller movie lovers which is worth the time"
tt10230426,I don't care what the story is the main actor doesn't know 1 rupee acting
tt6021260,"It's okay at best. I was drawn to the show by nostalgia for the days of watching Bill explain things as a kid. I am not sure what I expected, but I expected something a little more scientific and less political, I agree with Bill on most things so that's not really a complaint. But outside of his political commentary the show really doesn't have much to stand on outside of nostalgia. It's tacky, odd, and goofy. A personality that works for a children's program explaining things, not so much for a political satire interspersed with basic science. I feel like I could watch the old episodes of Bill Nye, the ones geared directly to children and glean the same amount of ""Scientific"" knowledge from it. I think Bill is a stand up guy, and a great debater and a voice more people should be willing to hear. But he should leave the political commentary to John Oliver, Sam Bee, Trever Noah....etc"
tt6021260,"There is little to no science in this show. It's almost entirely propaganda. If you enjoyed Bill Nye The Science Guy stay away from this show. If you are expecting science there is none to find here, just humorless comedy and painfully obvious propaganda. They push political and social issues and try to put a scientific spin on them. There is no substantial educational benefit from this show. They are simply trying to sway political and social views."
tt6021260,"I use to love Bill Nye as a child, he made science fun and worth learning. But this new show is terrible. Its promoting all sorts of non-science as science and is highly politicized and polarizing. A show about science should be about, well it should be about science. This show does not do that, this show is one part politics and one part failed musical."
tt6021260,"First off, I have created an account just to be able to leave a review as I was astounded to see so many 1 star reviews! What's up with you all? 
It's SO funny and informative. It's not pretending to be a serious boring documentary or lecture!
I thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope Netflix do more series."
tt6021260,"I am so very disappointed with this sad excuse of a television program. Bill Nye was one of my idols growing up, and I remember watching ""The Science Guy"" every day I would come home from school. Fascinated by the way Bill used to captivate the minds of myself and my friends/classmates, I knew, without a doubt, ""Saves the world"" would be a genius new installment. I was horribly wrong. There is absolutely no science or even reason behind any of the discussions in the show. Bill Nye is dead to me, and I feel we've lost a true pioneer in the field of science."
tt6021260,"Warning! Recently there have been hundreds of fake and detrimental reviews of this show, you can check for yourself and see that most of the people leaving these reviews have only posted this one 1* review, and no other reviews at all. There was a twitter campaign to slate this show after it spoke out against the current US Presidential view that Global Warming was all just a lie, and not actually a real thing.So I'd say watch it for yourselves and form your own opinions, also to all of you people who have rated this 1* you are not actually supporting IMDB or the community here by doing this, and you are no better than bullies or other Internet trolls. Grow up."
tt6021260,"This show is getting bad ratings for the WRONG reasons, generally. It's a show about FACT versus FICTION. Does A cause B? Let's see. You want to know why this show is necessary? Because people are too uninformed. They are either gullible, or stubborn, or think they know more than (insert name). Maybe they don't ""trust"" science. Maybe that's because they don't ""understand"" science. This show attempts to fix that problem... and hence... save the world. Look at Polio... do you really want that to spread because you were too lazy/ignorant/stubborn/suspicious, to get a vaccine??You don't have to believe in vaccines... doesn't change the FACT that they work... and the FACT that they don't cause autism. If you fail to vaccinate, you put everyone else at risk.You can believe in ""sound therapy"", but that does NOT mean that some imbecile screaming at your belly is going to offer any kind of medical benefit.You can believe in ""alternative medicine"", but that does NOT mean it works! None of it does. That's why it's called alternative. It's hocus pocus dreamland foolishness and nothing more than a way for people to profit off of people who are too uninformed to know they're being ripped off.This show explains things to adults like they're children. That's a valid criticism. I cringe a lot watching it, but I'm rating it an 8/10 because it does a good job demonstrating FACT versus FICTION. The humor is dreadful (sorry Bill), but the information is incredibly valuable. Wanting to convey THE TRUTH, doesn't make this ""political"", or ""propaganda"". Okay, so he only has a degree in Mechanical Engineering, so he's not worthy of being a scientist, right? WRONG. Want a definition of what that is?""Mechanical engineering is the discipline that applies engineering, physics, and materials science principles to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems. It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering disciplines."" - Wikipedia.With that in mind, I hear people complain that he isn't a scientist, so what right does he have to tell us anything... this coming from people who often have no post secondary education, and whose education often times is, with all due respect, limited to flipping burgers and pouring coffee (I've been one of those people too, in years past). And for those who do have a degree, say in English (like myself), or Political Science, or History, or any number of others... what makes YOU more qualified to judge HIM?The show is over the top ridiculous. I cringe regularly. BUT, I enjoy the information it provides. At least he is TRYING to make the world a better place, by spreading truth. What are you doing with your life, reader? What are YOU contributing to bettering the world? Before you judge, please think more critically before making such harsh accusations and assumptions."
tt6021260,"I thought this was supposed to be Bill Nye for adults. He brings in some serious experts to discuss the subjects of the shows, then gives the experts maybe 5 or 6 minutes. I understand his opening explanations of what he is trying to convey, but the silly skits belittle the legitimacy of the message. If he really wants to appeal to adults, he needs to tone down the silliness. Otherwise, he needs to market this series as a program for children, with a caution as to subject matter. Please, Bill, give more time to the panel of experts and less time to the dancing eggplant."
tt6021260,"No i DON'T think this show is a ten. I rated it ten because I don't understand all the 1's. Sure the show isn't going full Marie Currie on the science aspect, but it is entertaining. As far as the whole political agenda goes, I don't think these people watched more than one episode. I don't understand how global warming became a political issue ANYWAYS! Thanks Donald. Global warming is a REAL issue and it deserves to be addressed. It's more of a worldwide social issue. That said I'd REALLY give the show a 6. It's OK."
tt6021260,"It was 4am, I was in tremendous amounts of pain due to nerve damage in my back and neck thanks to a car crash, with no one online to speak to moan about my life I came off YouTube with the last video I watched about Bill Nye and this show and I started looking at Netflix sizing up the episode list.
The show isn't as bad as some of the 'American reviews' made it out to be, sure there is some political propaganda, but if you class this as false or incoherent information, I'm sorry bud, you're a conspiracy theorist, climate change is real and there are more than two genders in circumstances. My only qualm about this show was the inaccuracy that it presented in the movement of fist-bumps, it probably had around a 70% hit rate in terms of this. So if you're going to moan about this show, moan about it trying too hard with it's theme song, fist-bumps and creepy animations.If you're a flat Earther then this show isn't for you, try a show like Most Haunted UK."
tt6021260,I've come to believe that this is the worst production of anything that I have ever seen. Bill Nye has lost all his credibility with this attempt at wit. It's absolutely HORRIBLE. Unwatchable. He'd better start working on saving his reputation. The musical performances were equally as bad. It was tough to tell if they were trying to be humorous. They failed.
tt6021260,"What is going on with all these negative reviews?! I get people having differing opinions, but so many of the reviews seem to have been written by people who didn't even watch the show! If you enjoy learning science from a diverse and balanced group of guests and you genuinely care about our environment, planet and the human race, give this show an actual chance (as in WATCH it) and then give an actual review."
tt6021260,What better way to turn people away from the scientific method than to inject it with elite Hollywood propaganda. This show accomplishes the exact opposite of what it set out to do.I do wonder how much of a role Bill had in picking the topics and how he was able to discuss them. I hope for his sake he was strong-armed into the end result.
tt6021260,"I mean seriously? This is just garbage. I can't believe this got made. Bill Nye is literally a science denier. It's a travesty having him ""promote"" science. His ""alternative facts"" do more harm than good. And he's not even a scientist. He's a mechanical engineer who quit to become a stand-up."
tt6021260,"This update of Bill Nye is thoughtful and relevant to adults. My husband is a scientist and grew up watching Bill Nye's show, and can back up that he has seen & read work by some of the featured scientists. Despite what one of the previous ""non-science"" review, this show IS grounded in research and science. His panels are balanced with actual research scientists who present briefs of their work. Just because Bill may not share the same views as all his watchers, you will learn about topics of Sexuality, Medical Marijuana, Extinction, or Gaming. Not all of the bits are quite as entertaining or well written, but they do a very good job (sometimes they try hard to be funny and miss a bit)."
tt6021260,"About the actual show: The show is for adults, and it covers controversial themes. It can seem political at times, but only because we've decided (as a society) to politicize science. I'll admit that the show is a little clunky at times, but it is effective at summarizing the touchy science topics of our time. About the large amounts of 1 start reviews: Take a look at the user profiles for the other reviews, particularly all the 1-star reviews. They look like user accounts that were set up to write that single review or to trash any perceived left-leaning show. Whether written by bots or by people who really hate diversity, it's hard to say. Either way, give the show a chance and you may enjoy it."
tt6021260,"This show is giving value to right wingers and devaluing BILL NYE HIMSELF.I had respect for Bill before this but now it's all but gone.This is NOT science, this is not FACT. As far as I can tell the only true statements that are being stated are regarding global warming, and because this real science is seen with non-science it is devalued and more easily dismissed.Thanks for that Bill!"
tt6021260,"Wow, I can't believe how low people are willing to stoop to push their own ""political garbage."" The 1 star reviews on this show are so obviously just a political smear campaign. How many of them cite ""propaganda"", and blah, blah, blah as the basis of their review? Just read them for yourselves. Now for the (actual) review:Bill Nye is Back!!I remember the old Bill Nye: The Science Guy from when I was in elementary school, like 20 years ago. If I were in school today, I'd *love* to watch this! It's funny, engaging, educational, and scientific. If I were a kid in school I'd LOVE this as much as the original show! Bill talks about new topics like Artificial Intelligence, that didn't exist when the original show aired!Bill Nye grabs your attention! This isn't a boring college lecture of some guy standing in front of a whiteboard. (Trust me, I watch those too.) There are lab demonstrations, interesting topics, celebrity guests, jokes, and science! It's everything you could ever ask from a science show!I'm an almost 30 year old guy, who's intimately familiar with most these topics already. Even I was learning a lot of new information, and it was entertaining. He doesn't just tell you facts, he *shows you*!!It's also got Derek from Veritasium! I have been subscribed to his YouTube channels for years! I've been seriously considering going into ""edu-tainmant"" because of Bill Nye (The Science Guy), Derek (Veritasium), Destin (SmarterEveryDay), Michael (VSauce), everyone from Periodic Videos/Computerphile, and a lot of others I have't listed. (In fact, the (politically-motivated/B.S.) reviews just reassure me that we NEED educators now, more than ever!!)As far as improving the show goes: 1. There were a couple topics that were mentioned during the discussions that had piqued my interest, but I think were glanced over too quickly at the expert panel table. I understand this may have been intentional, to keep the discussion on-topic, but the ""tangents"" did pique my interest enough to look up on my own afterwards! 2. (This is where'd I'd put a second point if I had one.)If the producers/execs are reading this, please don't let the political B.S. hurt a good show! The show is perfect, as is!"
tt6021260,"I can not believe that this show is currently standing at a 3.6 star rating. That is the same rating as the movie ""The Room"", one of the worst films ever made. I've read some of the other reviews for this show and they all seem to fall into at least one of three categories: A) They did not realize this show was meant for a TV-14 audience B) They thought this show would be a modern rehashing of The Science Guy or C) They are conservatives who can't stand the idea of their personal beliefs being threatened by science. This show is much more a talk show than it is a purely educational program. In addition to science experiments, there are field correspondents, panel interviews, and comedy sketches. All with the goal of discussing what science has to say about topics relevant to us today. Ranging from climate change, to vaccines, to human sexuality, the show tackles its topics with a sense of humor and a viewpoint that scientific fact is not up for debate based on one's political or religious viewpoint. I will grant, this show is far from perfect. Some of the jokes fall flat and the panel discussions often feel awkward when Bill attempts to inject humor into serious discussions. And when a representative from Monsanto joins a panel to discuss GMOs, the organizations less than stellar history and business practices are all but glossed over completely. Still, this show in no way deserves the hate it has received. Maybe the 1 star reviewers need to be more like this show, and grow up."
tt6021260,"I do not often (have I ever?) written reviews for TV shows or movies. However, I thought this would be something to look forward to, addressing serious topics like global warming and science for the masses, right?There is a constant cheering and applauding for anything he says, it's really cringe worthy and I cannot for the love of something, understand what they are trying to accomplish here other than scare serious viewers away from such an important topic! I could barely make it through first episode, and I do not plan on watching any more than this. They are making science look bad, and a laughing stock on of the biggest problems humanity will face!"
tt8871764,I love reality tv but this show was boring but it finally gets a little better in episode 5. Finally some drama!!!!!!!!!!! These wealthy people are finally getting interesting......... but I would still love a spin off of this show from the house keepers point of view. I bet that would be super interesting because I am sure the staff hates thinks they suck too.
tt8871764,"This had so much potential but is so boring. Mexicans are fun and interesting with amazing personalities but these people on the show are lame and privileged. Where is the drama, the fun or anything of interest? I love reality TV but this show sucks. I bet this show would be more interesting if it focused on the staff at these rich peoples houses. I bet there lives are much more interesting than these boring rich people. (I did like the look at Mexico City tourist spots and the day of dead parade. Visiting Mexico City is on the bucket list.)"
tt8871764,This show is like the Mexican version of the Kardashian: a show about talentless rich people who live in a bubble far away from Mexico's reality and their world of luxury and elite social life in Mexico City. This is not representative of Mexico in any way or form.
tt8871764,"Pathetic and false view of allegedly ""Mexican elite"" Netflix couldn't get any lower with this trash!"
tt8871764,"Disclaimer: I'm Mexican and I only writing this in English for the sake of the review. 
Horrible, ridiculous, shallow and disgusting. I could not stand beyond the episode no. 4. Look, I don't have any trouble with Mexican rich people, and I don't have any trouble with american-gringos neither; what I have trouble is Mexican people been too obsessed with american culture to the point of acting and trying to behaving like one. This show is everything about Mexico isn't for: we are not that shallow, we are not that empty. But the most of all, WE DONT SPEAK ENGLISH IN MEXICO !!
Why all protagonist speak most of the time English ? ( or spanglish in this case ) ??? All right, there are a couple of girls that were born in the US and I thought ""ok... maybe all people are speaking English because these girls don't speak Spanish "" But later on the show I realized that they're half american and they're perfectly bilingual !!!
And to follow the insult to our county, they insist that ""we'are Mexicans"" What about the nonsense materialism ? And the classicism ? ( all blonds or cute people are the rich and the servants the brownies ) 
Then there is this Hanna girl who lives in a world on their own. ""We are so diverse "" Yes, we are diverse but not in the sense of countries like Canada or US, we are mostly brown skin and black hair because all the indigenous people and there is nothing wrong with that. But she is showing a Mexico like it we're mostly mixed with Asiatic, Arab, etc etc etc. Then there is one chapter where they were celebrating the ""Thanks giving"" ( another american-canadian tradition ) next to the Zocalo ... yea ... very very Mexican though. At the end, this is like another american TV show, including the casting. Is like the obsession some Americans traveling to another places around the world but expecting to have a nice environment that looks like their home in the US ( like how Cancun is right now ). 
These series is the most americanized series I ever seen and is not representative of Mexico, not even close. I feel myself very insulted and ashamed at the same time."
tt8871764,"Why did i watchec this crap? Answer just to fullfill my curiosity.
Veredict: This abomination is totally unwatchable. 
Snob entrepeneurs with horrible accents bragging. 
Thank God i was working in my computer and i didn't pay all the the attention. 
Netflix needs a PURGUE.
AVOD THIS ATTROCITY."
tt8871764,"A wonderful REALITY show which represents the .000000000001% of Mexicans!
Are you kidding yourselves NETFLIX?
-por favor, ¡no mamen!In order to understand SOME of the struggles that the other 99.00000001% of Mexicans endure constantly... watch NETFLIX' Chef's Table: season 5, episode 1."
tt8871764,"A lot of the reviewers seem to be under the impression that Netflix was going to show them something else. If you read the description of the show it very clearly states ""Get to know the opulent lifestyles and famous families of Mexico City's socialites and the expats vying for a spot in their exclusive social order."" This show isn't about everyday Mexicans and how they live their lives, this is a reality show about a few rich and famous individuals in Mexico and how they live their lives.If you're going into this show expecting a documentary about some of the struggles facing everyday Mexicans, you are in the wrong place. Would you watch the Bachelor to see how relationships are and work, or the Kardashians as a view of everyday Americans lives?The show is interesting and lively, and the people chosen to star in the show are each unique and fascinating in their own ways."
tt8871764,I'm Mexican and this is the most embarrassed I've being in my life of being one. We have so much to give (culturally speaking) and this is what Netflix decides to impulse? What a pitty.
tt8871764,"For some reason, most people writing reviews here think that this show is trying to be political or trying to represent Mexico. When in fact it's just a reality show that follows the lives and relationships of a small group of wealthy mexicans. It is in no way trying to take a stand on cultural, social or political matters."
tt8871764,"Having a hard time figuring out why people are putting more weight on Made in Mexico than other typical reality shows. As a reality show connoisseur I'll let you in on a secret, they're not supposed to be ""real"". I stumbled upon Made in Mexico bc most of the Real Housewives shows are on hiatus and I needed a fix. So even though I didn't feel like I could really relate given that the show was in Spanish, I got desperate so gave the first episode a shot and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it really want any different from any other bravo reality show - shallow and good looking people, unnecessary drama and surprisingly interesting insight into an aspect of Mexico City culture/society.It's not supposed to solve the world's problems and mend relations by the US and Mexico. It's really made for people like me who are addicted to inane reality shows. Also REALLY made me want to visit México City for the first time. Looking forward to 2nd season!P.s. is it just me or is Hanna the worst?"
tt8871764,"So many negative reviews on here! Can't help but point out that the show directly points out that its showing the 'elite' side of Mexico...the same side of US that so many reality shows are about (kardashians, any celebrity really, my sweet 16, real housewives, WAGS....etc.).....aka its not supposed to hit on the 'true' side of Mexico. Regardless....if you love drama and living vicariously through rich people, then you will enjoy this show. I found it refreshing since I've never really seen a show about a different country/culture's rich side. Go watch a Mexico documentary or Narcos if you feel upset you're not getting ""true Mexico"".......(again, that's explicitly not the intent of the show). Yes, they are whiter than you'd think, however if you know anything about Mexico you will know that there is a proven correlation between lightness of the skin & wealth/education level, get over it or go be a politician in mexico if that bothers you. I love the different story lines and felt attached to the cast!! would love for season 2. fans need to review!"
tt8871764,"I see what they were attempting to do. Supposedly, the idea is to show that ""not every Mexican is what Trump says about us"". However what they did was just as damaging. The creators for some odd reason felt that the best people to represent this was by choosing WOMEN that look white. I see no diversity in this cast. AND doubled down by actually inCluding an actual white girl. This wouldn't be so bad if the rest of the cast was ranging in looks. Anyway, I tried watching an episode so I could give a Chance...it was boring."
tt8871764,"It's not to be a hater towards the privileged people that are part of this show, but when you call a show Made in Mexico I would expect for the producers to show the traditional Mexican lifestyle. No it doesn't have to be about drugs and cartels but about how people actually live in Mexico, their foods, day to day lives etc. This show is only about the 1-2% of the high society. Big fail Netflixxxx !!!!"
tt8871764,"Made in Mexico is depicts a rare breed of people in Mexico. The rich. Not saying upper class, but truly .1% rich. The name of this out-of-reality show is a conflict, as this is not truly how people in Mexico live. The ""struggles"" of these individuals stem from their socioeconomic status, so people in the other side of the bubble CANNOT relate. It is dangerous to label a show ""Made in Mexico"" so broadly when the cast is not representative of the whole.If you do decide to watch this show (out of morbid curiosity) take it with a grain of salt. Know much of it is fiction and has made a lot of people in Mexico upset as Netflix LATAM, the cast (not so famous, by the way, couldn't recognize any of them) and the lack of self awareness surrounding the whole series."
tt8871764,This show made me cringe... Just terrible.................................................
tt8871764,"I get it is a reality show. But with that title I expected a more realistic life of the people of Mexico. Not these rich snobby people. Which one of them is from San Diego, CA. Really!! I watched 2 episodes out of courtesy. Will not be watching anymore. I have family that lives in Mexico D. F so I know not everyone lives the lavish lifestyle they are showing. Netflix so disappointed in you."
tt8871764,"Couldn't finish watching the first episode! That is not Mexico at all. Next time, get people that are actually proud of their country and traditions. All I see is wannabes speaking English..how sad."
tt8871764,I liked! I thought it very entertaining. I like to see how Mexico can be seen much more different then one thought. The architect that is shows is quite beautiful and the greenery was also lovely. The story lines are quite interesting. I thought some story lines were more interesting then other and I wish we could have seen more.
tt8871764,"This show would have been so, so, so much better with a more diverse cast. Diverse in appearance, background and intelligence. After a short while watching these individuals, it is obvious that they live in a bubble and are happy to make sure their blinders match their shoes. I was hoping for something more authentic and all I did was waste my time. If you are looking for predictable soap opera with rich brats who could pass for white and the only brown faces you see are in the kitchen, then by all means, have at it."
tt8871764,"Everyone complaining about the show is being ignorant. Yes, they are all rich, so what? The fact that they grew up in a privileged life doesn't make them any less Mexican than the people that grew up in poverty. There are all kinds of people in every single country. I believe the show is just trying to show that Mexico has a lot more to offer than just what the rest of the world thinks. I find it refreshing and I think everyone should give it a chance, the second episode was great. Columba makes this show awesome, by the way."
tt8871764,I don't speak any Mexican/Spanish or whatever but I watched the whole season from beginning to end reading the subtitles. The show is very well done and quite refreshing. You can see there is no script and these people are just being themselves and I loved it! I learned a lot about how Mexicans think and how they do stuff. I was very surprised at how the upper class lives in Mexico City. I did not know they lived so well. On tv they always just show poor Mexicans but the rich really live so well and are all well educated. It made me want to go to Mexico. Loved it and I really hope there is a season 2.....minus Hanna! Cant stand that fake woman. Super pretentious. The rest of the cast I loved.
tt8871764,"If i could give less than a star I would give them minus five but I can't,this tv show couldn't keep my attention for more than 1 episode, for me it was like a very lame copy of gossip girl but with older people and less interesting characters pathetic show Netflix very disappointed"
tt8871764,"Terrible show.....! 
It should no have been named Made in Mexico, or at least pick characters that really show what being made in Mexico is.
Horrible!"
tt12027008,Dont bother with the volume. Trust me. You'll want to throw the remote at your screen. Put on so calming backround nature music and wonder at the bizarre creatures.
tt12027008,"The narrators completely ruin the show. They try to be funny but it just pisses you off. Great footage though, just turn the sound off and listen to your own music."
tt12027008,Visually very good. Too bad the audio is bad. Narrator Mother Nature needs to go to Comedy School . Not family friendly with a fouled critters.
tt12027008,"The wonderful series is ruined by annoying voice over, even though I like the documentary I had to stop watching because the narration makes me cringe.
Please do a better narration and stop trying to be funny."
tt12027008,"'Absurd planet' is a great scenery of mesmerizing wonderful animals ruined by unfunny , childish and stupid narration which basically makes you angry and upset on an incredible footage wasted by stupidity.
It could have been one of the most beautiful documentaries to watch if only they left the animals to be funny on their own such as 'Dancing with the birds' .
Such actions just make it really hard to watch a full episode and enjoy what you are watching.
If a remake was done with a better narration and directory this review will definitely rise at least 7 stars depending on the result ."
tt12027008,"In the first episode, a 3 minute song about dung being rolled by a dung beetle. The jokes are for 4year olds, the footage is for nature loving adults. Watching it with the volume off and subtitles off is you're best option. The narration is so cringe worthy."
tt12027008,"Horribly yelling lady. Don't know if she is famous or not, but this way of speaking is like experiencing the end of a food market when they want to sell their last stuff.
Super annoying and totally distracting from the content. And speaking about the content, don't expect anything. That is the only way to survive a part of an episode.
And totally misplaced jokes too.
Really a waste of the sometimes nice camera work."
tt12027008,It is almost impossible to watch because of the voice over. The voice over is trying hard to be funny and relatable but it falls flat. I would normally watch a nature show to relax and learn but it seems like the concept of this show is the complete opposite.Although I can recommend showing to someone you hate.
tt12027008,"If all these 1 star reviewers knew where this show originated from then maybe they'd calm down on their high horse. It started from popular Wired column that ran for years called Absurd Animal of the Week. It was meant to be goofy and over the top but still getting information/interesting facts dolled out. I think it deserves a solid 6, not great not bad but middle of the road. A little weird is ok these days, stir the pot in an animal series to try different formulas."
tt12027008,"I had been wanting to watch this since I knew based off the title this wasn't going to be a typical nature show about typical animals.
It wasn't the Mother Nature narrator that got me. It was the stupid long dung beetle song that assaulted my brain, I held on only for my brain cells to continue being assaulted by idiotic voice overs that added nothing funny to the educational aspect. It infuriated me more than anything. I stared at my tv after the first episode, put on Our Planet and felt way better. What a waste of beautiful footage and information. They should have just left the original narrator and it would have been fine!"
tt12027008,"This is a funny and entertaining show for anyone who knows this isn't a serious nature documentary. I mean, the title makes it pretty obvious. There are a lot of wonderful nature docs available so no one should be they upset that this one is silly with toilet humor. My son enjoys it and it does give interesting facts about these odd creatures. It also has some humor that just the adults will understand. Again, if you're expecting a serious documentary about odd animals, this isn't it. Try Natural Curiosities instead."
tt12027008,We watched an episode as a family and really liked it. I don't understand all the bad reviews! The kids 4 & 9 were very engaged while the narrator's humor kept my husband and I watching instead of reaching for our phones.
tt12027008,My headline sums up the first thing that jumps out - Mother Nature's voice make this unwatchable. I noticed this in the first minute of watching and it just gets worse. Avoid this at all costs.
tt12027008,"The concept is great, and the 15min of footage i watched was really stunning and beautiful. Sadly i had to give up watching, since the narration is just unbearably cringy and took away all the focus from what was actually happening in the scenes.
And extra star for the visuals is well deserved though :)"
tt12027008,"The narrator/s and this poorly written script ruins everything, don't know who would watch this.To one of the reviewers below, this isn't about race and no one has said anything about race, that's just what you concluded. I just don't want anyone screaming ""funny"" things during a nature show, regardless of race. I'd love a show about weird and absurd things in nature if it was at least primarily informative."
tt12027008,What a waste of amazing footage with the stupid voices of what i assume are high school kids? I wouldn't even enjoy this as a 4 year old. There are other ways to make a show family friendly.Remake with different script and narrators and i will give it 7 stars.
tt12027008,"Would have been nice if it was somewhat interesting and not geared towards people with an IQ under 50. Like everyone else mentioned, the video quality is good but the narrator and pathetic humour attempts utterly destroy any redeeming qualities."
tt12027008,A cringeworthy narrator that belittles the integrity of the filming crew. A childish TV show lacking any substance.
tt12027008,"This is great for a family watch. It's brief, interesting, and has jokes for the kiddos as well as the adults. This is not the normal planet watching show. Do not seek relaxation here. The word Absurd is in the title, take it as it is."
tt12027008,"When i saw the banner on netflix, I thought it would be a perfect show to watch. I immediately remembered watching Dancing with the Birds which was an amazing show. I was expecting this series to kind of be a sequel or something but instead it was just lame jokes, voice acting and songs. It was so childish ""hahaa look dung beetles eat poopoo!"" If you wanted to make a kids show, then say it."
tt12027008,"Not sure why most reviewers compare this to serious documentaries. It is very obvious that it wants to go a different way it does that very well! The songs are catchy as hell! We wanted to have a soundtrack release for them!!
RIP Petey! You'll always be remembered!"
tt12027008,"Its goofy and not serious one bit but that's what we enjoyed about it. We watched it with out son, there were some bits that were slightly inappropriate but for the most part they went over his head and we got a good laugh. The footage is beautiful! Dont watch with children your not ready to answer questions about reproduction."
tt12027008,"I turned this on thinking it looked cool, but what I witnessed was so unbearable that I had to turn it off within the first 3 minutes. What is wrong with the producers that they thought this type of narration was desirable by any viewer? It's one of the most cringeworthy things I've ever heard in my life. If you want some incredible footage of amazing animals, this delivers, but only if you turn off the audio and subtitles. The only demographic I could see enjoying this are people who follow Annoying Orange and are looking for something even more annoying. This is essentially bottom of the barrel, worst of the worst YouTube audio content pasted over incredible wildlife footage."
tt12027008,Beautiful filming. But what the hell are the voice over doing.
tt12027008,Beautiful scenes ruined by commentary writting by a classroom of 7 year olds. I couldn't even finish the first episode. It physicaly hurts to watch.
tt1605790,"Unlike Hollywood, our Indian film Industry doesn't have many production houses backing children films with a decent budget. And the box office result of last few such films surely remains one big reason for that limited interest of Bollywood. So when Disney Films backs up a project made around a Children super hero Zokkomon, then one is bound to expect something great or extraordinary from the world famous pioneers of the genre.But once again the final result comes out to be far less than expected and the present project too is not capable of making any huge storm at the box office. In simple words, the film is not anything great but is not very bad either and is better than many sun-standard projects earlier churned out in the name of children films. Director Satyajit Bhatkal gives the right feel and look to the film along with some good visible production values. But if only he had given more time and stress upon the script, then the film could have been a rage among the kids.In a super-hero film the story is quite obvious that a person will get some super powers and then he will fight with all the cunning people and law breakers out there in a different outfit. But here the first drawback of the movie is that its main story plot borrows heavily from the one we have already seen in a well made children film by Vishal Bhardwaj, MAKDEE. Secondly, it takes too much time to bring in the super hero on the screen which should not be the case in such a film. And lastly though the super-hero sequences have been shot well but still they are not so entertaining or amusing for the kids to have a blast.However, a major and intelligent difference in the film is that the super-kid here doesn't have any illogical super natural powers, but he actually gets all those capabilities from the scientific gadgets designed by the 'Magic Uncle' living in the haunted house. But unfortunately the director doesn't give you any acceptable explanations for the gadgets made and thus they remain very questionable and un- convincing throughout. Further, a children film should essentially have very few but good hummable songs which ZOKKOMON doesn't. Moreover I am also strongly against using any death, dead body or cremation scenes in a children film creating some uneasy situations for the parents.Performance wise, Darsheel Safary perfectly portrays his role of a super-kid and looks confident along with Anupam Kher as always impressive in a double role. In fact many viewers may not even recognize him in his second role of the Magic Uncle. But the conviction with which he performs all his roles is indeed highly appreciable. Manjari Fadnis as Darsheel's Kittu Didi looks fresh and charming on the screen performing well. Tinnu Anand is fine in his routine kind of role and the kids supporting as Darsheel's friends are pleasant and appealing.On the whole, ZOKKOMON does have its own share of weak points and is not anything great offered in the genre of super-hero films. Still looking at its fine production values and good enjoyable performances you can watch it with your kids but preferably after its official DVD release."
tt1605790,"The second half of the film won me over.I wasn't liking 'Zokkomon' all that much up until that moment, it was a little all over the place due to it's messy plot and conflicting tone. Once, however, the cat gets let out the bag and the film's poster becomes relevant it actually turns into an enjoyable watch.Darsheel Safary is a solid choice to play Kunal, he has the cheeky but good side that's necessary. Anupam Kher is also noteworthy in this, though I have two weird things to note about him: I had no idea he was playing a dual role and didn't click that he portrays Jess' father in 2002's 'Bend It Like Beckham'. Not sure how I didn't realise at least one of those two things...The special effects are excellent, I thought - particularly for Zokkomon. The score and cinematography are nothing special, but there is one tremendous shot featuring a train going past a waterfall at one point; the song ""Suno Brother"" fits well for its montage, also.Improved writing and a most consistent plot would've elevated my feelings towards this. Still, it's a film I did just about enjoy."
tt1605790,Just saw Zokkomon on Netflix - This film is worth a watch as it has a decent plot. You'll not be disappointed and you'll get to learn something from this film as well. It's a 👍 from me.
tt11754464,"Another movie by indonesian youtubers but same as usual, sucks.the scene/frame changed too fast when the actors are talking so I can't focused myself, very poor editing. it's more like watching a sketch than a box office movie 😂 i guess the director brings his yt style to a box office movie.The acting is of course awful, especially the tommy lim guy which deliver a very cringy feeling while watching him. I found that the actresses acting is not too bad compared to the actors. Even the director acting is just tremendously awful. They treat a box office movie like a youtube short movie 😂Story? Trying to make a plot twist which only make the movie worsen coz there is no actual plot point no real problem and like i said it's more like a sketch, not a continuous story, the MC are just... Ambiguously stupid, imagine in the whole movie the MC didn't have feeling anymore for his GF and then suddenly it appears with no trigger(s) at all wtf 😂Anyway, watch it yourself and consider it as an atonement 😂No offense, chandraliow is one of the best idn ytber and among my favourite but i have to say that he still miles away from becoming a good director of box office movies. and this movie? Not a good start, not at all.And please stop using youtuber as an actor, i mean it 😂"
tt11754464,"Its too painful to watch... Argghhh !!.I finished the movie but, the jokes were randomly corny. Not funny. And the plot story wasn't important in the end of the story. It shows you how ""bucin"" can you be, and you need to fight it, but you don't..The twist was okay, however it the storyline made me feel like the ""twist"" doesn't important anymore..Its like ""owh... Okay"" moment"
tt11754464,Extremely below expectation that the director of this movie promises. Just like another low budget indonesian movie with cringy comedy and very predictable happily ever after ending
tt11754464,"Its not just troll who are giving it bad reviews
this movie wasnt terrible but definitely below average. honestly, i really wanted to enjoy it and i was hoping for better but it just didn't do it for me at all. boring storyline with so poor script writing, awful acting and the jokes arent funny at all"
tt11754464,"With high expectation because the promotion alert of the movie..especially what Chandra Liow as director said before..we really dissapointing of this debut ..bad story', Weak all the way.., lot big star cameos but wasted, the acting is below average, and one thing they can't prove that the reliable YouTuber is also a talented actor, far from being talented..this is a bad precedent for Netflix to rethink including Indonesian movie impressions worldwide distributed. 1/10 or 0.5/10"
tt11754464,"Bad script, worst acting, too many camera move, trash jokes, cringe, and why i watch this movie. And WTF so many rate 10/10 ?? is that all the team of film ?? LOL"
tt11754464,"I think this film will be AWESOME but yeah, it's SUCK! I have only watched this film for 15 minutes but I am not strong enough with many cringe scenes with trash jokes. It doesn't make me laugh at all"
tt11754464,"This movie has a really weak story, with bad acting from the cast, and crisp jokes.
I feel like the one giving 10/10 score might be the one involved in the movie itself, because a rational people will think that this far from good movie."
tt11754464,"A generic Indonesian romantic comedy that ultimately turns into a thriller and ends up being an almost Mexican romantic comedy.
It's about four bossy friends who sign up for a course to stop being it and have to pass several tests (silly and totally out of context) to stop being it.
Predictable like all of its kind.
Quality.
Terrible performances that fall into the absurdity and ridicule of how exaggerated they are.
Light sexual jokes and one or two moments are laughable, the rest is sad.
He tries to talk about love and freedom and fails.
Avoidable Sunday, for when you don't have something else to do with your time."
tt11754464,"Cringe jokes, garing, jalan ceritanya gak dikupas dgn baik, plot twist nya maksa, moral nya gak dalem. 2 point only for color grading and cinematic. Sisanya trash"
tt11754464,I like the whole film with an unexpected twist plot throughout the film I am quite entertained
tt11754464,"I must said, I did put an expectation for this movie as Chandra said this will be good.
He's right, the cinematography is amazing, the cast played their roles almost perfect, everything is good but two:The storyline itself, while in my pov it's an essential part of a movie. It's indeed good at the beginning, but the rest wasn't so good. It seems like they forced several events to happen when it wasn't needed. The worst part, actually, was the twist in the ending. It's supposed to make the viewer shock, however it's just didn't make any sense and, once again, it seems forced.Then, the jokes. Some of it just wasn't in a right time and some just didn't necessary.Last, this movie worth to watch to spend your leisure time and don't put any expectations in it, you'll be disappointed."
tt11754464,"Actor 1/10, Script 1/10, Cinematography 5/10, Editing 6/10 . Enjoy"
tt11754464,"bad jokes (however, Tommy did some good scene),Jovi acting is disappointedstory line is terribleI expect more from Chandra, that's why I feel disappointed.Lucky never going to cinema..."
tt11754464,"3/10. 3 is for the cinematography. Bad acting, cringe jokes, horrible plot. This movie is so awful :(."
tt11754464,"Dont even waste a minute of your time to watch this movie, please just skip. The acting is over, the story is less. Nothing else to say"
tt11754464,"What the hell of the jokes? seriously brother, this movie is the worst story ever i have ever seen. DISSAPOINTED TO CHANDRA"
tt11754464,"I still can't get why people really hate this movie, it's actually not that bad. I mean if you're expecting something like a romantic drama of course you can't find it here, it's a comedy, and I like this movie cause it makes me happy, it makes me laugh. People say this is a boring movie but after I watch it, I enjoy it, I enjoy the plot, the cinematography, the music and everything. But the bad thing is this kind of joke is not the kind of 'Indonesian joke' I mean not many indonesians like and understand this kind of joke. Maybe that's why people don't like it but I think giving one out of ten is too cruel. Like what the hell, you never watch a comedy or what? There are a lot of Indonesian movies that are worse than this and they get better grades. Trust me if you ""open your mind"" you'll enjoy this movie"
tt11754464,Over promise and bad script. Thank god it's on Netflix so you don't need spend your time to wasted.
tt11754464,"Not read any review before, coming here after watched the movie.
As ordinary audience, as audience that watch movie without much thinking. I feel it's not that bad, quite entertained. It's still fun to watch, you need to try watch by your self.
Idk maybe it is subjective, because I am standup comedian audience and also watch chandra and friend channel sometimes.. it's make me feel relate with the joke"
tt11754464,"There's a lot of jokes relevant ONLY IF you're Indonesian and only if you know these Youtube personalities. So if you're none of these please stop criticizing ""it's not funny"".You won't find Indonesian standup comedians funny anyways because you don't get the joke."
tt11754464,"It'll be better if i don't have high expectations, but i trust chandraliow that much because i knew how good his youtube is. the acting is sucks, the plot and storyline is under mediocre. im trying to laugh or even entertained watch this but i can't. but atleast there's something i can appreciate, cinematography. that's it. hope chandra's could find better actor and scriptwriter"
tt11754464,SERIOUSLY ?? so proud with this movie ? man you better out youtube now. LOL
tt11754464,Please just delete this movie from Netflix. I won't watch this movie again even someone pay me.
tt9014248,"Sometimes it is very funny, but the plot is generic and uninteresting."
tt9014248,"Another one of those mexican films that are made so that the government spends every last cent in formulaic, no brainer crap.Don't waste your money watching this. It's exactly as dull and pointless as the poster, where everyone looks completely fake and posing.How many times can you laugh at a ""Godinez"" (cubicle dweller?). Yes, we know about tupperware. We know about the clothing. Yes, it has already been shown in at least one more movie (with Godinez on the title).The only fair thing about the movie is Alejandro Suarez, but then again, this is not saying much.Technically inept and crude, stupid, badly filmed and dumb. Don't bother."
tt9014248,"I do not speak much Spanish, so I had to rely on the subtitles...The movie was funny and entertaining. I would give it more around a 7, but considering it's 4 rating I figured a 10 may balance it out. Considering I would watch and enjoy this again, I'm fine with dropping the 10 on it.I found the acting to be very good, while a touch over the top, but that is clearly what they were aiming for.If you go into this expecting to take it all that seriously, it's not the movie for you.Great for fans of comedy and technology as a pair."
tt14770480,"Was this supposed to be about we the people in the United States of America? Pretty poor interpretation of America's Constitution and Bill of Rights. I couldn't even get past the third episode. The Declaration of Independence (not dependency), Constitution and Bill of Rights was written so that the common Man even if they could not read, could be read this and completely understood its full meanings. Educational but in my opinion it's teach people that the government is there to help you in all aspects of your life."
tt14770480,"I would consider myself a pretty strong conservative but I like to think I have an open mind. I did my best to watch this with open mind a put aside my intial bias.That being said, this was way over politicized and it didn't have to be. The information was decent, especially for children, but it was so clearly written from a progressive prospective. The majority of the show was fine but there were obvious overtones to BLM and anti gun beliefs. These ideas weren't the main focus, thankfully but they didn't need to be there.I gave this 3 stars because I HATE the idea of trying to influence children to believe one way or another which this is trying to do. Again, the vast majority of the information is fine, it's just the creators added political overtones that did not have to be there, hence the three stars."
tt14770480,"This is on4e of the poorest interpretations of the founders documents ever!This has the opinion of the gimme population all over it. This is not what it means in any way , shape, or form!"
tt14770480,"This is an awful interpretation of the Bill of Rights and Constitution. I put this on for my 4 year old and turned it off after the first episode until I could review every episode with my wife. I know Netflix gives almost everything a green light but even knowing that, my wife and I were stunned that people were paid for creating this."
tt14770480,"I was shocked how bored I was when watching this that I researched all the media reviews raving about what a great series this was and Netflix pumping as their most ""popular"" series (first slot in the section). It would seem appropriate that these faux positive pumps are a result of the Obamas producing this. This is not teaching US history and citizenship, see for yourself, but I couldn't even make it past the 2nd episode."
tt14770480,"This is stupid and the songs are the worst. Its trying to teach kids to demand immediate gratification, but its so bad no kid will probably watch which is a good thing. The songs are awful. Don't waste your time."
tt14770480,"This show has been described as a modern-day Schoolhouse Rock and they're absolutely right.'We the People' features unique animation in every single episode. From psychedelic visuals, to photo-animation similar to Monty Python, to a lo-fi aesthetic. Every episode brings something new to the table.And it's the same with the music. Each episode has a different music artist sing about different parts of the constitution, bill of rights, and so on. My favorite episode is the one on the Bill of Rights. Adam Lambert is one of my favorite artists and Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez managed to create an upbeat, catchy, rocking description of the first 10 amendments.This is definitely educational and I think teachers should show it in classrooms, the kids will love it."
tt14770480,"If you're rating this low because you think it's woke, then you're entirely too childish to be leaving a review. This was fine. Nothing was inherently wrong with this. Just because your seventh grade social studies teacher lied to you, doesn't mean the show is wrong. The rating literally says Y7 so I don't know why grown adults are saying ""it's too simple"". It's clearly meant for children."
tt14770480,"The design and animation is gorgeous and creative. The music and poetry is exciting and moving. Each episode focuses on different aspects of the US government with modern context. Great for kids.The people who don't like it are typically dogmatic right wingers who will hate on anything the Obamas have anything to do with. The content isn't partisan, but with anything about politics, extremists will be triggered. You know every fox cultist will turn it off as soon as they mention Hamilton was an immigrant.The overall message is that part of responsible citizenship is being involved and understanding the system of law. They cover the basics and why it's important in an approachable, entertaining way."
tt14770480,"This easy to watch series of music videos focuses on individual empowerment, and citizenship. It is clearly corporate art, but still enjoyable when you overlook that. The animation and music is all good and pretty for it's genre, though that depends on personal taste. The ""Immigration"" song bops, but gets repetitive. I must note that the majestic and energetic ""Bill of Rights"" song, and the roaring ""Three Branches of Government"" song are both real bangers (although, there are many things to be said about the depiction of Supreme Court justices as ethereal beings). The visual storytelling of ""The First Amendment"" is understandable to anyone who's had their right to speak freely threatened."
tt14770480,From an aesthetics and musical pov it's great but it simply does not educate to the level that every American SHOULD have of their government. This would've been so much better if it wasn't a musical but instead a 10 hour miniseries on government structure while still making it entertaining.
tt14770480,"For people who want their kids to understand how our government is supposed to work, this is a wonderful series. My children loved the artwork and music, and the songs were beautiful and uplifting. Clearly influenced by School House Rock, this is a delightful modern series the whole family can appreciate."
tt14770480,"The show was intended to provide an interesting, purposeful, fun but brief introduction into American and state government, the laws thereof and the hope and inspiration provided when utilized properly! The music and poetry are awesome and the visual diversity is everything! I say kudos to Nee, Barris, Mr. & Mrs. Obama and to all involved! A modern day school house rock that I pray will stay with generations to come!!!! Great job!"
tt14770480,"Absolutely fantastic and groovy introduction to a life of responsibility. Perfect for youth engagement. Well done to all those involved. This series is recommended. Ignoring the poor, obviously politically motivated negative reviews is also recommended. Proudly conservative, but this is sincerely, mostly masterful art."
tt14770480,"I feel I can make an educated review as I have a 12 year old daughter and teach fifth grade, which seems to be about the age the videos are intended for - they love the style and songs!As a matter of fact, my daughter is the one who introduced me to the series. It is more modern than other civics video options and starts great conversations. I don't believe it was created to be the entire education on a topic, so I'm not sure why the negative commenters are disappointed in its lack of depth. It is a great multi-sensory beginning to a lesson on civics, which is required by every state that I'm aware of.Some reviewers seem to be dancing around the fact that there are many people of color represented, which is an incredible positive for my students, but diverges from the usual curriculum."
tt3828220,"This year, as for being an avid fan of International productions, I decided to be a good citizen and support the Local Production. Every year in my country there is this Festival called MMFF or Metro Manila Film Festival who exhibit line up of movies to be presented during Christmas Holidays. I'm not an avid fan of it but ever since last year, hearing a good rumor that movies we're great and of course I have watched it through local television channel, I decided to watch one movie. That movie is Praybeyt Benjamin 2 (2014). The first sequel was really good and as many people in my country say ""please, have a sequel"", our wish was granted and by 25th December of 2014, the movie was released alongside others and it was a hit. Afternoon of that day I decided to watched it but as the movie roll in the screen and as time passed by, I tell to myself ""Yes, this movie is a hit on the people face"". The movie rendition of the honorable soldiers of my country was turn into something unimaginable as what the movie render.The movie shows nothing but lame humor and disgusting effort that it might save the movie from being such a pain in the eyes. As I seat more for another half an hour, I came to a direct resolve that I should get up and just get out of the room. I pity all the people who wasted good bucks and pay for something ungrateful and very unprofessional film who will only hurt their eye and shower themselves with many unimaginable bad humor created by it's writer or the one who is acting. I can't believe even the President of the Republic of the Philippines have watched this such low rated movie. As the news stated this morning, they are proud (ABS-CBN) to announce that their film profited P200 Million. Profited in a way they throw a bomb on the mass public and they catch it, I as well did caught it. This gave me a resolve never to trust local movies again. A total regret, disgust and disappointment. A movie alike this is not worth any penny. Lame production and script editors should try going to college once more. Overall, for those people who are idiotic enough to give this movie a low ratings, I'm a good reviewer of movies and I at least have the credibility to give this 3/10."
tt3828220,"'The Amazing Praybeyt Benjamin'or Praybeyt Benjamin 2 is a fitting movie to watch for a family who just wants to hang out together. It's purpose is give entertainment to the kids and adults who doesn't mind mindless jokes just for the sake of entertaining themselves.But for those who don't want their intelligent's to be insulted, then please avoid this movie at all cost, even only buying a popcorn will be more worth it. The story didn't made any sense, the pacing of the jokes are totally random to the point you get tired of it. And there are jokes you can't even relate to, which is not fitting for it's target audience.Gay jokes will give you mixed feelings if you just want to laugh at it or be annoyed. The actors felt like being force to their roles and character development was nonexistent except for the main character but it felt pointless in the end.The drama scenes didn't help either because out of nowhere a joke will be executed which is unnecessary. All of it are cliché's too so it will only give you an impression of ""meh, whatever"".Vice Ganda did a good job as an actor in this film mind you. It felt like his acting was natural like you would say this movie was made just to fit his comedian persona. His presence kept the audience entertained till the end.Overall this is a bad movie. Vice Ganda pretty much carried the show with his name alone and it's Christmas season. It is bound to be watched by families who just want to watch a funny movie."
tt3828220,"My vote is 1 out of 10 but if there was a 0, it would be 0.The Amazing Praybeyt Benjamin is an insult to the realm of cinema. The jokes were rarely funny and out of place. The shifting of moods is absolutely terrible as their attempt to go from funny to serious does not work at all. Vice Ganda was overacting nearly every scene and his only asset is his hyper-speed-talking mouth, which made his performance all the more annoying. Richard Yap could easily be replaced by a rock and no one would notice as his acting is stiffer that a stick. The worst part of this movie is the child actor, man what a performance, no emotion was express by his face at all, no anger, sadness, happiness or whatever. NONE! Just line reading. Why he was nominated for some ""Best Child Actor"" award is a mystery we will never solve. His performance was the worst I have ever seen in a child actor. Perhaps the only acting that was not as cringe-worthy was the villain's which was not even that good. The only character well-developed was the main character's and no one else's. Overall, I would recommend burning your DVD copy of this film or permanently deleting your pirated copy of it and just watch your dog take a crap as it has the same amount of entertainment in it."
tt3828220,"James Bimby Aquino's understandably bad acting aside, ('cause he's still a child) ""The Amazing Praybeyt Benjamin"" is still good. It delivers laughs and touching messages though a great plot and great conclusions to the plot we got were absent."
tt3828220,"'The Amazing Praybeyt Benjamin' bears no evident effort to present something new, much less deliver something better than any of past Wenn Deramas film. Deramas has heavily relied on the same old formula for years, and while he lost hold over the intellectual and high-brow comedy followers, his works never failed to dominate the mass market that easily get drawn to his mindlessly entertaining brand of comedy.In 'The Amazing Praybeyt Benjamin', his magic once again works effortlessly. His partnership with Vice Ganda proves to be an unmistakable key ingredient to his success. Here, Vice Ganda is joined by Alex Gonzaga, Richard Yap and Bimby Yap. Alex Gonzaga proves to be a reliable comic support, while Richard Yap provides mostly the 'kilig' element in the movie. Storywise, there is nothing much to see, at its heart is still Benjamin, now consumed by fame and pride, and from there the film attempts to deliver lessons on humility and family. Ultimately, though, its the endless punchlines, spoofs and unexpected cameos, that make this film a worthwhile holiday experience."
tt5710042,"Mercy wasn't necessarily a bad film, indeed the opening twenty minutes or so were rather intriguing, a nice build up, good motives for family feud, but once it started unravelling it transformed into nonsense. At times I was reminded of You're Next, but at no stage did it reach those levels of gripping excitement.It wasn't difficult to follow, but the realisation of who was behind the home invasion was dealt with in a way that you can only describe as heavy handed, the reveal three quarters of the way through was very silly, I couldn't take it seriously. Too many unanswered questions at the end, were all brothers aware of what was going on? Never fully answered.Quite well acted, with decent production values, the masks were very effective, but with those, as with the rest of the film, there's nothing new here. A little flat, 5/10"
tt5710042,"I caught this on Netflix and as is usually the case, it's another pile of crap movie that only Netflix can offer up. You would think a service that you pay for could actually offer some decent movies, but instead they give us B movie crap like this.I was totally frustrated by this movie as I never understood what was going on, and there was no explanation at the end. It had potential, and had they given the viewer some idea as to what was going on, it might have worked.If you run across this one on Netflix, save yourself some time. Pass on this mess. You'll thank me."
tt5710042,"I am told that American Netflix has a far better selection of movies; good movies, i.e. ones with a coherent plot, good acting and a sense of dramatic timing. However I have seen enough of Canadian Netflix to assert that many movies on the service are simply filler that must have been made by wealthy ""wanna-be"" film producers or charming con artists who managed to cajole wealthy friends to part with their money and finance a film. All the imagination and timing went into the making of the trailer for this. Do not be fooled. You have been warned. I'll give a nod to Mercy's maker for the first 20 minutes or so: he did a capable, if pedestrian, job of setting up the dramatic contours for a conflict of some kind that does not end well. Had the remainder of the movie followed this arc (without resorting to a clumsy back-in-time approach to explain what just happened which left me confused at various points) then I would have rated this a 6 (for mildly diverting, at times intense, but I am glad I didn't drop $12 to see this at a theatre)."
tt5710042,"A deathbed-drama turns into a home-invasion thriller, and dark secrets are revealed -- all to little effect -- in the clumsy and not-quite- worthwhile ""Mercy.""The plot involves four brothers who convene upon the family homestead as their mother nears death. The patriarch fathered only two of the boys. The other two are children from the dying woman's previous marriage; their father died under mysterious circumstances, leaving her a sizeable sum of money. There's a rift between both pairs of half-brothers, a rift which is aggravated by the living patriarch, who wishes to keep the inheritance to himself and his biological children.The drama plays-out with quiet tension, leaving us with a few too many questions -- like: The four of them have been provided with what appears to be a DIY euthanasia-kit by a local doctor. It's established that they all believe their mother is suffering. And yet, they unanimously object to the use of euthanasia. It seems this may stem from religious belief. And yet, the way they suspiciously eye one another about it, and the way the DIY kit keeps getting thrown away and then ""significantly"" re-appearing, it seems like all isn't what it appears to be.Well, and it's not, quite frankly. There are a few twists to this tale. The first is a home-invasion, which happens quite abruptly and changes the feel of the film. The second is the reveal of the identity of the invaders, which is more surprising than I had guessed. The third concerns the true nature of that euthanasia kit.Ultimately, having seen the full scope of the plot, I can see what someone may have seen in this material. It's a crafty setup. But it's terribly underserved by both the writing and the execution. A better version of this film would have had sharper dialogue and more closely-observed characters. The four brothers presented by this film are fairly generic guys; each is given a defining trait or two, but no meaningful dialogue is exchanged between them, other than whatever is necessary to advance the plot. A better film would have traced the deep rift between these siblings; it might have referenced a specific event in the past which touched them all in different ways; it might have said something about the nature of familial division. Instead, we're given four brothers who talk like crooks getting ready to pull a heist, each one suspicious of the others. We're given no insight into their personal lives.A better version of this film would also have played a bit more with the religious themes. There is a definite ironic comparison to be made between the dad's sternness, his presumed moralistic idealism, and the kind of faith which becomes part of the film's final act.A better film would also have made those final-act twists work better. These twists should be quite shocking -- but as delivered by this film, they just leave us feeling a little puzzled and unsatisfied. We need to feel, more strongly, the ironic nature of what happens at the end in the mother's room. A better film might have done this by setting-up certain signifiers earlier in the film, certain things which might have raised questions or doubts, so that when the final act pulls these sudden reversals, we can better appreciate what's happening and it doesn't feel so... well, kind of arbitrary.A better film would also have utilized the cinematography and the editing better. ""Mercy"" isn't exactly an ugly film, but it's a film without a strong sense of visual direction. This is a story which involves things both spoken and unspoken, secrets, and misdirection. Some clever camera-work and thoughtful editing could have helped to tell the story, could have ""said"" the things that the characters themselves aren't saying. Instead, ""Mercy"" gives us the flat, affectless, somewhat-shaky look which has become the hallmark of the generic, low- budget home-invasion thriller.Overall, it's not great film. It's barely a good one. There were certainly some promising elements here, but those are quite underserved by this film's thoughtless, generic execution."
tt5710042,"I'm surprised at all the one star reviews - it is definitely not nearly that bad. I thought this was a good thriller, and I loved the 'twist'. I really enjoyed the conclusion. It was a little hard to follow at times, and I could have done without the short start, re-do, and ending format. However, I don't feel like that ruined the movie. I would recommend giving it a try - it's not perfect, but it's also not the worst movie ever as many reviews would have you believe."
tt5710042,"The premise of this story was intriguing and that was the only reason I watched until the end. But the execution of the film was awful. It was too choppy and sketchy and didn't explain things properly at all. I get the gist but the 'twist' wasn't really a 'twist' at all. I thought the 'twist' was evident from the beginning. They needed to go into a lot more depth here with a film like this. And I'm disappointed because it had potential to be a really good film. The beginning is slow and 49mins in, I still had no idea what was going on. Major plot holes, too many unanswered questions. A big thumbs down from me."
tt5710042,"If you have absolutely nothing to do, watch it. If however you feel the urge to pull your fingernails out with a pair of pliers then I suggest you will have more satisfaction with the latter. Wasted a Sunday afternoon with this movie. Good on ya Netflix. It could always be worse though. I might have taken my lady to the cinema and spent money for the two of us to be disappointed beyond belief. 90 percent of the movie was filmed in dark conditions and it was very hard to follow the story as the characters were unrecognizable most of the time and you didn't know if the masked guys were getting on top or the brothers actually got a win. Sad to see that in our day and age with all the technology available that someone can get a movie so wrong with camera work alone. Then there was the acting. At least everything about the movie was consistent. Disappointed Disappointed Disappointed. If you read my review and still go ahead and watch this rubbish then you cant say you haven't been warned. Hey look.... golf is on channel 2. At least it will be better than what I've just put myself through."
tt5710042,"Not the literal one that is. But the question that I reckon some have raised is not to be taken lightly. Can you enjoy/watch a movie where it's hard to root for the ""good"" guys? If you'd actually call them that. There is quite a bit going on and you probably have read what this is about, I'll still keep it as if you haven't.Not every movie is meant to be simple. That doesn't mean you have to accept the road it takes and see that it is good. But if you are willing to accept certain things and take this as life, but also larger than life, with a really crazy twist and some despicable human beings, and a movie that will try to confuse you in the end ... you may be able to call it a satisfying movie watching experience. I know I can"
tt5710042,"I won't go too in depth on the plot of the movie, since quite a few have already done so in these reviews. This movie had a few interesting ideas that I personally haven't encountered too often. However I found the movie's story writing to be very sloppy. 
There wasn't much to figure as a viewer, so a lot of the suspense was lost. You could tell the jumpscares we're coming a mile away. They spent no time developing the characters, so you didn't care when anything happens to them. For me personally, by the time I learned their name, they were gone. 
If I had to describe this movie in two words it would sloppy and, most importantly, BORING. Seems as though Netflix is no longer concerned with the quality of their own content. Big surprise."
tt5710042,"I.. I really don't know what to say. The movie was okay, but just okay and a tad on the more negative side. I would've probably given 6/10 if the movie hadn't been so freaking dark and the actors didn't look so alike, especially in the dark. The plot was actually really surprising. I wish there was more of a back story, but you can do just so much in 87 minutes. I cannot say I feel like I wasted my time, the movie was watchable but I cannot give a better grade."
tt5710042,"I came across this film streaming on Netflix, so I decided to check it out. It was a complete waste of time. It moves at a snail's pace, particularly for the first 45 minutes. The producers must have made the pacing very slow to qualify it as a 90-minute feature film. This story could have been told in one hour. The non-dialogue scenes should be time compressed to reduce the overall running time of the film. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
tt5710042,"Not well written or executed. The acting was fine, but the characters were not well developed. For example, we just get bits and pieces of conversation. Nothing is ever hashed out, which is frustrating due to the presentation of tension between the characters. Other things just don't make sense. Why plot a home invasion at the rare evening when the entire family (6 and a guest) all happen to be there? Victim one in the woods stabs his perpetrator with a knife then leaves the knife in the body rather than cutting the ropes around his wrists. Another brother uncovers a motorcycle from the shed, and oh my, there happens to also be a loaded gun there as well. One step brother reveals to the other that he and his real brother are cut out of the inheritance-why? what's the purpose? That would completely work against the final twist of the plot. There's more, but hopefully I've said enough to keep you from wasting your time."
tt5710042,"Waste of time. These movies need to be sued.Desperate attempt at a suspenseful drama, but it falls on its face."
tt5710042,"Judging by (most of) the other reviews I watched a different movie. The pictures, the atmosphere, the soundtrack are top-notch. The characters might be a little flat, stereotyped.The movie is categorized as drama, mystery, thriller. I'd rather omit the category ""mystery"". It's not really a mystery. The concept of the movie is interesting; sometimes it doesn't seem to be thoroughly thought through. The story, though, is thought-provoking. I will definitely watch it again!"
tt5710042,I don't know why this was made. I think whoever made this got confused and could keep the story on track.Its a total waste of time. When story starts it seems then something mystical is going to happen or some secret is going to be revealed and suddenly story collapses.
tt5710042,"Poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted. Save your time and watch anything else."
tt5710042,"At some point i thought ""mercy"" is not different than any other cheap-ideas movie, but when the things turned upside down to reveal the truth behind this family, i found out that this movie deserve a good rating!"
tt5710042,"Absolutely Positively One Of The Worst Movies EverOne Star - AwfulThis movie repeats scenes over and over again.The acting is horrible.Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT waste your time watching this movie. Netflix should be ashamed of themselves to even offer this movie to the public. No name actors should have skipped this one as I am sure it was NOT helpful to their careers.Again, don't waste your time with this GARBAGE.It is almost criminal that this movie was made for public consumption.AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL...!!!I repeat - AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL...!!!Do NOT bother."
tt6950250,"If you're have trouble sleeping, this is the movie to help you fall asleep.From overstretched lines, too many unnecessary scenes especially the flash backs, to actors staring blankly at each other and saying nothing for over 30 seconds, to music that do not match most of the scenes. Only Joke Silva's acting managed to saved the day.There's no comedy in here and no romance. Do I'm shocked that this movie is called a ""romantic comedy"". In all, I washed 1 hour 39 mind of my time. Not impressed."
tt6950250,"I'm the first one to support Nollywood movies and I'm excited to see them offered more on Netflix. However!! Netflix must be more selective with their choice of movies to offer. This movie looked good, the preview had potential. Boy was I wrong!! First off the acting made zero sense, long pauses of actors smiling and looking at each other, flash backs from
the past that made no sense, the music choice was not fitting with the scene of the movie. Just bad! I fell asleep within the first 30 minutes!
Whatever happened to the Nollywood movies from years past? You can find much better movies from the early 2000's on YouTube for free instead of bothering with these ridiculous, nonsense movies!! People please do better and stop wasting our time!!"
tt6950250,"Better watch a gif file on loop for 1 hour and 30 minutes. You'll get less bored and annoyed. Cast? I can act better than everybody in this ""movie"" and I'm not an actor. The director and montage? There are so many logical steps in this ""movie"" that it was merely impossible to watch. Too many scenes were cut out from the final version, that you had no idea what was going on. And no, this is not a romantic comedy. It is neither romantic, nor funny. Worst 90 minutes of my life ever. I recommend you to NOT watch this thing."
tt6950250,"Tuesday 25 February 2020. I have not watch many all African cast films. I was scrolling on my Net Flicks channel and this film caught my eyes. I am glad that I watch it. I like it from the beginning to the end and lead actress, Joselyn Dumas is very good in her role, all natural and although the other actress with the long fake hair is pretty, but Joselyn is very pretty, classy and stunning to look at. I hope to see more of her. She should be in American movies or television shows. Actress Joke Silva did a good job as the mother in-law. I would have been disappointed if the two main characters would not have gotten back together."
tt6950250,"I've watched this movie on Netflix so many times and I know I'm gonna watch it again soon. If you're a hopeless romantic like myself or love happy endings and undying love, this movie is definitely for you.I loved the actors too! They all interpreted their roles really well. OC Ukeje and Jocelyn Dumas acting was very believable. The soundtrack and video at the end by OC Ukeje got me vibing.This movie had the perfect mix of romance and humour. Slow maybe, but definitely worth every second."
tt6950250,I don't about you all!! But this movie was so good
tt6950250,"While it's not Oscar worthy, it's a pretty good movie. Sound track is good, there's chemistry between the actors , some funny clips, some predictable clips too but then few Nigerian movie are unpredictable!
It's an improvement from the usual drag that Nollywood often offers!"
tt7981492,"Ever wonder what Kenny G would look like if he were to be possessed? Wonder no more.
Some parts were good. Others made me wonder why I haven't stopped the movie.
I really didn't care how it ended... so I opened Pinterest and had it playing on in the background.
Husband fell asleep."
tt7981492,This is a bad mix between Guillermo del Toro's mamma and anabelle from the conjuring. Nothing special about this film... probably if you have nothing to do you May watch this one... do not have high expectations...
tt7981492,The story line wasn't as good as the other movies and it was definitely not as scary...
tt7981492,The concept of the movie is way behind 80s horror movies. I reckon that I can act better than the cast in the movie. It was the worst movie I've ever seen in recent 2 years. I think a personal Youtuber can create a better film than this. Maybe you just can go watch Youtube instead.
tt7981492,"Extremely funnny movie, which starts of with cheap thrills in the first half and moves on to become a conjuring spoof with funny cgi and some extremely funny acting and it also has a very irritating kid"
tt7981492,"This is a very cheesy but colorful and an adventure full horror movie. I would say this is targeted more towards pre-teens. Don't expect much though, the writing and acting is garbage."
tt7981492,"Overrated, boring ,stupid plot film. No point to waste time for this trash."
tt7981492,Cheesy script. Acting is totally bad. A conjuring wannabe kind of movie. Waste of time.
tt7981492,"Sabrina is a neat little film ruined by a number of flaws that prevent it from being something really special.This Indonesian made Netflix original at first glimpse you'd assume is a killer doll-esque movie, but that couldn't be further from the truth. If you're looking for Chucky or Robert the doll you'll be sorely disappointed, this is more your possession type film.Now regarding the possession sub-genre I generally don't like them, the tropes they hold tend to bore me but thankfully they throw most of them out the window here and go for something somewhat more exciting.Now I can't say much about the plot without giving something away so I'll not bother. I will however say that when the story is finally laid out in front of you I think you'll be pleasantly surprised, it's well constructed and very much not predictable.Again as mentioned sadly the film does have its flaws, a couple regard the story and one near the end took this down from a potential 7 to 6. Another is the lack of consistency, it plays out like a serious horror yet has moments of ultra cheesiness that ruin the atmosphere altogether.Regardless this is a very fun, exciting and oddly scary in places little film that is not what you'd expect it to be. Despite my underwhelming rating I would recommend this.The Good:Surprisingly well constructed plotSome genuinely creepy momentsThe Bad:Some poor cameraworkBizarre soundtrack choicesOddly cheesy in placesSilly finaleI struggled to tell the two leading ladies apartThings I Learnt From This Movie:I'm left wondering if the casting director specifically sought out the sickest looking girl they could for the roleDemonic possession causes nose growth"
tt7981492,"The movie has a potential of being a scary movie but creativity and mastering are not there.
The doll is the scariest toy I have ever seen.
Production of a ghost, ohhh gosh what was that? Original Exorcist 1973 without CGI did a phenomenal job in creating Regan spooky.
Play of several actors is... people, get another jobs. Bad dialogues made the movie silly. Bad lighting and sound.
How performers' running on foot from factory to the house and back. I thought the toy factory is located miles from the house.
They got on Netflix though. Terrible."
tt7981492,"Forget getting scared, this movie is hilarious. Im seriously rating it 10 for humor, it has been a while since i laughed so hard with ANY movie. Thank you."
tt7981492,"This movie doesn't make any sense, that's why it turns into a comedy movie, please, don't watch"
tt7981492,"You know when you wanna watch something but like using only 30% of your brain? That's the movie.
Bad movie, but a good distraction.
It's not actually scary though."
tt7981492,"I was excited when this movie was released . but after seeing it ? Worst worst worst .Yeah, it's not good . Jeremy Thomas ? he can't act at all ."
tt7981492,"Sabrina consists of typical horror cliches here and there. Some good scares but not a unique story. The plot consists of the usual ""possessed person."" In this case, includes a doll, which of course seems similar to films like Annabelle. The story tends to extend itself for what it is. A story that can be probably cut shorter but goes too long for what it is, making the plot weak. The shots were alright, not too fancy but not a terribly shot film. Good job to the make up but the effects seemed to be stuck on a budget certain scenes, which shows in some scenes. Overall, the movie is just okay. A flat 5/10 for good scares but not a great story"
tt7981492,"Una de las películas más ridículas que he visto en mi vida, es un 0"
tt7981492,"I've seen dozens of possessed doll movies and this is by far one if the worst I've ever seen. I actually almost fell asleep. I'm terrified of dummies so i figured I'd get a good scare, and goosebumps made me jump more than this nonsense."
tt7981492,"This is a great horror/supernatural tale with great make-up, acting, and cinematography. If you are a true fan of international film, then look no further for the next two hours! You will not be disappointed."
tt7981492,"This movie has everything you need in your life: horror, stabbing, Hollywood clichés and a curly demon."
tt7981492,"If you want to laugh, that's the movie for you. If you want to be scared... Sorry, you better find another movie to watch."
tt7981492,"Poor scripting, acting, EVERYTHING!
Filipino cheap horror film is way better than this crap!"
tt7981492,"Started out OK progressed down hill. Nothing original here. Something to pass the time better would have been a book, on anything!! Don't waste your time on this movie. Donald Duck is more entertaining."
tt7895904,"So far, Blumhouse Films has done no wrong in my eyes. You can pretty much cover your eyes, point your finger to any one of their titles, and still come up a winner. ""Family Blood,"" unfortunately, wasn't one of those.Yes, it's a vampire story. And, yes, there were variations to that mythos on display here. But that couldn't make up for the fact that the movie was a long, slow-burning chore with characters you don't really care about. At least the filmmakers didn't throw the whole AA/NA concept down your throat...that much."
tt7895904,I loved the premise and unique spin to a vampire movie but it jumped all over the place and was just made poorly. I hope someone tried the idea again with better directing.
tt7895904,"Remember Vinessa Shaw? She was the lead female (Excluding the witches) in cult favorite Hocus Pocus (1993). Since then she's done.........and then there was.........and who could forget? Erm, stuff?Here she leads as a former drug addict turned vampire and the affect it has on her and her two children. I can't help but feel like the whole movie was one big metaphor for addiction.There is a problem though and it's a big one. The movie is unforgivably boring, so boring in fact I fell asleep about 1/3 of the way through and had to watch the thing from scratch again the next day.It's SO lifeless, the characters simply aren't likeable and honestly until the last few minutes nothing happens. On top of that I see people claiming this is a new spin on the tired vampire formula, my question is how? How is this a new spin? This has been done before, the whole thing is devoid of originality.Not one for fans of vampire cinema or for that matter cinema period.The Good:.......nopeThe Bad:I actually fell asleep and had to watch it againSo boringLifeless nonsenseThings I Learnt From This Movie:Vinessa Shaw has nothing to contribute to the industryRegular vampires > Twilight Vampires > These vampires"
tt7895904,"Watched this with a couple of friends, the movie was very generic and boring, overdone plot and had forgettable characters, wouldn't recommend this
3/10"
tt7895904,"When it comes to modern Horror, lowered expectations have been serving me quite well for over a decade now. Think about it, it's a lot easier to enjoy a film even when it's mediocre and below if one's expectations are for a mediocre and below viewing experience. It even allows for a few pleasant surprises, when one of these films turn out to be good. In the case of Family Blood, not expecting a masterpiece (and not getting one) has made it so I actually enjoyed it, albeit to a limited extent.Considering this title doesn't currently have a synopsis and the limited summary gives very little details - I consider most details (even those one finds out in the first 30 minutes) as spoilers and will refrain from mentioning them. Suffice it to say that the best part about Family Blood, in my opinion, is the portraying of protagonist Ellie's attempts to cope with her addictions, both her original one and her new one. The acting is also great, especially by the younger cast, i.e. Ellie's children Kyle and Amy who are forced to see their mother spiraling out of control.Both IMDB and Netflix have this title tagged as Horror as well as Thriller, which in my opinion is utterly misleading and almost deceptive. Three or four Horror scenes and a plot revolving around a single element usually considered a Horror component do not make a Horror film. Family Blood is a good enough Drama and quite suspenseful at times, but it is far from being actually scary in any way. As an addict myself (clean and sober, going on seven years, yay me) I got some added emotional value out of watching this, but I doubt most people would find this title to be more than average, at best.In summary, Family Blood is not unwatchable and could even be quite enjoyable, with lowered expectations. It's one of these films available on Netflix which are suspenseful enough to enjoy and not enough scary or horrific to ruin a good meal or snack. Not really recommended, not really not recommended, just average. You might enjoy it, you might not."
tt7895904,"This is one of the most terrible movies i have ever seen in my life, poor story telling in a very slow tempo. Really don't waste your time, you have been warned!"
tt7895904,"An attempt on a very over done plot. This was boring, slow, pointless and very disappointing considering its a BH movie. Not worth the time."
tt7895904,"Different from what you might be used to but with that comes intrigue. Only complaint is that despite the slow process, character development was kind of a miss, as well as certain aspects of the movie where they had a chance to totally invent itself since it was a pretty original idea. Instead they fell back on tired ideas. When it comes to casting not to bad pretty good fits except for a role that really wasn't too important. Ajiino Alexus did a fine job but doesn't pass for a high school kid, which falls on the casting director. If you have time give it a watch."
tt7895904,"Decently cast & acting,was overall ok.
Cinematography felt amateur,editing was poor.
Bad weather? Need something to watch? Check it out."
tt7895904,"I always like a good scary movie, but this one isn't scary or good. Absolutely NOTHING happens the first 30 minutes, and it gets worse from there. The only cast member i was familiar with was James Ransome, who starred in 'Ken Park'...and I can still see his famous scene from that movie in my mind's eye, and believe me, it was 100 times scarier than his role here (Google it). I have no idea where Netflix finds these turkeys. It seems for every decent flick, there are ten that should never have seen the light of day, and I'm being generous. Don't waste your time."
tt7895904,Interesting Twist on the genre. Combination of horror and drama which I love.
tt7895904,"I just watched Family Blood on Netflix, knowing that it hadn't been favorably reviewed so my expectations were lowered. I'm still a bit surprised by the low rating on here (currently a 4.3), the film has a lot going for it, but also has it's share of issues. 
First off, the production values on this one are excellent, especially assuming this was likely a lower budgeted film. But a great looking and sound film does not make a film great. The story is pretty interesting, if nothing totally new. A mother of two teenagers who is trying to overcome a drug addiction becomes a vampire (via another vampire) and then begins to deal with her new addiction to blood. The blood addiction being compared to drugs is very heavy handed, but that's where this one redeems itself a bit. It focuses more on drama than horror, and so if you're looking for straight up horror this one is not for you, however if you like some drama in the mix, you might want to give it a shot. I enjoyed the slow pace, as I mentioned before, my expectations were that it was heavily focused on drama and so I didn't feel disappointed in the lack of horror on screen.
However there are numerous unnecessary ""jump"" scares (that didn't make me jump) where they are just too forced. 
Also how many times are people going to call out a character's name? Holy! Half the dialogue in this was just saying the a name of a character, often multiple times over.
The biggest issue to me though was the editing. I don't mean every cut, but most scene transitions were handled clumsily. It seemed like they needed to fill a gap in between scenes and transitions were awkward. Characters felt like they just appeared and disappeared as the the filmmakers needed at any moment during a scene. They'd wander down a hallway for no real reason and then they'd be somewhere else entirely a couple of shots later. It was strange. Overall the story is decent, if maybe sometimes a bit slow, and it gets bogged down by some odd editing choices. The actors do a commendable job, and the cinematography is great. If you're looking for horror then skip it, if you are looking for something more about the drama with horror elements then it might be worth a shot."
tt7895904,"This movie was a slow burn kind of, but it is really smart, and I thought a unique take on the type of movie it is. 5/10 would rewatch this with a friend."
tt7895904,I gave this movie a go after reading reviews really wish I hadn't bothered nuff said
tt7895904,"Family Blood is such a curious film, on paper it sounded like something I'd have really enjoyed. Unfortunately I didn't, I normally like slow, engaging horror films, I can cope with an ambling pace, but this takes it to extremes, I was bored from start to finish, so much so I had to spool through parts. The acting was decent, but the editing and production really does let it down. At times it felt more like melodrama then horror, this odd blurring between genres may suit some, but I just felt bored, there was something about the feel of the movie I just didn't like, maybe it was the story itself.I can't really find many positive things to say sadly. 3/10"
tt7895904,Well this movie was so boring. I believe it was one of the most boring films that I've ever seen. I felt so tired after watching it which didn't happen any time before. God don't let create such bad as this one any more.
tt7895904,"I do not recommend this movie unless you're a vampire enthusiast, otherwise its a big nono.
3 stars is just for the actors."
tt7895904,"One of the worst out there. Boring, dull, lacking , overdone and a waste of time."
tt7895904,"Had no idea what this was, however ,I was Totally surprised. It has to do with a real addiction and one that is an even more deadly kind, VAMPIRISM. It is a slowly paced film with a great lead up to the dread. That performances are all top notch, especially the young son. He has watched his mother go from a drug addiction too often to get help with a to no avail. His disappointment watching his mother slip back to her habit only this time out it is one that he would never imagine.I also must mention the sound. I had to mute the sound at least three time thinking there was something coming from somewhere other than the film. It was very creepy to say the least. I will watch this again, it was that good. I think a lot of the negative comments are due to the fact that there was very little blood. There really did not need to be."
tt7895904,"I liked the story line. I liked the slow and steady pace. I really enjoy movies with those qualities. I also love that it's not a volume roller coaster. You know, louder than hell and then suddenly the actors are whispering and then loud again and back and forth. I hate riding the volume buttons on my remote as I'm watching a movie. What I didn't like is how dark it was. I love a dark themed movie but I can't stand when I can't see everything on the screen. I know that may not make sense to a lot of people but there's a difference between a dark movie and a poorly lit movie. But that's just me. My two cents."
tt7895904,"Plot: fine, cool. Basic vampire movie. Nothing new, but not terrible.It was the characters I had a problem with. Every single one was so flat and boring. You couldn't make any emotional connection with them. Then there was this constant flip flop of emotions towards other characters.The scares were minimal and basic.Honestly, don't waste your time on this one. It was a bore rather than a b movie."
tt7895904,"The premise is good, but this movie takes a long time to go nowhere. I fast forwarded and it was still too slow. Just people looking at each other in judgement after they do something awkward or weird happens. It is more of a sad drama than a horror movie."
tt10397734,"Sometimes you have to endulge or at least overlook flaws to enjoy a movie. When it is one, that is supposed to be clever and keep us guessing to where it goes (with twists and so forth), you may be more easily annoyed if it isn't coherent though, which makes perfect sense (in contrast to the movie and how certain characters act and react).Give it a break or not. It will be a deciding factor on how you'll view the movie overall. I've seen worse but also far better movies"
tt10397734,"One of the worst Nigerian movies I have watched in a while. Cliche storyline, poor transition, low budget movie. I was really disappointed. However, I tried to see the movie through in view of a plotwist, but I stopped watching about 15 minutes to the end as I felt my time had been wasted enough. The only positive was the picture quality."
tt10397734,A nice concept that was poorly executed. Unnecessary flashbacks made it seem like you were watching the movie twice. The first 30minutes had poor audio making the actors sound adlibbed and the overly dark theme hid the expressions of the actors.
tt10397734,"The plot twist is wowing. Coming from Nollywood, this is an idea portrayed beautifully. Niyi did a wonderful job. Respect that."
tt10397734,I enjoyed it. It was brilliant coming from the stables of Hollywood movies. Not a wasted time spent
tt10397734,"The main reason for me watching this film was Adesua Etomi-Wellington, I've watched a few of her movies and have enjoyed them, she is (IMO) very beautiful, and a good actress, so I hoping for another enjoyable film featuring her, this movie didn't deliver on that premise, flashback after flashback, left the movie very disjointed, and gave no reason to care for any particular character, looking at Adesua was the only reason I hung around, however big UP to Netflix for featuring International films, there are really good Nigerian films to watch."
tt10397734,"If you are Nigerian, then you will understand that this movie is not a cliché, the plot twist was fantastic. This movie moved from the usual Nigerian romcom and focused on suspense which was thrilling to watch and had me glued to the screen from beginning to the end! Well done to the actors, a great job, indeed!"
tt10397734,Actually I thought it was quite clever mystery. There were a few holes in the storyline but it wasnt that bad for a movie from that part of the world. I was gripped from the get go.
tt10397734,"I never write reviews about movies i watch, but i had to for this one. It was beautifully directed. Nollywood is coming up🔥big time. The real definition of a set up, with mind blowing twist and turns."
tt10397734,This movie was interesting from start to finsh. The acting was world class.
tt10397734,Creative storyline with talented actors. A bit excessive with some of the flashbacks but still very interesting throughout.
tt10397734,"You have to watch it for yourself and enjoy the different and exciting plot twists. This is a movie that seats you down to connect the dots. Excellent Actors!! World-class Nollywood! If you're like me, watch with subtitle, it's sweeter."
tt13452100,"If this is number 9 on Netflix, I'm going back to Prime video."
tt13452100,"One question- who are these people? Most of them are neither rich nor famous. I would love to watch fabulous lives of people WHO MATTER, but I'm sure they won't let Netflix peek into their private lives for a few bucks.
Karan Johar probably made this series to help these poor people earn some money for the first time in a long time."
tt13452100,"This is outright disgusting to the core. Who are these people? This is all sham, show-off and buffoonery. They can't even point out on map where is Paris, and what's with all fake accents. Padhe likhe ganwaars. Bollywood is not about such fake creeps, these @$$hol*s should rightfully be banned from everywhere"
tt13452100,Pathetic ..don't even want to write any review for this.. disgusting...brainless karan johar..why Netflix is publishing his content ..oh God..horrible...better avoid..sadak 2 is better than this...
tt13452100,"I'm not sorry to say that this show is so rubbish. The women are trying to act like western Teenagers. I have only seen the first episode and I can truly say how very disappointing it was. You may have wealth but the reflection of these women are far from that. They are acting like Wannabees for no reason from the hideous ""designer"" outfits to trying to be like the Kardashians. When will India come up with something original? Show us wives that love Indian food, love dressing in Indian attire, proudly show off the Indian culture ... Just expected something different."
tt13452100,TBH they actually revealed their totally lack lustre lives. And No amount of injections or attempts at cobbing fake accents can take away how miserable they are . Obvious disconnect with Kids and failed marriages .money soaked in under handed dealsWhy doesn't NETFLIX use their professional jurisdiction and Sift out this useless OTT content
tt13452100,Super IRRITATING....All super fake. Karan Johar has no content so just try to glorify Bollywood. There should be an option of negative rating which hands down goes to this show
tt13452100,I thought there were brown people in India. As a brown girl with indian heritage...where are the BROWN people of India??????
tt13452100,"Wonderful web series, finished it fastest. So glamorous and stylish. Everyone was awesome. Besides Maheep, Seema, Neelam and Bhavana, I loved Ananya, Shanaya and Gauri Khan too. Can't get over it. Looking forward for Season 2."
tt13452100,"As movies are fake, this show / series show how fake the people are and their families. Its a show about some Bollywood celebrities spouses with fake life style to fake accents to fake living.
All the main lead spouses never had good screen presences and not very successful with their movies. This show, backed by Karan Johar which i have no idea what was he trying to achieve is a ridiculous attempt copying other reality shows. All four claims to be best of friends for many years and in the show contradicting their own statements by being surprised to everything that happens, showing in reality they are meeting for the very first time.
A complete waste of time and nothing more."
tt13452100,"I was expecting awful fights, drama and the usual gossip that comes with the ""wives of"" series and other reality shows. This one pleasantly depicts long lasting friendships and make you envious of their inner circle! Love their dynamic, and I think it's what made me come back to the episodes (not so much the fashion or anything else). Also love little glimpses into rest of their families.Karan perhaps tries a little too hard with the QA sessions vs something a little more free flowing but the ladies are top notch - Maheep, Bhavana, and Seema that is.Neelam- is she really like that? God what a bore. Such a sheltered grown ass baby. The woman version of a ""man child"". She really comes off like she has done no personal development since she was 15 and started in the industry. Very vanilla and stuck in the 80s. She's only got her looks going for her. Thank goodness she addressed her accent early on, cause even that was cringe.Can't wait for season 3!"
tt13452100,"I can feel why the show would feel pretentious and the mannerisms lethargic, but it's because we the middle class have not walked in their shoes and the way they talk can be attributed to the people they interact with on a daily basis , we all live in our own bubble and our social interactions are a reflection of that . I felt like the people in the show at their core were normal people who have their own insecurities and struggles , happy and sad days , have their own set of goals and aspirations , just because it don't match the way we look at life doesn't warrant the hate we are sprewing ,guys wealth alone can't make a person happy,abt the whole nepotism debate a parent who is successful at his/her profession be it at any field will only encourage their children to get into it the same right, agreed this will mean the real talented and hardworking people will lose their place in such a flawed system , but we do know bollywood is just another money making business and very few have the magnanimity to recognise talents and take risks on them , our institutions are never know to promote talent , coming back to the show this is definitely not the greatest out there and certainly not the worst , I skipped through most of it as it as a lot of it was not relatable to me , but the general gist of it didn't make me want to throw up or troll them as I came here expecting to see rich people showboating but I was surprised to see much more in it ."
tt13452100,"Please stay away. Cringefest, fake accents, why Karan johar why?"
tt13452100,Honestly couldnot watch after 15 mins. It's horrendous n the fake accents. Please kjo stay away from Netflix hi
tt13452100,"Here comes stories of more worthless wanna bees of that dump called Bollywood. Makers of this show should be asked to clean toilets for years. These had been ugly souled women sold
Their souls to the lowest bidder, can see in their faces."
tt13452100,"I was appalled when I watched this show with the family and could not believe what I was hearing. Wannabe celebrities thinking that four letter swear words are cool and a mark of well to do people - well I'm sorry to say it is not!!
And these are mothers !!!"
tt13452100,"If show is being targetted for Indian audience, it should have been in hindi instead of fake English accent.
If show is targetted for NRIs, I think NRIs have much better content to watch on Netflix.
Its a low budget copy of Kardashians show."
tt13452100,I am going to sue Netflix for the mental harassment caused by this show.No wonder starkids turns out to be arrogant and stupid when they are raised by parents like these..Save yourselves from this pandemic
tt13452100,"It's beautifully directed, a really out of the box idea and extremely professionally executed. Class written all over it.Well educated, fab English speaking Bollywood families, raising their kids in the perfect manner.There's tonnes to learn from this and appreciate. I want to congratulate the whole team for creating a ""worth every minute"" kind of programme.We live in the UK and we enjoyed it very much.Unfortunately, in the same breath I can understand how the masses may not appreciate it. It needs a certain class to appreciate it.Thanks again guys, and good luck for the future ones."
tt13452100,"The name should should not be 'Fabulous Lives oF Bollywood' to 'Fake lives of Bunch of unsuccessful people'They are not even close to Bollywood. Who are these ppl. Public don't even know these ladies 🤣🤣😂Anyways and sorry to add Neelam was never and good actress and she did not have any career on Bollywood and acting 😜.
This is all about promoting there Brands as ppl don't know them.
The total Bakwaas it was."
tt13452100,"I watched the series and honestly felt the need to write about it. I have seen some reality shows of the US. The housewives of Beverly Hills etc. They try to show friendship but its always cold. This show somehow gives you warmth. If you compare it to Hollywood based reality shows, this is way better. As a mother who is working I felt good that these women being a mother and wives are also having fun"
tt13452100,"If you have three-four hours of no work and outside world seems boring, you can choose to see this. It is a Indian Masala Sex & the city. There is nothing so fabulous about their live that you will want to watch, but this series may feel like a guilty pleasure for many. I have no complaints wasting my time to this. You can also finish some boring office work watching this, you can easily divert your attention without losing any bit of this series (it isn't that tough to catch up)."
tt13452100,"Fake accent, fake Color, fake soul.. this is Bollywood at its sh(itti)est
Ban this"
tt13452100,When I see karan JOHAR ..I couldn't bear his face.. Sushant's Father..Sister..all comes in front of me..and my heart goes with them.. when i saw my young son little bullied..then it scares me..how this MAN destroy someone's life ....i promise to my GOD..that i won't see his any movie untill sushant would get justice..
tt7967882,"Rainbow Bright and Captain Planet had a baby. Luckily she's pretty because there's not much else going on here.If you skip the opening credits, you'll still hear the full song at least twice per episode. The voices are worse than Paw Patrol, and the story telling falls way short. The show has a unicorn that only says it's name, a la Groot, but it's not endearing.I'm not sure how we are supposed to know who these characters are, or where they're from, or what connection they have with Earth since they live on fake Asgard.Also, stop trying to make 'Splendiferous' happen. It's not going to happen!."
tt7967882,Preston Praxton just tricked the rainbow rangers into some kind of pod then pushed it off his boat to the bottom of the ocean. When they figured their way out and resurfaced they offered him an idea to make him even richer! WHAT?!!
tt7967882,"The show could have potential but because of glaring one sided political agendas makes this show worst than captain planet and less entertaining. I dont mind helping the environment but using propaganda to kids shouldn't be it.The show is several ""rangers"" with different powers that help the environment. This show has some episodes that the rangers will save an animal from a storm or reunit a family of hedgehogs but then you have the villain episodes which instead of teaching how to use, repair or replant the environment is alway humans are greedy and bad and messing up environment is bad; just like captain planet. The all girl team's villain are mostly Male. I rather my child to learn equality regardless of race or gender not girls dominate boys.The actual characters are lack luster. They only do a few things and floof the rainbow unicorn thing seems to be the swiss army knife of anything they need. Most of the voice actors are monotone and have little to no reflection in their voices and most have annoying voices. This makes boring characters more uninteresting.Last is the child test. Does my 2 year old daughter like it? She turns the tv off anytime the show comes on. Thats pretty bad since she enjoys every other nick jr show. This show is not entertaining at all."
tt7967882,"Manure of the most putrid kind.For all parents subjected this, may god have mercy on your souls."
tt7967882,My kids love this show and all the kids in school love it as well.
tt7967882,A Captain Planet message for younger kids! Mine loves it and she's 3.
tt7967882,"The nieces are obsessed and oddly my younger nephew too 😂 The song is catchy, the episodes are short for their attention span and there are some nature and animal facts sprinkled in for food measure. Better than a lot of the other things they make me watch with them 🤣"
tt7967882,"All the kids seem to love the show. The adults, no so much. Anyway, it's nice to have more kids shows on Netflix."
tt7967882,My kids love watching it! It helps them understand how we are hurting our planet and the animals we share it with. It's a show all kids should be watching!
tt7967882,My 2yo and I aren't really fans of show perse but she plays the intro at least 3x a day for about 6 months now. We tried to watch the show a few times meh. I would've gave it a 4 rating but went wit 10 stars bcuz of catchy song n my daughter sounds so cute singing it!
tt7967882,Amazingly done. My daughter can't stop laughing and watching. Wish it will continue.
tt7967882,My daughter loves this show. Also has a great message about ways to care for and protect our environment.
tt7967882,"This cartoon isn't meant for me so for me to review it is pointless. On behalf of my 4 year old I am giving it a 10. She loves it and that is all you need to know. We have spent a good few hours playing Rainbow Rangers where I have to be the bad guy and do evil plans and boobytraps. It has been great fun and she has learnt a thing or two along the way as well. I hope it brings happiness to more young children. It's standard formulaic kid's television. The Rangers are playing, something in the world is wrong, they get called to action, 3 of them are arbitrarily picked to solve it, they find out the same bad guy is to blame, they solve it, the end."
tt7967882,"Shes already asking for outfits and toys, very educational , and she loves it cant wait for more"
tt7967882,Rainbow Rangers is a show that teaches children about the environment. My children love it.
tt7967882,Great show for kids. My girls love it. It's also informative and educational. Shows right from wrong.
tt7967882,"They are so cute, my nieces LOVE them. Love the colors and and action."
tt7967882,Kids like it. something that's age appropriate and they enjoy
tt7967882,Is it entertaining my infant? Yes. Is it captain planet meets care bears? Certainly. Will my kid want all the eventual figures? Probably. Will I buy them? Arguably.
tt7967882,"Maybe I should let them write the review haha. They love it, though. Their first real obsession. They love the characters and - a lot like the Dora Explorer's and Blue's Clues, of past - Rainbow Rangers is healthy and very helpful in helping young minds begin to understand the world. I want my babies to learn as much information as they can to make solid, well-rounded decisions. I know that myself, my wife, their educators, and peers will teach them a lot; however, media will be a huge influence over them, like it or not. With that being said, Rainbow Rangers is a hit.Also, check out Llama Llama on Netflix, another massive hit in our household."
tt7967882,My son and daughter can watch this show for hours.
tt7967882,"It's like someone tried to put together Captain Planet, the Paw Patrol, Rainbow Bright, and just a hint of Pokémon with the purpose of selling toys.The villains are even more one dimensional than the Captain Planet villains with the twist of sometimes not being irredeemable. The format of an episode is nearly a carbon copy of Paw Patrol (complete with ""Kalia needs us!"") but with even worse plot lines. The entire rainbow aesthetic feels recycled, and the Floof character is like something from the Pokémon cutting room floor.From a structural point of view, the selection of characters for the plot often feels unmatched to the conflict (like not brining Anna on missions involving animals). The abilities of some of the characters don't feel thought out either.When looking for more information on the show, supposedly the character of BB is supposed to be autistic but she just comes off as aping the worst of 80s 'brainy' characters rather than the stated intention.While the goal of teaching environmental awareness is admirable, it would be better if there had been some attempt to more accurately portray the issues and possible solutions (or even admit that more work needs to be done in some areas).Overall, the show feels like the kind of cash grab it's main villain Preston would try."
tt7967882,We are very particular with what we let our kids watch and this is one of the few shows we let them watch. I love the fact it has a strong environmental theme as this is part of our lifestyle. It is a kids cartoon though and it is entertaining enough to keep my kids still for 20 minutes.
tt7967882,Who names a unicorn floof I'm offended there is only one floof and that's POOMIN 🐶 !!!
tt0422774,"I mean when I saw Are We There Yet, I thought it was finished from there but no. They had to do Are We Done Yet. I mean, if they know the first one was bad why are they making another one, what is wrong with these directors. They are making some bad squeals or remakes that are in the bottom and they still continue. Soon another one is going to be called Are We Having Fun Yet, well guess what, no. And for sure this movie would at least be better than the first, but it is worst. I should be stupid for watching this piece of crap. Let me tell you for all that didn't see this movie yet, you made the right choice. Soon, these dopes will make the third, then the fourth, then more. Make sure you will never see this, the only funny jokes are in the trailer. That's it."
tt0422774,"I've never seen Are We There Yet?, and I had no intention of watching this film. I thought as many that the funny parts were in the trailers and that the actors were sub-par. For the most part that is true. There were some surprises in the humor, mostly from John C. McGinley, but it was far from side splitting. Even though it was not a great movie on the whole, it was a great family film. Today, with the exception of Disney, most movies are far from family friendly. Even Dreamwork's cartoons have a great deal of crude humor in them that make most parents cringe when watching them with small children. Are We Done Yet? actually has a lot of great family values that are missing from a lot of movies that have come out recently. The film shows a man who is forced to take care of a family that is not his own and also to prepare for his future children with his new wife. This step-father acts more like a dad should to his teenage step-daughter than most real father's do. Very rarely will you see some one in a film telling a young girl to put on more clothes and yelling at her for sneaking out of the house. If you are looking for something that is more than okay to watch with the kids then this is a movie to check out. Don't expect anything close to award winning, but parents can watch this safely with their kids without wondering if their kids know what the last innuendo meant every couple of minutes."
tt0422774,"I hope they are done and this is the last sequel to this franchise. This time Nick is moving his family to the suburbs. They get duped into buying a house that is falling apart and then hire an extremely eccentric contractor to fix it up. And as you would expect in movies like this, mishaps follow. There is a raccoon on the roof that won't go away, bats come through the chimney, the whole floor gets torn up, etc...But Nick comes around and takes Kevin fishing, in what is perhaps the silliest part of the film with the cgi giant catfish. But Chuck the contractor is extremely annoying and I can't believe even the wife would think he is great after he sells them a torn up house and tears it up himself fixing it. But since this is a kids film, you know Nick will learn the value of family in the end.FINAL VERDICT: It's for kids. 10 year olds will probably like it."
tt0422774,"Holy crap, I hope so, because I can't stand to watch another one of these horrible films. Let me start off with my grisly story of how I watched this film. I got it as a Christmas present from a family member. She said I knew I liked the first one, which she was wrong, so she went ahead and got me the sequel. I made a fake smile, and before I put it away for life, she suggested we watched it. My heart was pounding out of my chest, for I knew I could not escape! I hated the first one and even though I am willing to give any film a chance, I was not anywhere near excited.Well, we started it up, and pretty soon we were all sitting down watching it. Here's a clue as to what my families thoughts on it were: The family member apologized for buying it for me, my brother fell asleep, and my mom sat there with a disgusted look on her face. Even my eight year old cousin and five year old nephew did not laugh! I still can not believe that this is the filth that caused the wonderful movie Grindhouse to bomb, and I will hate this film until the very day I die for that, and I feel tremendously sorry for anyone who decides to watch it. It's just as poor as everything is in the first. Lame jokes, lame acting and lame plot.If another film is made I assume it will be titled, ""We're Not Done Yet, Sorry""."
tt0422774,"It's not funny at all, it's got a story stringed together, and the acting isn't even all that good.It's just bad, watch something else."
tt0422774,"I can't understand why this movie would make the bottom 100 movies on IMDb at #11. There have been far worse movies than this. I question a lot of time on how people rate movies on this website. This the kind of movie that isn't expected to have a great plot! It's family movie that should be a fun outing and it sure looks like it would be to me and I'm 19 yrs. old! I enjoyed the first movie and I wanted to see the second one but never got the chance to. i'll definitely be seeing it when it comes out on DVD. It's mindless fun that you can turn your brain off and enjoy. Night at the Museum didn't have a fabulous plot line but if you turned off your brain, it was an enjoyable movie. People, just give movies like this a chance and have fun! I think a lot of people don't understand whatt family fun means anymore...I'm looking forward to enjoying it :)"
tt0422774,"I admit, I didn't see this film in the theater. I caught the first one (Are We There Yet) on cable and disliked it enough that I refused to see the sequel. However, flipping through the channels one day, I caught a couple of scenes of ""Are We Done Yet"" and frankly, I found myself laughing more than once. It was surprisingly enjoyable. John McGinley was brilliant, Ice Cube made me chuckle every time something went wrong. He was so likable even when he was the most frustrated. It was a lighthearted family film, that given the chance, rendered some bonafide giggles. This movie didn't deserve a 2.8. I'd easily give it a 6."
tt0422774,"We had free passes that were coming up for their date of use so we took a stroll to the theater to watch a family ""G"" rated movie. Unfortunately, it was the only one available (sadly, Shrek III was opening the next day...) so we went for it.You know what, i was expecting a awful movie but i ended up finding it to be fair. But in a family perspective. The acting for the young and adult actors is way under the average and the characters are so naive, sometimes it hurts !5/10 for its family values, the scene with the owl (which i found the funniest) but the lack of continuous laughter.Again, to be enjoyed with the company of for 6 to 10 year old kids."
tt0422774,"I don't know why so many other people hate this movie so much. Some of them said outright that they didn't like the first one, so why would they watch the sequel? I enjoyed the first one, so naturally I wanted to see the sequel. Sure, it was a bit hokey, but a lot of family movies are. This movie was funny, and it had some serious moments too.If you haven't seen this movie yet, here's my recommendation: a. If you didn't like the first movie, you probably won't like this one either, so don't waste your time watching it and then complain about it on this website.b. If you liked the first movie, you'll probably enjoy this one as well, so go ahead and enjoy it, no matter what the complainers say.c. If you haven't seen the first movie, watch it first, because it's a good movie and gives you the background on the story. Then watch this movie."
tt0422774,"I'll be the first to admit that 'Are We There Yet?' is pretty atrocious. In fact, thinking about it, I have to wonder why I even wanted to see 'Are We Done Yet?' when its predecessor was so awful.To my surprise, this turned out to be one of the most entertaining family movies I have seen in a long time. Admitedly, I don't go and see too many, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun this movie was. I find it incredible that this film is, as of this writing, number 29 in the list of worst films ever on IMDb. That said, 'V for Vendetta' (one of the worst films ever made, in my opinion) is in the top 250, so what does it really mean? What astounds me is that 'Are We There Yet?' is better rated than its sequel, which outdoes it in almost every way. Don't get me wrong, this is not Tarkovsky. It's stupid and childish and essentially pointless, but guess what - that's the point, it's a family film. Taken in this context, it is a more than passable way to spend 100 minutes of your time.Ice Cube, who looked and felt a little out of place in the first film, has eased into this character nicely and has really developed some fine comic timing. To be able to go from ""the nigga you love to hate"" to a genuinely amusing turn in a family comedy is not something many people could do with any degree of success, but Cube pulls it off.The kids are less annoying than they were in the first film, but the writers have again failed to give the audience any reason to like them, even a little. Consequently, the most unfeasible thing about Cube's character is that he hasn't murdered them yet. What the writers have managed to do here is give Nia Long a bit more to work with. In 'Are We There Yet?' it was hard to imagine what Cube's character saw in her (aside from the obvious) but she's actually a lot more endearing here, and she looks divine.The real surprise was John C McGinley, whom I expected to suck royally. While he's not known for comedy and has made some ropey choices over the years (notable exceptions being 'Platoon', 'Point Break' and 'Seven'), he almost makes this film. His character is ridiculous, and the biggest mistake he and the director could have made would have been to try and ground the character in any sort of reality. Thankfully they didn't, and McGinley consequently provides some of the best moments in the movie. The twist in the character's back story actually manages to be quite moving too.All things considered, its hard to fault a film that is under no pretence about its intentions. This is nothing more or less than good family fun. The fact that it is also well paced, well designed and has fantastic music supervision only adds to my admiration.If you go to see this film for the right reason, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised (I urge you not to be put off by its predecessor). If you go into it looking for a reason to bad-mouth it, I have one thing to say to you; Get a life, it's a frigging family film!"
tt0422774,"Of all the Ice Cube movies I have seen, this has got to be the worst. Not only were many of results cliché, especially the ending, but many of the characters were just unfunny. And that is being nice.John McGinley, who initially seems welcoming, becomes a nuisance. He sells Ice a lemon of a home and has a monopoly on every main job for the community. But instead of getting rid of him, he becomes liked. Even Ice Cube likes him at the end.Many of the jokes were bad or badly set up. I admit blind plumbers could have been funny. But instead, they just walked about with stereotypical blind sticks. But nothing funny happened. Nothing. How could anybody blow a bit like that? Apparently this crew could.Ice Cube could have done worse. But I am not happy with his work. Nia Long is very nice looking, but the plot, direction, and screenplay is all wrong. Better luck making ""Next Next Friday"" or ""Barbershop 3"". They probably would be better. ""D"""
tt0422774,"It was amazing, that such crap could be made and anyone could give it higher than a 1!The entire movie, it seems like ice cubes only line is I can fix that! The entire movie i felt like saying are we done yet? I was NEVER entertained and didn't laugh ONCE! When i went there with some friends, private movie, second day. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? Absolute crap. A torn down house and a man is trying to sell it. nothing interesting. So boring in fact, halfway through the movie i went to a corner and played with Ribiks cube. We left 30 minates before it was over, and went bowling instead. Do not buy this on DVD! (unless your suisideal.)Deserves the bottom spot in the bottom 100."
tt0422774,"This film focuses this time on Ice Cube and John C. McGinley as the main leads of the film.Yes, the other cast do star, however these are the central characters.John C. McGinley is the annoying character in the film seen as evil by Ice Cube and lovely and adorable by the other cast.NOW you can see thats going to cause problems when your stepfather and your wife's going to have twins. Not only that you have bought the ultimate house of horrors, which reminds me of Tom Hanks's movie MONEY PIT.I really like John C. McGinley as an actor but he annoyed me. Ice cube has made a movie for moral value and good attempt at a family comedy. It does not live up to the original as the movie is now shared by two stars and the movie does begin to slow down. For attempt and some good sequences 5.Notice Taj Mowhry in this film, yeah he looks different but not that much that I could not recognise him."
tt0422774,"The film takes place about a year after the events from Are We There Yet(2005), and Nick(Ice Cube) and Suzanne(Nia Long) get married and live in his apartment with the kids, and sells his store in hopes to becomes a magazine writer. But Suzanne announces that she is pregnant, and Nick soon realizes that his apartment is no place for a family, so they move, much of the dismay of the kids, out to the beautiful side of the country. They end up buying a house, but the house is very old, and it begins to fall apart(anybody remember The Money Pit?). So they call on Chuck Mitchell Jr(John C. McGinley), a contractor who in hopes to help fix up the place, and that Murphy's Law does not take part. I enjoyed Are We There Yet, but the second time around just didn't quite do it. Although moments with Ice Cube and John C. McGinley playing off each other were pretty funny, but the rest of the film to me, appeared to be that was trying to hard to be funnier then the first, but it just didn't do it. It ends up looking like one Bad SNL joke after another."
tt0422774,"terrible movie! Weird camera work, script parts stolen from other movies, very bad acting, predictable slapstick jokes, etc etc etc O.k. it's a family movie, but thats no reason it shouldn't be good? This movie uses every cliché there is but really fails in doing it good.I kinda liked the first one, it wasn't very good but I laughed sometimes, but this one is really awful, it only brought a smile to my face once (powerwalking part).The maniac contractor is wrecking the entire house but everybody is loving this annoying guy!?!?! Very very very bad movie, skip this one pls! ."
tt0422774,"Ice Cubes career maybe done with another movie like this, poor sequel to ARe We There Yet? Done is a remake of Mr Blandings Builds His Dream House. The earlier film had Cary Grant and some very good jokes coming from the pain of renovating an old home. Done is full of stupid jokes (some of which are funny-but not enough) stupid characters and poor direction and writing.Who did they make this movie for? As much as I disliked the kids in the first film (the reason I disliked that movie) there was something that made it work if you could get past the brats.This is just poor wishful thinking The best thing to do when asked ""Are We Done Yet? is simply not to start"
tt0422774,"I thought it was really funny. Me, my brother and my sister-in-law watched this, i personally thought it was very good. Not as good as the first one though. I thought one of the funny parts (that stuck with me) was when there was a possum on his roof and he was trying to get it off, and it so funny because the possum just stairs at him after he falls through his house's roof ... his face is price-less :)I have given it a 7/10 basing on its humour and very funny story lines.i recommend it to anyone who found the first one funny - or wants a laugh!"
tt0422774,"so finally I'm writing my first review because i think something is wrong here i have just watched this movie with my 7 years old boy and guess what? we both enjoyed it, in fact ,i watched it twice ! its fun, fresh, and no sex scenes or swearing ! so its definitely a family movie so why those HATERS underrated this movie and overrated movies like ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" o and some of my favourite films are : 12 angry men,the rear window , all spaghetti movies collection,the machinist, godfather 2, and many more , and now ""ARE WE DONE YET "" is one of them , remember cinema is also about entertainment , a good picture, and a laugh, so i will give this movie 8"
tt0422774,Everyone is picking on this wonderful family friendly movie....well worth the watch especially if you has young kids in the house.The story is fun and the charators are many...its all in good enough...its not the best movie but it deserves at least a rating of 5...Ratings of 1s or 2s are dumb...To everyone else writing bad mean reviews...you are not a real movie critic..GET OVER YOURSELVES!
tt0422774,"I wasn't amused by the first film ""Are We There Yet"", I thought that it wasn't funny and I find Ice Cube to be pretty awful in comedic roles. I decided nonetheless to at least say I finished the franchise by reviewing the sequel ""Are We Done Yet"", one of the most repetitive slapstick bull movies I've ever seen that is filled with borrowing jokes and overusing them. Our disgruntled sports fan and stepfather Nick Parsons returns to buy a house that needs some fixing, resulting in simply hilarious slapstick scenarios where tough guy Ice Cube falls down or does something stupid or childish. To make matters worse both for Nick and for the audience, John C. McGinley steps in as Chuck, the small quaint town's real estate agent, inspector, construction worker, etc., also this wacky guru like comedic element that really overuses his bland and frankly embarrassingly dumb personality. The plot is poor, boring for a kids film and unfunny - it also ""borrows"" heavily from the 1986 Tom Hanks' film ""The Money Pit"". The humor is predictable and unfunny, Ice Cube can't do much as a comedic actor, he's just grumpy most of the time. Our previous main characters from the first film, Nick's stepchildren, have little to no importance and are rarely seen to make more time for wacky Chuck. AWDY's main problem is that it's not appealing to kids or adults, it's troubled in every aspect. What a disaster.P.S. Answering to ""bobyvsamos"" comment that says this atrocious film was great, your name is a portmanteau of Bob Saget and John Stamos, go watch ""Full House"" instead of this abomination. Or you're limited to only watch black sitcoms?"
tt1784589,"A very random cast come together to make a Hindi version of Italian Job and end up spoiling it to no end. The script tries to take twists from the original movie for the Indian people who have actually watched ""Italian Job"" to go all 'oooooh' in the theater, but what they didn't know is the audience isn't that stupid to believe all that was shown.Abhishek Bacchan and Neil Nitin Mukesh do a good job, but Sonam Kapoor CANNOT act to save her life, neither is she good looking, what she tries really hard in the movie to be. Bipasha Basu does what she does best.Some of the stuff shown is so unreal that by half way through, you are just sitting in the theater to at least squeeze in little worth of your money. I mean Mukesh's character 'Spider' has this huge mansion with all high tech stuff, but one bloody vehicle barges in and destroys everything right to his bedroom, really people?The only saving grace to the movie was the little good action it had, especially the train heist, other than the movie was just in bad taste after what Abbas-Mustan had provided in 'RACE'"
tt1784589,"Throughout their career since the early 90s, director duo Abbas-Mustan have been making inspired films taking it all from the West, with a fairly good success ratio at the box office. Quite astonishingly they sometimes have even given us better movies than the Originals like their last RACE. But sadly with PLAYERS the story is not the same unexpectedly.Keeping it straight, when they were copying, they were good. But now when for the first time they have gone for An Official Remake of a Hit Cult Movie, they go all wrong with some hugely un-necessary moves ruining a fine exciting script. Abbad-Mustan's PLAYERS is based on two movies, ""The Italian Job"" made in 1969 and its Official Remake made in 2003 with the same name. Now the first one made in 1969 is a fine British film featuring Michael Caine as the leader Charlie, who plans a Big Gold robbery and the film revolves around only one heist in all till the climax. The main highlights of the film included the massive traffic jam plan and 3 mini coopers (small cars) chase sequence towards its end. Along with that it had an open climax with a surprise. The second Italian JOB got released in 2003 with some brilliant, well written additions in the same plot, introducing a traitor in the team with a second heist plan too executed perfectly. This updated version of the classic excelled its original with a great script, featuring two exciting robberies in just 111 minutes. Now coming to the third Official Indian Remake of the same called PLAYERS, it fails to leave you satisfied due to its own faulty and un- required insertions. This time Abbas-Mustan go legal and take the rights of making the film in Hindi as it should be done ethically. With a big production house backing them, they make a visually stunning movie with all the glitters of gold shining in the grand foreign locations. But when it comes to script, they mess it up posing as more intelligent than the original writers of both the classics.So, PLAYERS misses the target mainly due to its writers and directors acting over-smart and adding many unwanted elements in the film ruining its original charm and feel. I am still confused that when there is already a Hit, well written script in front of you to follow legally, then what's the need of adding the same rotten plots of love and betrayal to it un-necessarily? Honestly speaking, if you haven't seen the exciting 2003 version of THE Italian JOB, then you may like PLAYERS as a one-time watch. But in case you have already witnessed its better remake then you are sure going to find its Hindi Version strange, bizarre and absurd. In fact the same things which were so exciting, thrilling and highpoints of its Original Remake, seem to be very childish, uninteresting and weird in this Bollywood version of the Classic.For instance, the whole first hour is wasted in just showing the selection of various players. The train robbery sequence, though well shot, is based on very unrealistic and funny assumption where every window in the train is having a virtual film running on it, controlled by our computer man. A national treasure in Russia is robbed with such a convenience and a man wears a mask of a senior officer and enters their security easily (in Russia itself). The Big Golden safe gets opened in just a few seconds by only a drilling machine and a small device. Plus the last scene in a very illogical manner tells you that all the Gold bars have actually been melted and converted into small cars made out of the same Gold. (By the way who thought of this legendary idea?)Moreover, the massive traffic jam in the city, the road blasting sequence and the 3 mini coopers chase scenes in the climax, which were the key feature of its original, simply lose their existence in this over-intelligently made official remake. The directors do make their presence felt in certain portions, especially in the execution of the heist scenes and just before the interval but overall one doesn't feel entertained by them as compared to their last venture RACE. Musically PLAYERS is a big dud delivered by the Hit-machine Pritam, with not even one good song in its entire soundtrack. The film is shot superbly as most of the recent big ventures but I hope the makers start giving the same attention to their script department too.Performance wise it also doesn't give you anything great to write about. Most of them in the cast remain wasted with only a few given more time on the screen showing the imbalance. Abhishek in the lead, remains the same in his style and act as he was in his other popular films such as ""Dhoom"". Bipasha is simply there to show off her body and nothing else. Sonam once again looks over-confident with attitude. Bobby Deol, Omi Vaidya & Sikander Kher do not contribute anything significant in the film and are simply wasted. It seems Bobby just signed this film only due to his decades long relationship with the directors. Neil Nitin Mukesh tries his best but manages to do just fine. Vinod Khanna looks tired and out of form whereas Johny Lever still manages to make you laugh in his few scenes.As for now, I have one suggestion to make. If you are not going to see ""The Italian Job"" (2003 version) in any case, then you may opt for PLAYERS as a one-time watch if you wish. But if you are really interested in watching some quality cinema, then strictly watch its 2003 remake first before opting for PLAYERS. Because Abbas Mustan's PLAYERS is highly capable of ruining your exciting experience of watching the best Italian JOB (2003) till date."
tt1784589,"'Players' which is an official remake of 'The Italian Job', clearly makes a fool out of itself. Though I tried my best to keep myself without comparing it with the original, compare or not, the film is like the kindergarten version of the classic. The acting lacks intensity, particularly from Sonam's end, only Neil Mukesh gets somewhere with his villainous act. The train robbery scene doesn't give any edge-of-the seat moments, making such an improbable task look like cake-walk. There are some insanely foolish humour, pushed inside the film, trying to make a masala-flick. The twists degrades the credibility of the film, making it a joke! The music is awful with laughable lyrics. But the only place where the film scores is with its cinematography, because there are some moments which captures the scene beautifully. Director duo Abbas-Mustan easily did better with Race. In all, if you are looking for some genuine and entertaining action-thrillers then you can comfortably give this a miss."
tt1784589,"'Players' is the official remake of the Hollywood classic 'Italian Job'. The director duo, Abbas-Mustan who are well known for churning out thrillers almost every year fail miserably this time in their attempt to recreate their magic.The movie is quite stylish and the cinematography by Ravi Yadav is mind boggling. But the problem lies in the screenplay. Abbas-Mustan have tried to put too many twists and turns in the plot that at the end you feel tired and want to walk away. I wonder why Abbas-Mustan have tried to tamper with the original source with so many unwanted twists. Why didn't they just simply replicate the story of the original when they had the official license to do so? As far as the movie stays true to the original, it is watchable. Once the typical Bollywood formula of twists and songs and dances pop in the latter half, it simply sucks.As for the performances, Abhishek Bachchan looks like he can't get over his 'Dhoom 2' and 'Game' hangover. His mannerisms and facial expressions are just the same as they had been in the aforementioned flicks. The only best performance definitely comes from Neil Nitin Mukesh. Not only does he look handsome, but his acting can give seasoned actors a run for their money. As Spider, Neil proves once again that he is in his best form after his debut 'Johnny Gaddar' and ' New York'. He proves yet again that good looking actors can act really well too. Bobby Deol is terribly wasted in this film. I wonder what made him choose such a minuscule and insignificant role. He wears a sad expression on his face throughout the movie. Thank god, he's only in it for half an hour. Bipasha Basu is always cast in a negative role in all Abbas-Mustan flicks that she has done so far. 'Players' is no exception. Still, she impresses with her acting with a new level of maturity and proves that she's really getting better with every film. Sonam Kapoor is horrible! That girl can't act to save her life. She sports a glamorous look for the first time but an actress she is not. The worst scene of Sonam in the movie was when she brags about being an ethical hacker. She seems so annoying and cannot emote with her eyes. Her emotions look fake and contrived. Sikander Kher looks bored and ready to walk away any time. Omi Vaidya irritates. Vinod Khanna is wasted. It was a delight to see Johnny Lever after such a long hiatus. He's the only one who provides relief with his comic timing in the horribly boring second half.The length of the movie is also a minus point. The first half moves at a brisk pace once all the characters are developed. But it is the sluggishly paced second half that gets under your nerves.Pritam's music is disappointing, unlike the previous Abbas-Mustan flicks where the music elevated the mood of the films. Dialogues are contrived and bad.On the whole, 'Players' disappoints. Given that the film was hyped and was the first release of the year, this film might find a tough competition in the box office. I advice Abbas-Mustan to think of more 'Races' than 'Players'."
tt1784589,"Italian Job, an action thriller which was remake in 2003 now in Indian accent again in 2012 by Bollywood and it was seriously a waste of money time and energy. I wish they would have kept the way it was, unnecessary twists, unrealistic stunts and proud gesture by actors showing that they know about the future as they are going to win anyhow. Abhishek good at times but most of the time very over confident same goes for bipasha and actor like bobby deol completely wasted. Neil nitin mukesh did good job at times but he also gets irritating most of the time and Sonam Kapoor undefinable she does not even know how to act in a glamorous character. On the whole if Italian job is 8 out of 10 then this is 1 out of 100 seriously."
tt1784589,"Its Official remake of Hollywood Blockblaster The Italian Job, They bought the copyright and nothing to say about it, However I wonder if any of them can be alternative to Jason Statham, Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron..Poor script,bogus acting by majority of the actors just ruined the fun you expected from a heist movie... Firstto Acting:SONAM, she's just too much annoying,she does not have any decent acting talent unlike her father,the whole part of her was too much boring and unnecessary.....Now to Abhishek, I never thought he's going to be a thief! He looks acceptable as cop in DHOOM series but the same cop-like acting in this movie just disgusting,unacceptable.......Neil just passed the acting,Bobby was good,I really did not except such performance in movie like this,Kher just failed,he is weakest in the film alongside Sonam...Rest of the team I just wanna spend time by analyzing them,they are average.....Bipasha was better though the seducing character does not worthy to watch....I guess if it has the same story the the original without some extra characters like two lead actresses it would be much better......It looks poor, even much poor especially after watching Decent Hollywood like, Full2actions, awesome Scripted and Directed movie like DON 2, anyone isn't going to love Players...... Now to MUSIC:I think worst music ever made by Pritam,the dances even don't make sense with the songs. Direction:The Duo just made a Epic failed film with loose script,worst music and acting...sorry I can't even want to give it 2 stars...just 1 and I will recommend everyone to not see this title.....If you have seen The Italian Job and then watch this you will find yourself a sorry person... (Sorry for bad English)"
tt1784589,"Nothing much to say, but BOLLYWOOD strictly need to Learn to Imitate.
Not even a single worth remake makes sense.."
tt1784589,"When it comes to Abbas-Mustaan, the duo make great twist movies but they lift it off from Hollywood movies. TO set an example or maybe to avoid possible copyright issues, this time they actually bought the rights to the Italian Job franchise. The Italian Job was already a remake with its own rendition but Players is at times a scene by scene copy of the remake. Going forward to the movie, I knew that there would be some twists and it would try to be unique more so to stand out from the remake. Yet when I see The Italian Job, I see that it was a much better movie with good camera use and plenty of action. The remake misses the point.Firstly, there are some scenes which are revealed as twists from the very beginning when it was unnecessary. Abhishek Bachan's entry is revealed that way. Then there are other twists as well but nothing that will blow your mind off. As a matter of fact, you can guess all of the twists, and they themselves make the movie bland as it doesn't need twists.Secondly, the acting for the most part was standoffish. Sonam Kapoor did not act like a computer expert but rather someone who was more or less a snob. She was the most unlikable of the team and sounded very annoying. Her acting ability was mediocre as she delivered lines for the most part. Abhishek Bachan was neutral as usual. He does not act excited or stressed based on the circumstances but rather does his standard Dhoom performance. Bipasha Basu and Omi Vadya give their best performances while Neil Nitin Mukesh comes very close. Bipasha conveys emotions with grace but unfortunately the moments where she and Sonam quarrel are ruined by Sonam's snobbish delivery compared to Bipasha's authentic lines. Omi Vadya does his signature Marathi accent and does get to deliver some funny lines. The movie is funny because of him and he does being his role to be a memorable one even though some of his lines were forced. His partner, Anupam Kher's step-son, Sikander Kher gives a standard performance. Nothing that would make him leading actor material though. Neil Nitin Mukesh did try to match up to Edward Norton's performance from the remake and did play a angst-ridden nerd/stylish con-man with style. He has persona and gives a better performance than Abhishek. Vinod Khanna is refreshing after so many years but not enough screen time. Bobby Deol gives a good performance and Aftab does a small cameo. Johnny Lever is witty as usual but his performance is limited to his screen time. Overall, the movie did not have good editing and some scenes jumped looking more like they cut of scenes in the last moment due to time constraints. One moment the car crashes, next the theme is playing while they are elsewhere. The movie was abrupt with little to no character development, and an unbelievable heist plan which was more about luck than intelligence.I give it a 1/10 because it's a typical masala movie but bollywood could have done much better. It could have made in the 70's and it would have been entertaining then. It's unwatchable if you have seen The Italian Job and decent if you haven't seen it. Even then, the movie does not make sense and is not for the intelligent viewer. Save your money and go watch Don 2 for a more intelligent, but still not realistic heist movie."
tt1784589,"http://reviewforfilmmakers.blogspot.com/ https://twitter.com/abhishekjain118This is about only those things which as a viewer I didn't like.. When the bad guys already got accepted as protagonists in Indian films, there was no need of showing the humane side of the players.. in fact the most inhumane player – Neil Nitin Mukesh impressed the most. Yes it is true, not only recently but since 70' and 80' whenever our hero goes out for a theft, we love it. Kohinoor, Jewel Thief, Don2, Roop Ki Raani.. etc etc.. Accepted that hero always brings in some reason to steal but the trend is changing !! You can change too.. So there is the quick NOT-TO-DO check list for Abbas-Mustan's Players. 1. Remove good motives of Robbery i.e. Victor's dream project, Ronny's daughter.. make everything emotionless, professional. Though Sonam's reason to join for Victor's death was justified. 2. Take actors which can act. For star power, couple of them are OK. like rather than investing in Abhishek, Sonam, Bobby, Neil and Bipasha, pay more to 2 stars and 3 actors.. because among the 5 only Niel and Bipasha acted. 3. Bipasha's Engine work and Bobby's illusion on train windows were something too too much of science fiction to digest. Agreed that Indian audience is watching science fiction and gradually accepting such techno gigs but at the same time people have started applying logics also, the flags on the windows were clearly showing not spraying the solutions on the entire window. 4. Reduce songs and reduce the length of the movie. Sonam's gig on Bobby, Bipasha's dance for Russian general and Sonam-Abhishek drunken songs were too too too tiring and waste of time. Instead sonam and bipasha could have used smart lines to get their men. I like the talking people do the night clubs. 5. Instead of simply showing Sonam's tense face while hacking scenes, more theoretical information about how it is possible to find Spider would be better. 6. And last but not the least, you made the robbery seems pretty easy. People watch Mission Impossible franchise in India now. If not making the mission impossible, at least make it difficult.Note: The objective of this blog is to pick only loop holes and not so great things about the movie and NOT TO review the entire movie. General ratings from different critics holds true about the movie."
tt1784589,"Some may call this movie an Indian version of the Italian Job but there are differences if you wish to see it in that way. I first saw the Italian Job and within a few days after that, saw Players. I now have no doubt in saying that even though its a remake, you would not get that thought in mind that this is the story of the Italian job unless you see the huge similarities to the Italian Job later in the movie.Yes, the idea of the movie has been borrowed from the Italian Job but the main part, the thefts are quite original(not completely though). The first half is worth the watch. The robbery strategies are good. With little assumptions, you'll happily agree that the plan was superb.It's the second half in which you see a direct connection to the Italian Job. But Abbas-Mustan manage the connection well by putting twists at some important points in the movie. Though, towards the end, there is a rain of twists which you find hard to get. The twists timing falters this time unlike in ""Race"". Also, there is more talk and less action as you approach the end. What I really didn't like was the blooywood-ish ending. Why do you always need emotional endings. An action sequence or even hero tricking villain case could've been done. But then again, the plans in the second half are OK. Though, sometimes in the movie, you feel that there is a tinge of over-confidence among the characters and also that there are some things that seem impractical in the second half.In the long cast, the performances are:- Abhishek Bachchan: He has learned to hold a movie and whenever he's on screen, he gives you the feeling that he is the master. He looks confident and and comes up with a lead performance.Bobby Deol: He's been given a rather complex role (has too much in heart and brain and odd behavior). Though, he looks decent enough until he is eliminated.Bipasha Basu: She was very good. Totally into her character always. All her emotions and expressions land on time. Though her character seemed under-developed, she managed to live it up.Neil Mukesh: This guy has really got it in him. He comes up with a class performance but its just a few itchy dialogues of his that just doesn't let his performance rock above all.Sonam Kapoor: Not good. I don't think that I liked how she tried to picturize character as above all. Just too much unwanted attitude and some childish behavior come out of her. She is only good in the initial part when not in the serious frame of things, she does seem mature then.Vinod Khanna: Cameo. No need for comments. As involved in his character as ever. Even his role is rather light.Johnny Lever: His 10 minutes in the movie perhaps mark a sort of a comeback of his to a one-man comedy stand-up. He speaks flawlessly and brings out real laughter just using his timing and his expressions. His is perhaps the only performance that really stands out. None others do as his does.Omi Vaidya: He's still in his Bengali 3 idiots zone. Though, brings out some good punches enough to make you smile.Sikander Kher: I saw this guy for the first time and thought he is good for serious characters. He lacks that spark of a comedian which he sometimes tries to be in the movie. See his with your soft corner please.In the music part, I never noticed the songs as I watched it on TV. The only good song is in the album--> Dil Ye Bekarar Kyun Hai.Overall, Players is quite a good movie and its just that apart from a little mixed performances, some badly placed twists and suspenses and a little lack of originality, this movie is a treat for the first 2 hours but just dries up a little at the very end. Its sort of a 6.7 or 6.8 and so 7.This movie is thus underrated according to me and I think it is because of some career direction of a very good script."
tt1784589,"Players directed by Abbas-Mustan is an awful movie.The movie is said to be an official remake of The Italian Job.Although I have not seen The Italian Job,I found Players to be boring.Since the movie is a copy of Italian Job,so the story does not offer any originality.So no points for that.Story:- PLAYERS is about a team of skilled and sharp group of people -- Charlie (Abhishek Bachchan), Ronnie (Bobby Deol), Spider (Neil Nitin Mukesh), Riya (Bipasha Basu), Bilal (Sikander Kher) and Sunny (Omi Vaidya) -- who rob the gold bullion from Russia successfully. But one of them double crosses the players and the team sets out, with Naina (Sonam Kapoor) also included in their task now, to retrieve the booty and also settle scores.Neil Nitin Mukesh's performance is the only one that stays in your mind ever after this bad movie ends.So 1 point for that.Filmed at the panoramic locales of Russia, Netherlands, New Zealand and of course, India, the DoP (Ravi Yadav) bestows the film with an international look. In fact, it's an incredibly good looking film.So 1 point for that.Johny Lever(a guy common in Abbas-Mustan movies),even though has small role,still registers an impact.Half mark for that and the other for Sonam Kapoor,please don't mistaken me,its not for her acting but for her styling.Direction,Screenplay,Music and Dialogs are bad.Performances:- As mentioned above except Neil Nitin Mukesh and Johny Lever,none of them actually act well.Abhsiehk Bachchan is bad.Sonam Kapoor overacts.Bipasha Basu is average.Bobby Deol does not get to register an impact since because he is killed before the intermission.Sikander Kher is passable.Omi Vaidya is irritating this time.Vinod Khanna is fine.Aftab Shivdasani in a special appearance is subtle.On the whole Players is a let-down."
tt1784589,"Very bad version of the Italian job, hurts to watch!!!"
tt1784589,"I watched, in agony, this film last night and I had to watch the Original Italian Job twice just to get over this, a poor attempt to make a classic remake, even the Hollywood remake was acceptable and above all else: Abhishek Bachchan is a disgrace to Michael Caine, this film only had nice effects and that was it, Bipasha and Sonam were unnecessary and the betrayal was poorly executed. This film had rights to the original, it could have been an instant classic, but somehow Abhishek is worthy enough to do the role Michael Caine did? This was a terrible film in general, and a remake of a 5 star classic not taken seriously. It'd be asking someone to remake Goodfellas and him giving you Adulthood, or asking them to remake Die Hard and they give you Singham , just a terrible film"
tt1784589,Such bad editing and acting and remake of the Hollywood film oh my god don't watch it
tt1784589,"For an Abbas-Mustan Burmawala Bros. movie,you expect thrills with twists & turns.Players has those,but not enough to surprise the audience to a great extent.With movies like Soldier,Ajnabee,Race there were shocking moments which had the so-called ""woooooo""factor in it.Players fails in this aspect.More to say the music was highly uninteresting ,to be fair unnecessary. ""The Italian Job"" was a great movie with everything-story,direction,actors dealt with perfection.While Players did copy its story ,direction-wise it was all rite,but the major problem was its casting.You may be shooting in Russia,New Zealand or any other wonderful place,but when you have an inexperienced and weak cast,the movie shows its sign of bleakness.While Abhisek,Neil,Bipasha were good,Sonam,Sikander and Omi Vaidya(the all-time irritating guy) were wrongly casted.Bobby Deol,a tremendous actor by himself(likes of Barsaat,YPD,Soldier) was wasted.Comic timings of Johny lever seems to be deteriorating day-by-day. All-in-all Players did try to repeat the feat what The Italian Job had,but failed due to some insensitive decisions(casting,music).One time watch movie............hey,just a second........not in theatres,just wait for its satellite release"
tt1784589,"This was not the kind of start expected for 2012. The movie lost its audience in the first 20 minutes itself. Poorly scripted dialogs, complemented with pathetic dialog delivery, below par acting by people who have been in the industry for more than a decade now (especially Abhi and Bips), poor punches and lot of technical mistakes is what you see in the first half n hour of the movie. The only three stars that I give to the movie is because of slightly better second half where the execution of the plot was slightly better and the twist in the climax - the only original thing about the movie. The biggest difference between Italian Job and Players is the build up of the story. While the English flick detailed each and every step of the robbery and provided logical and believable reasoning for the same, Players just rushed through the execution with many steps unexplained. The story was build up very poorly with many loose ends. Is it really necessary in Bollywood to portray Hero as good? Why would thieves be good at heart? Goa police can actually sue the producers for their portrayal. After watching the movie I kept wondering if this is the same Abbas- Mustan jodi which made Baazigar, Khiladi, Aitraaz and Race? They even made a good Soldier out of Bobby Deol. It's time they do some retrospection on what they are doing."
tt1784589,"There are some Bollywood films that have gained notoriety for being unofficial remakes of recognizable Hollywood films, and a handful comes to mind, even for blockbusters like Ghajini and Krrish. But there are some in the industry who will go the legitimate way of seeking rights and having their films become official remakes, such as Farah Khan's Tees Maar Khan (remaking After the Fox starring Peter Sellers), and now the Alibhai Burmawalla brothers Abbas and Mastan's Players, a remake of The Italian Job, which in itself was given a fairly recent makeover starring Mark Wahlberg to which this film is more closely aligned, compared to the Michael Caine starred original.What does Bollywood then bring to the table in a remake of a film? For starters, the song and dance sequences had to be naturally weaved into the narrative, otherwise without which it couldn't have come from India's filmmaking machinery. Running almost three hours long, the film contains of cleverly inserted pieces especially used when the female characters have to seduce their way into fulfilling their objectives. Those involving Bipasha Basu worked since the actress is known for being sultry although one can tell of her losing some weight and curves, while Sonam Kapoor seemed to have bulked up a little (for the better rather than being painfully pencil thin) but for her dances to be a little bit awkward when she was supposed to be sensual.Like most Bollywood treatment, a fair deal goes into the build up prior to the intermission, and in this case the film had taken its time to introduce all its key characters, starting with the top player in the business, the thieving Charlie Masceranhas (Abhishek Bachchan) who together with Bipasha's Riya form a tag team of sorts who go out to raid from the most unsuspecting of victims, in a prologue taking place in Amsterdam. They soon get onto an opportunity for the heist of some stolen Romanian gold bars which are en route back from Russia to Romania, and under the guidance of jailed mastermind Victor (Vinod Khanna), become part of a star studded team of talented individuals brought together to pull off the robbery. This ensemble includes Bobby Deol as Ronnie the magician and illusionist, who are very technically creative folks, Neil Nitin Mukesh as Spider the computer hacker, Sikander Kher as Bilal Bashir the explosives expert and engineer, and Omi Vaidya (who shot to fame with his debut in 3 Idiots) as the actor and make up artist Sunny.If you're already familiar with The Italian Job movies, the team gets double-crossed from within after successfully pulling off the job of their lives through meticulous preparation and planning, leaving in actual fact most of the story about how this lack of honour amongst thieves had the survivors of the betrayal band together to exact revenge through, you guessed it, another heist of their own against the betrayer. In this Hindi remake however, the double crossing goes on for quite a fair bit, and as such allowed room to stretch the narrative, which no thanks to a very verbose, dialogue laden nature having everyone explain their one-upmanship to their opponents, became a little bit of an unwelcome drag, sacrificing an action packed finale, for one that's marred with plenty of stand offs, posturing and bogged by the ol' villain/hero monologues stating the very obvious, which the directing duo tried to painstakingly show that they didn't really cheat by showing that they had clues planted in the scenes all along.With all masala entertainers, the film has its fair share of carefully crafted set action pieces to wow and to thrill, especially its central piece of having a turbo charged train in hot pursuit of their mark, and the iconic Italian Job mini cars that zip through insanely crowded road traffic. In some instance the chases involving the minis got overshadowed somehow and didn't play a big part in the film, though credit to the filmmakers for tossing things up and adding a new flavour of their own even to surprise those who have watched the originals. Romance also features heavily in this Hindi version, with a love triangle set up between Charlie, Riya and Victor's daughter Naina (Sonam Kapoor), though it had the latter bogged down with jealousy for the most parts, and had its focus distinctly split down by the interval, with Charlie and Riya's arc in the first half, followed by the growing affections Charlie has for Naina when it calls for some sacrifice to be done.Players is an adequately stylish remake of The Italian Job, with high production values that didn't scrimp on making this one giant, jet setting epic, hopping between countries and cities, from Russia to New Zealand, from St Petersburg to Moscow, Auckland to Wellington. Action thrillers coming from Bollywood have improved leaps and bounds with recent offerings such as Don 2 pulling out all the stops in terms of locales and stunts, going beyond the shores of India and doing their utmost to appeal to an international audience by meeting the standards set by the best in the business. It may not be that flawless action flick, but it certainly contained all the right ingredients necessary to be so."
tt1784589,"Bollywood end 2011 with an action packed thriller Don 2 and start the year with another action thriller. Player is a typical Abbas Mastan style movie, action, suspense, drama and glamor. When I first heard about that movie I learned that it is inspired by an Hollywood movie Italian Job fortunately i didn't watch that hence everything for me is fresh. It is a plot about a Train Robbery with 1000 Crore Gold. The whole portion of robbery is breathless and very well justify and you hardly find any flaw. A perfect plan with great execution. However Director forget to justify the inclusion of Sikadnar Kher (Bilal) in the team as an explosive expert as there was not a big deal in train robbery but you must keep it in mind that an explosive expert is in team and his presence in the team justified in end. Perhaps they steal the gold but soon after that director start twisting the film. The first half full with a great robbery and the second half is full of suspense. One thing which was missing in Don 2 was humanity and emotion but here these aspect of any good film are also exist as cold blooded murder of Soonam Kapoor's s Father Winod Khanna playing as a mentor of these con people. Abnishek is wonderful, Bobby Deol did great with what was his part but the one who steal the show was Neil Nitin Mukesh the main villain. Audience was mesmerized with the pace of the film it will not give you a dull moment except the one when Sonam Kapoor visited Neil Nitin Mukesh Castle and sing and dance in a very pathetic manner. The only thing which remind you that it is a Bollywood movie. Otherwise the entire production is not bellow of Hollywood Movie. The only aspect the movie lack was music. If you have any plan to go for a movie, player has a better plan."
tt1784589,"I'm a movie lover, I like all kinds of films, so this isn't a fussy review only complaining about bad things.We all know what this film is about. So here I come to the main part:- I expected a lot better from this film, but yes it didn't stand up till the expectations BUT it stood up from what bad I expected from it.Let me tell what I found in checkpoints:- Difference in the remake - The plot is basically the same as the Italian Job but the character backgrounds, back-story and locations are different.Theme - This movie has many twists. Most are good but unfortunately VERY predictable. Any other movie has them. Many of the scenes were unnecessary and twists were overdone which made them bends.Cast & Acting - The main characters are Abhishek (Charlie), Sonam (Naina), Bipasha (Ria), Neil (Spider), Sikander (Bilal), Omi (Sunny) and Bobby (Ronnie).Starting, Abhishek has maintained the SAME style from Dhoom series which is normally fine but here its unacceptable with his cop look. Sonam, sorry to say, but she performed worst here. Her dialogs and acting just wasn't fine, even her taunting in the film was better. Sikander, I don't know, not much of a big star. The good ones were Bipasha & Neil. Bipasha's some elegant acting was like a foil to Sonam's bratty attitude. Omi was okay, he provides the comic role. Neil I would say was good but directing little destroyed it. Now surprisingly Bobby was nice, but sadly he didn't get a decent role (you'll know why). There's also Johhny Lever in a small role, he's also comedy but somehow seems by time he doesn't get good punches..Songs - In film very bad, on TV or internet, very good. Look on internet, you'll find some decent songs like ""Jhoom Ta Hoon Main"" & ""Dil Ye Bekaraar"". But in films they MOSTLY used the less better ones. Songs are a BIG thing to hit a film, I'm surprised why didn't the directors include them.Directing - This is what didn't fit. The director duo who're great did very wrong things in the film. They DID add nice scenes but COULD NOT present them well. The using was wrong. Some copies, many improvisations, good idea, not great presentation.My opinion - After seeing my not so favorable comments, I surprisingly say that Players was NOT a bad film. It was okey-dokey. It was long and the first half was boring, second half picked up better but twists broke it. Some unneeded melodrama makes its little shabby, but has pace IF you haven't seen the Italian Job.Verdict - As said, okay type. LOT of editing needed, but not terrible. 6.25 out of 10.P.S. - 1 very important thing I want to say that this film doesn't has that much thriller supposed, but contains nothing bad. If you have any intention to watch the film you can surely go for it on discount weekdays or something. Nowadays people don't see the film and only judge by the cast even BEFORE watching a film, like a book's cover, please DON'T. If UTTERLY HORRIBLE USELESS and almost BRAINLESS films like Ready can be a super hit JUST because of Salman, then India is unfair. This is AT LEAST better than Ready, depends on your taste.Believe me, I watched it and I know its underrated. Films like Chandni Chowk to China & Love Story 2050 are also underrated. No, they don't deserve to be hits but what was bad in them? They tried something new and they were fine for watching on TV like this movie is. :|"
tt1784589,"So, guys get ready to watch a repeat telecast of The Italian job (Wahlberg, Statham 2003 movie) with a last moment twist and songs :DThe complete story is just a copy of the Italian job and Nothing new. Initially, i thought it would be a great movie. The actors did a good job though especially Sonam Kapoor (she is looking hot) and Omi Vaidya with his coming timing. The background score of the movie is good. I was expecting more from the director Abbas Mustan but they have the same thing to give i.e. one of the lady in the movie would turn out to be on the villain side (Remember Race).All in all don't expect too much from this movie. If you don't have any movie to watch then go for this."
tt2515086,"The movie is for Directioners (One Direction fans) and no one else. I went with my two 1D-mad friends, who loved it. I am not crazy for them, but I am fond of them and love Harry and Zayn, so I found most of it entertaining. I spent £8 on this film, which is why I didn't give it a ten out of ten because it wasn't really worth all the money...I'd pay a fiver. There are some moments in it where I couldn't stop laughing. Louis is particularly funny! Anyway, my two friends also thought it was very 'emotional' and cried in most parts. I didn't cry, but I guess I would if I was a proper PROPER fan! It's got all the songs in it for the music fans, plus all the backstage exclusive videos and rehearsals. Plus, you get to see all their families and what it's like on a tour bus. My only complaint would be that it didn't really make me love them anymore. It only told me what I already knew. Overall though, it's worth a try if you're not a Directioner and a must see if you are!"
tt2515086,"I'm gonna start off by saying that I know that I am not the target audience for this movie. This is for the prepubescent little girls who like their ""music"". But, a documentary should entertain someone no matter what the topic. A good documentary would entertain anyone no matter if they like what the documentary is about or not. That being said, this movie does not do that. It is pretty much an hour and a half long commercial for One Direction; not a movie. This movie was like the first 20 minutes of the movie 'Moonwalker' but if it was the whole movie. I can't exaggerate enough on how this is the worst documentary ever. If you wanna sit through a hour and a half long infomercial then be my guest. But, if you have a functioning brain and would rather watch something that resembles a movie then I'd stay away from this."
tt2515086,"If Lee Daniel's The Butler business is surpassed by this crap,then i would say that everything is possible.The film contains enough gratuitous naked torsos that it is sure to satisfy those fans. But is it of interest to anyone else? It is a chance to ponder just why these five ""boys,"" who range in age from 19 to 21, are pegged as the new Justin Biebers. Unlike Mr. Bieber, they don't seem to be musical prodigies. Only one plays an instrument on stage, and none of them dance well.With a group so evidently versed in the visuals of rock history , it's a shame that a filmmaker wasn't hired who would pay homage to classic pop films instead of offering a satisfactory paid promotional. In the end credits — Richard Lester-style scenes of the boys in costumes doing pranks — we see how this film might have been more successful: as an obvious fiction starring these appealing personalities rather than a tame and somewhat fake documentary.Another addition to worthless crap movies that's business is surpassing precious gems like The Butler."
tt2515086,"TO sum this all up Its Terrible don't watch this sh** i really hope piracy gets even stronger so these losers don't make anymore money selling there terrible music. Seriousely why bring out a movie with themselves in it why not bring out a music video like normal artists, its just pure greed, nothing but greed............. . .. . .By submitting this review you are agreeing to the terms laid out in our Copyright Statement.

tt2515086,"This is the worst ""documentary"" I have ever seen in my life. Not that I am a One Direction fan anyway or anything but still all that means is I went in with zero expectations and still was blown away by how unbelievably awful this is. The only thing worse would be to hand a bunch of kids a video camera and let them tape themselves go to the beach, ride in a bus, do some shows for their friends, because basically that is what this ""professional documentary team"" has given us here with this band. They're not a terrible band as far as boy bands go, with OK voices and dance moves, but most boy bands stink and this one is no different. Play some instruments well or something! What is the point of these guys? Almost as little point as there is in this movie existing, watching a bunch of guys pretending to be younger than they are and desperate to look ""real"" and ""cool"". Skip this movie if you don't want to get the strong urge to stick knives in your eyes and ears."
tt2515086,"Obviously a 10/10, love 1d and miss them a lot. also harry can have my heart and zayn's voice is something else"
tt2515086,"I'm 46 and the father of five daughters, the three youngest being in the One-Direction target age: 12th, 8th, and 6th grade. My daughters (including a 22 and 20 year-old) have managed not to go gaga over the Back Street Boys, N-Sync, the Jonas Brothers, Justin Bieber, and the like. 1D has been a little different, in that they caught my girls' interest and have kept it. My youngest three wanted to see this, and I surprised them on Labor Day by taking them. I thought about just dropping them off, but am glad I didn't. I read a critic's review that basically said that these guys are truly nice, decent guys, and that that comes through in the movie. It does. I'm a huge Beatles' fan, so for me, much of the movie was spent not only enjoying the music (really, it's not bad stuff) and their humble and charming personalities, but also evaluating the sociological aspects of their ""Beatlemania""-type popularity. Here's what's interesting in the comparison. Unlike the Beatles, these guys are not skilled musicians and phenomenal songwriters. Mainly, they just sing, and they're good at that. What lies under their popularity are two things that also lay under the Beatles': 1) they are very humorous and relaxed (lots of quick, on-the-fly, funny comments); and 2) they're working-class boys (lads) who are really great friends and enjoy each other. With the Beatles, I've always thought that their palpable friendship and fun humor were the factors that made them so magnetic--they enjoyed each other, were great friends, and had fun with each other on stage and off. This is even more true for One Direction, as you don't have the leadership struggle with 1D that was there between John and Paul, nor the building resentment of a George. None of One Direction is trying to become the leader, and all are avoiding being the Justin Timberlake or the Sting. They really care for each other, are great friends, and, most striking to me, are tremendously and truly humble about their success. Along with this, they verbalize many times how each member is necessary, how they'd be less successful (or may not have even made it) had one member been missing, how it was a freak of nature/act of God, so to speak, that they wound up together, and that they'd all be doing menial jobs back home right now (factory worker, fireman, working in a bakery), were it not for their fans making them big (and they're really appreciative of their fans, and treat them well). Last thing on this: there's a segment when they go back home, and we see none of them acting like a big deal with any of the folks in their home towns. That was really refreshing.Certainly these guys aren't the musical giants the Beatles were--not even close. But just as fun, even to adults? Yes, and maybe even a little more so. This movie, the ""Hard Day's Night"" of One Direction, was a really fun watch."
tt2515086,"Okay, so I'm a massive directioner, I can understand why people are commenting saying they do not like it because it is about a boy band whose fans in general are teenagers like themselves. I don't understand though why people are commenting saying its sh*t and a waste of time, surely if they think so strongly that way, they would of realised near enough at the start of the film if it was for them or not, and if they decide it wasn't then go and 'make better use of the your time' I think that it is a perfect film for directioners, and the boys should be proud of their achievements and their stories, and making this film is one of them."
tt2515086,"I'm surprised I sat through this whole thing at all in 2018. I love harry more than life and I would love to watch back his cute moments but it's almost weird to think I actually liked the way they used to act (don't know if they still do now though, other than Zayn and Harry haven't kept up with the others. Maybe it was just adolescence but I've definitely grown up from enjoying this. Anyways I'm giving a high rating for harry because ugh hes so darn cute i could watch him forever"
tt2515086,"OK, so I watched this movie as part of a thing I do where I watch the US box office number ones from one year prior and now it was time for the 1D flick. Apart from a few guilty pleasure songs, I don't really love this band like a lot of the screaming teenagers that the movie shows. Still whether we like them or not, there's no denying they're huge right now. Now if this success is to continue, that's another discussion. So I sat back and grooved to some songs I like and learned a little more about them. It wasn't something I desperately needed to know, but since I was already watching it, I ended up just finding out about this. Now as far as the boys go, I can see that this can be quite overwhelming for them and that they are just normal young people looking for a good time. One Direction has become a very loved, but also hate band. Personally I always separate the music from the individual and as far as I'm concerned, they seem like nice lads. So my advice is if you're a directioner definitely watch this, and if you're not, well if you don't mind them, see it just for the sake of actually seeing them as they are and not the product they're sellingRating: 4,5/10"
tt2515086,"well, I'm going to be honest I'm a huge 1d fan.... but this movie was horrible! way too scripted, too much promotion, no actual stories to tell... but one direction fans are always there.. this movie was clearly directed for us and none else, which is the main reason why i didn't like it.. don't watch it.. i repeat do NOT waste money buying, renting, whatever! you will thank me laterWARNING do not watch do not watch do not watch do not watch do not watch do not watch do not watch do not watch do not watchGood parts: maybe the fact we see them backstage really, the main scenes people screamed at in the theater were parts with Harry's shirt off (once again targeted at teens), and I have to admit it was quite overwhelming ;)Horrid parts: the part with harry and liam talking.. was horrible, just waaay to scripted, see for yourself once again, you will thank me later.."
tt2515086,"No words can explain how god awful this movie is. If I were a producer of this movie, I would be ASHAMED to release it. Everything about this movie...everything is terrible. These kids walk around acting like freaking superstars yet I speak for a lot of people when I say: NO ONE CARES. There is nothing to like about this movie. The only possible up sight to this movie is when the credits roll. Just these kid's SINGING is terrible, let alone what they do in their free time. Movies like this make me miss Guns N' Roses,, AC/DC, etc, back when music was decent. This band sounds like they are constantly sucking on Helium. I seriously do not see how ANYBODY likes these people. And so I implore you: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. IT IS TERRIBLE. If One Direction walked toward me, I'd walk in the OTHER direction."
tt2515086,"First of all, I know I'm not in the target demographic for this movie, but I feel like an interesting and informative documentary can be made about something no matter what its subject matter is. And this movie... ugh. I'm not going to go out on a limb and say that One Direction: This Is Us is the worst movie I've ever seen, because then someone could bring a different one to my attention that's even worse, but I will say that it's definitely the worst concert documentary I've ever seen. And even that feels really wrong, because at the end of the day, this was just propaganda. As a movie, nothing happens in it. As a documentary, it relies on the audience already knowing everything about this band. And as something called ""This Is Us,"" I don't even leave it knowing all their names, much less anything else about them. There's no plot that it builds up to, there's no conflict or resolution, and this seems to be a common problem in the era when any schmuck pop star can get a theatrical movie made about them (such as Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, and the Jones Brothers). And for a 3D movie, there isn't even anything interesting to look at apart from the five guys in the band going around and pointing at things. I actually lost a lot of respect for its director Morgan Spurlock when I saw this movie. It felt like he wanted to make a better movie that wasn't just a huge commercial, but was held back by someone--probably the record company--and instead made this. I'm glad to see that even some of the band's own fans are seeing through this quick grab for cash and are leaving negative reviews. Movies like this are created with zero effort and are only made to steal fans' money, because the people who make these movies know that some people will buy anything as long as it has a popular band's name attached."
tt2515086,Most people might not like this because its up to date to their fans liking. Its not just delivering boring facts and all but showing their journey and showing their fans that they're having fun
tt2515086,"Back when I used to watch the original X-Factor these guys were on, but being that boy bands are more miss than hit, at least with my music taste, I would skip their performances. A few years later, after them losing, they are now following in many other musicians' footsteps and releasing a documentary/ concert movie. But, the question is: can this movie convert you into a fan, or is just made for their established audience?Characters & StoryOf the band you can see Harry, Zayn and Niall are the potential breakouts with Liam and Louis having their place, but not being as charismatic or interesting. The reason for this is three (Harry, Zayn and Niall) all have this sort of appeal in which they seem like they could be the leads. For example, Harry comes off as the sort of modern version of Mick Jagger, though with less drugs; Zayn seems a bit more modern in comparison with him seeming like he would work within a modern emo-pop band; and then Niall seems like your general boy next door, which is his appeal. Together, though Harry and Zayn more so, they seem to get the most focus when it comes to interview segments, seeing their families, or life before fame, than the others.As for the film as a whole, between songs from their first two albums and interview segments, as well as us seeing them venture around tour stops, that is what makes up the movie. You learn what they did before X-Factor, slightly, and then what happened in the lead up to their audition; you hear about some of the band drama like Louis and Liam not being fond of one another, during their time on X-Factor; and them once thinking of kicking out Zayn; but for the most part you see a strong brotherhood in which it seems together they are far stronger as a group than they would be as solo artist.PraiseBe it the fact that some members, naturally, have more name recognition than others, it was good, to me, that the people who you'd recognize the most are the ones who got the most screen time. And while I may not be the aimed for demographic, I did like two of the songs within the film. Those two not so great I would want to download them, but I do think when you watch the film, despite how asinine the idea is, you can understand why they are being compared to The Beatles, past them both being British boy bands.I mean, One Direction seems physically/ visually fit for the times. They are a bunch of tattooed model looking boys, but they aren't cookie cutter per se. More so, they are almost like a PG version of the Jackass crew. And, like The Beatles, currently they are in a phase in which their aim, more so, is mainstream music to appeal to a female fan base, no different from when The Beatles were doing ""She Loves You,"" ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" and their other classics. But, the question does remain if the boys' music will grow up and become deeper, or if they simply will just look edgy, but continue to sing songs which are as shallow as a kiddy pool.CriticismLet it be known, this film isn't likely to convert you. For one, there isn't really any background into any of the songs to make them seem deeper than they appear, and while you must admire their fans for taking them to where they are, between the songs and who we see of their fandom, you can tell that they aren't trying to appeal to anyone past a female demographic.But perhaps my main issue is that there isn't much of a narrative when it comes to the film. In other concert films there is usually a build toward something, be it like Kevin Hart's Let Me Explain in which we followed him on his way to Madison Square Garden or Michael Jackson's This Is It which chronicled his preparations for his would-be arena stay. However, for This Is Us we are basically just following them around in a style no better than what fellow British Band Little Mix had when their band went to Japan, with the only difference being that One Direction goes to more places and Little Mix posted their videos to YouTube. Thus making the film, outside the concert element, feel like bits which could have been put on YouTube years before the film, but they were saving it for a movie in hopes of making as much money Miley Cyrus or Justin Bieber made with their concert films.Overall: TV ViewingHonestly, I'm not even sure why a fan would buy this unless they are the type of fan which likes to collect everything the band ever put out. I say this because there are likely full, uninterrupted, concerts on YouTube and better interviews also within the same site. So, it makes this film seem like just a ploy for cash, more than something really trying to let you into the boys world and give you the opportunity to get to know them and their music. Because of that, I say this is a TV Viewing type of movie. Something which doesn't need to be bought, or rented, for it doesn't have that type of value where it needs to be seen as soon as it is accessible."
tt2515086,"It is difficult to understand why anyone would pan this movie.I watched this on an 8 foot high-definition screen. The images are razor sharp, the color is wonderful, the editing is in a modern style but not too jumpy. The story flow should keep your attention. On a decent 5.1 surround system the sound quality is very good. If there were technical flaws I was in a good position to find them. I didn't find any.You get to see the members of the group perform and go about their lives. If you say (like one reviewer) that it was too scripted then you weren't paying attention. The boys revel in being spontaneous and doing what they want to do and wearing what they want to wear, or so it seems. It kept my interest.All in all it was just fun - and I'm not even a fan."
tt0979891,"I saw this movie on TV as i thought it might be good seeing Nana's acting and paresh's acting ; i kept seeing the movie but i thought the scenes between kunal and reema should have been well adjusted it seems as if they don't have any as much importance in the story , also it is hard to understand why is Nana patekars character so angry on Cricket! . But I think Paresh's story was at least better amongst the three and that of Nana seemed to Catch munnabhai mbbs effect though not successful.And why do they always show the sufferings Indians have to go in U.K c'mon get some another plot like why not go to U.S or Pakistan etc.I will give this movie 6/10 as i thought it was at least better than remaining movies running on TV"
tt0979891,"A different type of approach in comedy, a good movie for one time watch. I liked the different approach. It did have the potential to be better movie. Comic timing was perfect. Overall it is slightly a above average entertainer."
tt5990444,"People who enjoyed movies like How High or half baked, will also like this movie. It has some Funny dialogue by yours truly Mike Epps. Dont ecpect much but if your looking for a movie such as the ones mentioned then give it a shot."
tt5990444,There's this one scene where the characters are out of sync with the audio. First I thought they were doing it to represent that they were high but it wasn't. I thought TIP was a perfectionist but I don't think he was there in the editing room
tt5990444,"""The Trap"" (2019) is a semi-professionally produced comedy about an family owned restaurant based in Atlanta being run into the ground by Dutch, played by Mike Epps, through his immature neglect, only to be saved by Sonny, an up and coming cook in the Big Easy, played by rapper T.I.. Through Dutch's bad decision, a new recipe is created for the fried chicken that ultimately could get the eatery shut down and everyone arrested. The film reminds me of some of the less than bright people I grew up with providing a slight level of nostalgia. On the other hand, aside from the strong tie into family struggles and lessons, this film was a little rough. This film had many holes and more technical issues than I wish to count.Some of the acting is pretty accurate for the personas that portrayed them, but it may have led to the storyline dragging a bit too much. The film filled the ""standard"" 90 minutes but could have easily been cut down to help move the film along, but this isn't my biggest issue with the film. The sound syncing has points where is extremely off and blatantly takes me out of the story. There are also visual issues where, like in the hospital, the camera operator can be seen. I originally had hi hopes for this film thanks to some names in the comedy and hip- hop world, but I was let down. Overall, this film isn't that good because the quality is a major misfire, but I still enjoyed it."
tt5990444,"I know what this was supposed to be a fun, light-hearted, just for laughs type of movie that you can watch with a group of friends and have a good time, like the classic Friday. But this aint it!!It popped up on my suggestions on Netflix and I saw T.I. and Epps was on it, so I clicked. They've done some really good and funny stuff so I know a movie with them would be decent. I was wrong.I enjoy a good-bad low budget movie, with sub par acting and plot, but this was all over place. The overacting was strong on this one. And you can tell a lot of the dialogue was off script, which was supposed to make it funnier, but it would end up just going and going to the point where it got awkward. Even the great Loretta seemed like an amateur. Dialogue and direction is that bad.There are times it's obvious people were simply added to give the actor something funny to say, but it goes nowhere.This movie had potential...I liked the premise. Better handling of the script, better supporting actors and keeping a tighter leash on the dialogue could've taken it from a F movie to the B level that it wanted to be.I judge a movie by how easily I can recreate it. I could've rounded up a couple of friends and video taped a quick story just like this one. There was nothing special about it other than it's cast. A for effort. F for the fact that they squandered all of the talent they had to work with.If you're 13 years old or just looking for a movie you want to play in the background of a party just to have something on, this is perfect."
tt5990444,"Wow, this movie if i can call it a movie, is so bad, it made me make a review, first ever. Just added on Netflix, seen 5 mins and gave up. I like Mike Epps, he is a funny guy, he plays great, but this is some D class video, cant be called a movie. I guess the budget was low, as low as the people density in this video, which seems filmed in a forgotten town ... Anyway, very bad movie, dont worth watching."
tt5990444,You can see a camera and cameraperson's hand in the hospital scene. Wow. WOW
tt5990444,"I was so surprised this movie was so bad because Queen Latifa and T.I are in the movie and are really good actors.
The movie looks really low budget and just isn't funny. They tried to make a good movie but nothing came together right"
tt5990444,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrible writing, acting, directing! Jesus!!!"
tt5990444,"This is a movie for the culture. It's got some of our favorites like Mike, Loretta, Monique, & DC. This was before all the drama with Tip went down, so I understand some of the bad reviews and ratings.The trap is a movie about a man who is a top chef who is given an opportunity to start a restaurant in Los Angeles. However, instead of opening that restaurant, family is prioritized which leads to another opportunity being pursued instead. It's something we in the culture can relate to because how many of us have had dreams we wanted to pursue, only for our path to be determined, delays, or detoured by family. It's not a bad thing, but it's a reality. The good part in this movie, howeve, is that everyone wins."
tt5990444,"Although, I liked T.I. better in other movies. This movie was funny so for that reason I gave them a high rating."
tt5990444,"The Trap is a blaxsploitation film in the vein of Friday, The Wash, Pootie Tang, etc. -- so expect the imdb score to be low due to all the hate voting.Truth is, if you're looking for a black-casted comedy, The Trap is pretty standard Mike Epps fare. It's got plenty of laughs and the usual racially-charged comedy (and the usual weed jokes throughout). But The Trap also has a lot of spirit, and TI does a great job as the head of the fried chicken joint. There's a sense of comraderie in The Trap that isn't in other Epps comedies.Everything is stereotypical here (as are all Mike Epps films), and that's part of what make Epps films tick the way that they do. Don't go into this expecting some form of highbrow and erudite humor, and you won't be disappointed. Go into this expecting a decent popcorn flick that'll harkon you back to the Next Friday days, and you'll be more than content.A solid 6/10 when comparing it to other blaxploitation genre greats--definitely worth a watch for likeminded individuals."
tt5990444,"Horrible acting, bad story line, revolting directing. There is no acting or directing difference between emotions, the sound is irritating. I honestly don't think there's a worse movie out there."
tt5990444,"Cameras showing, cameraman showing, repeated shots, terrible acting, terrible directing, everything is bad. Great for keeping you company while you do other stuff though."
tt5990444,"This rachet story about
weed fried chicken, embarrassed me on so MANY levels! As a black
woman; Atlanta resident
and a medical professional! That pathetic hospital side story was GOD AWFUL! A doctor discussing the cost of treatment!! Really!?!There were so many mistakes that Stevie Wonder could SEE them!I have seen better acting
at the Funeral Home!!This moving dumpster
fire was DOA!! If I could have given it 10 negative
stars I would! Note to
Teyana Taylor, you have ONE character that you can play, foul mouthed
ghetto hood rat! Take some ACTING lessons!!"
tt5990444,"Wow. T.I.? Really? Wtf! Who directed this crap? Sorry to that person fpr what I'm about to post...quit. Quit now before you become remember for this caliber of movie. Low budget is all good but I couldn't even give this movie any more of my time. Not one thing in the first 30 minutes was engaging, I just stopped paying attention which led me to this site and my post. Netflix needs to hear about this foolery and the fact that Netflix added this movie has ruined any street cred this person may have had. Shame!"
tt5990444,Avoid it at all cost.Bad acting and racism against white people.
tt5990444,"Not the best acting jobs TI or Queen Latifah have put on, however Mike Epps keeps the laughs coming. It is worth watching."
tt5990444,Ti is a very veryVERY BAD actor LIKE THE WORST ever!! along with dc. Everyone else did good. Story line boring and old. NOTHING about this is original .
tt5990444,"Really good film, laughed so much, music in the background was also brilliant. Great acting from all cast."
tt5990444,Had some very funny scenes. I thought this a funny movie.
tt5990444,It is so bad that it is funny. Insanely bad acting
tt5990444,"Please don't waste your time. Horrible acting, horrible direction, horrible script and horrible idea from jump street. Even the audio is horrible!!! I expected more from TI."
tt9865554,"This short film has nothing interesting to offer the viewer. It has little to no dialogue which I think is lazy in any movie. It has little to no story. Also, the titular character isn't a character. We know nothing about her and learn nothing about her. It is a waste of 13 minutes."
tt9865554,"Can I get my 13 minutes back please? This film is pointless and a complete waste of energy and time. I am not sure if they were trying to evoke Jack the Ripper or something, but it was terrible."
tt9865554,"Return of attack of the killer tomatoes was much better than this. The short is simply a race bating BLM wet dream where a young white female is wandering around in a dubious highly ethnic part of London at night. She approaches various people who aren't white, eventually attacks one with a weapon.If you see this on the Shudder streaming service, don't waste 13 mins you'll never get back. I'm not sure why this is even on there."
tt9196244,"....so if you go in with *extremely* low expectations and the knowledge that this will probably be the dumbest, most asinine thing you'll ever see, it's actually enjoyable and really freaking funny."
tt9196244,"This is a really really bad show. Between the music, the filming, the people and the premise it's amazing how this show even became an actual thing to watch. There is something very wrong with the shooting or directing. It looks like they are all bad actors pretending to be on an awful game show. N"
tt9196244,"I really thought there are pieces of golden humor here. It has so much potential. The thing that really irritates me is how the hosts ALWAYS comment about the challenges the same way. Like: ""what could this be?"" or ""I'm worried, what is the battery used for?""
It's like they are trying to get a reaction for the audience in the room, but c'mon Netflix.... you know people binge. We literally saw a battery in the last episode used the exact same way. You know what the battery is for, we know what the battery is for, the audience in the studio will figure it out. There is different commentary they could choose to say, but the route they took makes me feel like its disingenuine. Makes me lose interest and I really want to like this show."
tt9196244,"A visceral nightmare.A man gags and cringes over rotten, maggot-infested meat and gets jabbed in the side with a cattle prod, quick cut to raucous laughter. More gagging, crying, retching. More laughter, it's hysterical. I can't look away but it feels like my brain is dying.Maybe this is some kind of elaborate stealth Black Mirror promotion, maybe it is a genuine reflection of the hellscape that is living in this world in 2019.(Why are they in a barn??)"
tt9196244,"If you want to watch a gross-out game show, watch Fear Factor. If you want to see a bunch of idiots hurt themselves or each other, watch Jackass. If you want to watch cringey millennials fail at things, watch YouTube. This show is the worst parts of all of those thrown into a blender and the result is just terrible. After Bill Nye's Netflix show I thought they had hit rock bottom but here we are."
tt9196244,Didn't find this show amusing at all. Sean Walsh probably didn't help!
tt9196244,"This is THE WORST ""gameshow"" ever written, it's boring AF and makes no sense!? Don't waste your time folks"
tt9196244,This is such a bad show. It's not even entertaining. Don't waste your time.
tt9196244,"I'm not sure why all the hate. This game show is miles better than anything on network tv. It's not trying to be smart or anything, just silly nonsense."
tt9196244,"Awful garbage. Don't waste your time.About 80% of the content comprises of the presenters' overblown faux-reactions, performative shock/disgust and splitting their sides with laughter at the slightest hint of something which might be potentially amusing to someone.The show seems like it was probably intended for children, but because of the element of risk they decided to retain the content but switch the demographic. Overall found myself becoming irrationally irritated."
tt9196244,"I've always had a theory that Netflix makes shows for stoners and this show confirms that.Get baked, watch this and laugh a bit. Stop yer moanin'."
tt9196244,I enjoyed it but I thought that they repeated a lot of challenges too much. More diversity and different challenges would of made it better. Hoping for a season 2!
tt9196244,"Just threw it on on a whim because I was in a silly mood. The first episode made me laugh. The second, not so much. Then I started the third episode. I say started because it began to grate on me. Got 8 minutes in and knocked it off. Verdict: Rubbish."
tt9196244,This show is reminiscent of old MTV shows such as Room Raiders or Parental Control. The problem is that it is terrible. If the actors tried any harder to fake what they were doing their noses might hit the camera. I'm not sure what Netflix is trying to accomplish with this one but my Lord they really just missed the mark. Don't give it a try it's terrible.
tt9196244,Netflix is clearly just buying for the purposes of bragging about quantity. Who are they even trying to appeal to with this?
tt9196244,I feel bad for anyone and everyone who participated in this. The actual was....alright....I guess...but the MUSIC and the editing made it SUUUUUPERR awkward and cringey.
tt9196244,You're not supposed to flinch yet everyone flinches even tho they know what's coming gtfoh .. not funny or entertaining just stupid and not plausible
tt9196244,"It's a ""free"" show. There's much else to choose from on Netflix. You have a good range of quirky personalities and random challenges. It's short and to the point. Laugh at their reactions and random expressions. Just have it on in the background or drink some beers.It's not high culture. Chill."
tt9196244,"Don't even bother! :(What a waste of time, money, and energy.Netflix what you playing at?"
tt9196244,I love this show. Very simple but entertaining. Cant stop laughing. The challenges are very creative. Love itt
tt9196244,"The show is complete ridiculousness, it's like watching a bunch of drunk bored college kids.... however it is extremely entertaining when you have a few drinks yourself and in all honestly when our world is so full of seriousness this is a delightful break and a chance to just laugh at the utter ridiculousness of it all."
tt9196244,"Totally get this this is just dumb silliness. But damn, they don't even abide by their own rules to the game so they just essentially torture people for fun.
It's like a group of friends found a random barn and thought it'd be a great idea to host a dumb game show with no value and think of ways to make people the most uncomfortable.
Lame"
tt9196244,"You start with three ""hosts"" who just suck the fun out of any situation (especially Desiree), they add nothing to the show. The challenges are interesting for sure, but the god damn editing makes the show seem entirely scripted and fake. Half the time you can't tell whats even going on because of it. Very lame show, don't waste your time"
tt9196244,"I don't know what was worse, watching this pile of garbage or the realisation that my subscription money paid for this abomination."
tt10120734,"This is a TV show of a group of spoiled millennials with money and ""champagne problems"".It's the first time that I'm writing a review on here, but I felt like I needed to.I'm ashamed that my country makes TV Shows like this. The plot is so boring and predictable. The characters are the WORST. And it's so unreal... like, being a millennial myself, I can't believe that these five idiots DON'T WORK OR STUDY AT ALL, have a lot of money and live in super EXPENSIVE buildings. I understand that their fathers gave them money, but that's the reality of a few people in this city, not ALL the millennials.And I hate that everyone on this show is unfaithful, liar and bad people except for the guy with anxiety (sorry I don't remember his name).THERE IS NOT A SINGLE CHARACTER THAT I LIKED IN THE FIVE EPISODES THAT I SAW.Nicolas Riera's character is SO HATEFUL, like, I don't know if it was on purpose but I hate him so much and I'm SO not going to watch the full show to see if he changes.One star for this show."
tt10120734,"The plot is so boring and predictable. The characters are the WORST. And it's so unreal... like, being a millennial myself, I can't believe that these five idiots DON'T WORK OR STUDY AT ALL, have a lot of money and live in super EXPENSIVE buildings .It was a good show until they split up benja and ariana up and put her with juanma was a good story i give it a no star review. If i cold give it a zero i would, the show was awful everyone cheating on everyone. I think ariana could have done better then janma and benji . Why keep it in the group.to me i think the ending was stupid because she might e pregnant but they both could cheat since both are cheaters.everyone ccheats on eeryone , ariana shouldd hae been ppairedd up with someone out of the office i mean shes pregnant by one of them and to me if the show still went on juanma would hae cheated on her or she o the saame caauuse once a cheater always a cheater!! Wish for once they put good love stories on instead of these stupid ones."
tt10120734,"I was looking for something watch over my break and I'm hooked!! I didn't even realize this was a Spanish show when I came across it, but lucky for me I love foreign shows! It makes me laugh and I got hooked to the characters very easily. In some ways it's predictable, but there are times when I never saw a scene coming. I'm 21 and I think it's a good show for people around my age and older. The acting is actually really good too(especially the actor who plays Juanma, when he cries I want to cry). I think it's worth the watch!!"
tt12882136,Too much talk and unnecessary conflicts between agents
tt12882136,"I came here to write a negative review, but it has been already done.
Bad very bad....
Bro culture, nothing interesting, no hustling"
tt12882136,"To sum up the experience of watching this show, it's painful. First, why is this a show with this particular cast? Second, who would work with these hideously unprofessional and immature agents? Third, this show should not be renewed because it just plain sucks."
tt12882136,"I love the Million Dollar Listing shows and was hoping this would be just as good. It's not. Within minutes you realise Michael is the token arrogant idiot. His analogy in the second episode about ""push presents"" made my eyes roll back so far in my head I finally saw what my arse looks like. This show has a little real estate and a lot of wannabe actors sitting around talking. I actually laughed when one said he was looking at cracking a total of a million dollars in commissions this year. Compared to the guys in MDLNY and MDLLA, that's chicken feed. These people are boring and halfway thru the second ep nobody has sold a property yet. Watch it if you need to get rid of annoying guests, this will bore them enough to leave.
We watched the whole season, just to see if anybody sold a property. So here's a few tips:
* Have a shot every time Michael mentions (out of context) that he's about to have a baby
* Have a shot every time Michael says "" Nip it in the butt"". (Nope not a typo, the man is an idiot.
Make a mental note to never take life advice from Michael, because he's great at using sayings that are completely wrong. He uses big words that he clearly doesn't understand their actual meaning.This show sucks and the only reason I gave it a two, is I enjoy looking at real estate."
tt12882136,"Don't waste your time with this show. The real estate agents, home sellers & buyers are all rich snobs. It's so hard to listen to these people."
tt12882136,"Peggy sucks, Michael sucks and Noel sucks. Interior designers suck, potential buyers suck and the sellers suck. Turn the cameras off, no one wants new episodes of this mess"
tt12882136,"Who hires these people! This isn't even about real estate it's about drama amongst immature co workers. Ep1 they claim to be a team who helps each other through sales then they all talk smack about each other's work ethic.Peggy and Michael drive me up the wall they are self-centered children. Everyones unprofessional, one of the interior designers literally jumped on a bed. Not sure how this show get made or how the brokers are successful."
tt12882136,"I really hoped that watching this show would inspire me to do something (not sure what) But instead, it took me to a next level low. The cast is just blatantly dumb. They are for sure not real estate agents. Even a real estate agent for a 100,000 house does a way better job than these idiots. Please do not waste your time here."
tt12882136,"So just starting with the obvious; this is a reality show that follows a group of realtors who work with really, really expensive homes in the Hamptons. A single commission on one of these homes is probably many times your annual salary, so needless to say it's an incredibly competitive field where realtors might spend tens of thousands staging a home to appeal to a particular type of buyer like ""Wall Street financier"" or ""tech geek"" and showing a home might involve throwing a beach party so that perspective buyers can see what it would be like if it was their house.Fair warning, this gets a little long and rambling, so just jump to the last paragraph for the tl;dr.According to the show, 80% of the homes in these high end markets are basically vacation homes for one percenters, so the home owners tend to be of a type. Wealthy, of course, but also used to being catered to and pampered. Polite, but in that polite society 'I'm going to smile to your face and talk about you behind our back' kind of way. Basically your stereotypical entitled rich person.The realtors on the other hand, they're....well, they're just the worst. Being entitled is the natural state of being for rich people, but the realtors aren't rich, just wannabe rich. But dealing closely with wealth and privilege can cause those who wish they were wealthy and privileged to act as though it's all but a done deal that they will be themselves soon enough. They've met rich people and realized that rich people are just plain old humans; they compare those people with themselves and figure 'hey, why not me; I'm just as good looking and smart' and so on. Before you know it someone who barely graduated from high school will happily lecture others on, say, investment strategy, with supreme confidence.There are, however, some interesting moments in the show. Beyond just the house porn, that is. One thing that you get to observe is how high-value properties are sold. Beyond a certain price, the value of an extremely high-end home is open to a certain amount of interpretation. Traditional real estate uses ""comps"", or comparables, to set a value range for a property. Age of the building, acreage, square feet, construction quality and material, etc. But that generally works because you can find other properties with similar qualities and observe what they sold for. With luxury properties it's not as easy because there isn't an agreed upon list of features with known values. What's the value of being on the beach? How about an amazing view? Or a unique architectural design?This comes up in an episode where a home is being listed for $35 million. As is common in these kind of markets, realtors at the firm will help close a coworkers listing by reaching out to their contacts to see if they know a potential buyer. If their contact buys the building, they have some agreed upon split of the commission between the listing agent and the buyer's agent. But it's a little more complicated than just closing a sale. A realtor acting as the seller's agent has a little pull in swaying the home owner towards a bid, but they also have their reputation at stake. Push a seller towards a bad offer to make a sale and it might work or it might anger the seller, who stops seeing the realtor as ""on their side"". This is of particular value in the insular world of people who own multi-million dollar homes.In the episode, one of the realtors is the listing agent for the $35 million home, a home he helped the owners purchase a few years back. One of the other realtors wants to bring in one of her contacts to get a walk through. It turns out her contact is a young man who himself represents a range of clients. However, she's picking at the price even before her contact has seen it. And sure enough, her contact also comes in with the intention of picking away at the price by ""neg-ing"".Neg-ing is where the intermediary comes in and looks for problems or reasons why the property isn't that great with an overall goal of lowering the price, usually because the intermediary gets paid by saving their client money. This is a bit of a judgement call because wealthy buyers do often have representatives that check certain details, but one of the classic neg-ing hallmarks is asking insanely detailed questions that have less to do with checking the quality of the building than they do with developing a list of all the supposedly important features the property doesn't have to use as part of your argument when you start negotiating on price.In the episode the intermediary asks whether the headboard on the bed has charging jacks built into it, implying that newer headboards often do. Just try to imagine, if you will, a buyer looking for a home in the $30 million+ range, and try to estimate how the charging jacks in the headboard will factor in importance to their purchasing decision. It's all a trick anyway; if the headboard had had jacks he would have said something about how most wealthy home owners wouldn't want the fine woodwork of the headboard marred by cheap phone jacks.The episode presents the listing agent realtor as being in the wrong because he's kind of pompous (because he's the worst) in his interactions with the other realtors contact. But I suspect his attitude stemmed from the fact that his instincts were telling him something was off when she started picking so aggressively at the price. In truth, I rather suspect that the realtor for the neg-ing guy likely only uses this contact for when she's not the listing agent or she believes the seller won't give her any repeat business (estate sale, etc.) because she's also the worst. She doesn't care if the other realtor damages his relationship with the homeowners, and neither, frankly, does the real estate agency, since they can just replace him if his contacts run dry. Just a little tip if you are ever selling your home; unless you have to sell quickly for some reason it's usually financially better for you to leave a home on the market a little longer than to accept a low-ball offer, even if your agent is pressuring you to accept the offer. Statistics show that realtors selling their own homes tend to leave them on the market a couple months longer and get something like an average of $10000 more (according to Steven Levitt, I believe).Bottom line, you probably won't identify very well with the people on the show unless you happen to be someone in the privileged position of being able to purchase one of these homes. If that's the case then congratulations and if you've enjoyed this review I'd really love to use your vacation home during the off season if you're just leaving it to sit around empty. Otherwise prepare yourself for a lot of very privileged people who don't think they're privileged, even as they shop for multi-million dollar homes they will use for something like four weeks out of the year. The homes are gorgeous because of course they are, truly top notch real estate porn, but it's cheap enough to watch and dream."
tt12882136,"I actually couldn't even finish the series, the cast annoyed me too much. It was like watching a little group of Highschoolers. I don't doubt they are great people but they are not cut out to be on a show, let a alone be selling multimillion dollar homes in the Hampton's. I thought everyone was unprofessional and I hope they watch themselves and realize they messed up their personal reputations. When I buy a house in the hamptons I will definitely not be calling them up."
tt12882136,"Noelle was unprofessional and incompetent, you can't possibly argue about that. Pointing out that he is black on the other hand and them calling the whole show racist; that kind of IS racist! Remember the Martin Luther King Quote: ""I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character."""
tt12882136,"Interesting watch, though I'm here for the homes even how the realtors interact amongst themselves is entertaining.Unfortunately whenever Peggy is on camera the show instantly turns into a bad reality show. Even more unfortunately the show casts the one person of color as the bad guy (which he wasn't at all). Totally unprofessional behavior by Peggy."
tt12882136,"Homeowners in the Hamptons will run to other real estate brokerages after watching these unprofessional realtors with unappealing, self-serving dramatic muck. Lack of leadership fuels the never ending chaos and dilutes the credibility of Nest Seekers. What a shame because the homes are beautiful and enticing."
tt12882136,"This show has the worst cast. Almost everyone is new to real estate and is trying to sell multimillion dollar properties. No professional Realtor would make such idiotic mistakes. If you're dumb, at least be entertaining. The one guy can't even commit to a pronunciation of his own name. It is so boring - the equivalent of watching Mike Pence eat a mayo sandwich."
tt12882136,"Dreadful show focusing on a bunch of under-achieving social misfits. They have the charm and personality of spoiled, self-centred egomaniacs. They seem to know nothing about pricing or selling property and you really feel for the owners and buyers who are forced to deal with these dregs of society."
tt12882136,"This is very very poor. We just finished 3 enjoyable seasons of selling sunset so decided to give this a go. Its like ""the apprentice"" no experienced 30 somethings chancing their arm. Absolutely terrible. Turned off half way tru ep2. Rubbish."
tt12882136,I've hurt my thumb fast forwarding through this crap. I keep shaking my head and simulating sickness - and I live alone. I thought Noel was okay until he set the price of a house at 35 million - probably 30 million too much. The egos on these dudes is massive - what a mob of wankers. I'm interested in houses - not the lives of the turkeys who are trying to sell them. Sex doggie style in Episode 1. really?Do real estate agents really kiss that much?
tt12882136,"This is nothing but a show of people acting like they are still in high school. Back stabbing, two-faced, people who are so insecure about themselves they try to control everything. My opinion is, they all need to grow up a lot more. Most people can see right through the front and that will never gain a buyer's or seller's trust."
tt12882136,"This is not a show focusing on the properties or giving any real information about the beach homes being sold in the Hamptons. Instead it focuses heavily on the reality show drama among the team of four 30 somethings who haven't been in the game long enough or learned the trade well enough to sell homes at these price points. These guys were definitely not ready to venture out on their own and really should have been interning for someone with experience so they could learn the trade. The team consists of:J. B. - A relatively uninteresting guy who is going through a mid-life crisis at 29 apparently? I guess his eggs are drying up.Mike - A guy with the voice and cartoonish personality of Kevin from The League who is stressing about how he's going to afford the gold plated diapers he seems to think his baby will need. Remember when Kanye said he needed to start making a ton more money when Kim was pregnant with their first child? It's an average Joe version of that.Peggy - A woman who reams Noel out for nearly losing her a potential client, then immediately starts trash talking him to his client because it's only Noel who needs to be professional apparently.Noel - A guy with all the attitude and zero ability to accept any input from people who obviously know more than him, including the buyers.Oh and some baby-faced guy named Jimmy shows up periodically to brag about all the sales he's been making.While there is some light drama to be had, it is disappointing that such lovely homes aren't being showcased to their fullest potential and we're not getting a true look at the tricks and trades of the Hampton beach house real estate market."
tt12882136,"First off, the broker pictured is NOT JOEL Roberts, he's NOEL Roberts (from Nest Seekers) Second, the title is actually a misnomer. You can't find a million dollar beach house in the Hamptons. They start at SEVERAL million dollars, especially if they are right on the beach, regardless of which (Hamptons) town it is. Brokers complain they ""work hard"". Uh...no... hard work is painting a house 20 feet up on a ladder in 90 degree temps. It is NOT hard work going to beautiful locations showing potential buyers breathtaking homes.
The saving grace to this program? Viewing those exclusive properties ...
they are magnificent!"
tt12882136,What a bunch of insufferable immature man babies. This show is almost unwatchable.
tt12882136,I love the show and the cast! Can't wait for more episodes.
tt12882136,"This show features incredibly trashy thirtysomethings working in an industry - luxury real estate - that they clearly don't understand. This is not going to bode well for their brokerage. The entire productions comes across like a satirical trailer park version of ""Selling Sunset"" that was accidentally filmed in the Hamptons."
tt13018090,Please stop producing so much TV Shows in such low quality! We would rather have less quantity but better quality for the time and money we spend!
tt13018090,"This is terrible? I've watched most of Netflix's sitcoms, While not all of them have worked for me, this is probably the worst of the lot, I enjoyed the Big Show Show better than this."
tt13018090,"Dear, oh dear, oh dear...Formulaic, telegraphed 'jokes'. Stereo types a plenty. Breaking the 4th wall just to explain the jokes to us 'normal' people.You might hope it gets better once the characters are bedded in, it doesn't.Jamie Foxx wants to be portrayed as an irresistible stud, but fails. End of."
tt13018090,"This is the only question that comes to mind while watching this terrible attempt at comedy. I love Jamie Foxx, but wtf was he thinking with this?! It's really bad, I couldn't make it through the first episode. Very outdated humour, not funny at all and terrible terrible acting! Avoid!"
tt13018090,"I luv Jamie Foxx, and really wanted to like this show.Sadly, it just isn't funny. The 4th wall breaks are contrived and the 'canned' laugh track is irritating.1st rule of comedy? It's gotta be funny. This isn't that.Bad writing, acting, directing as well.Skip this and watch anything else. You'll thank me...."
tt13018090,"Full disclosure: I only watched the first episode and for that alone I feel like I deserve an award.It was the saddest, unfunny 25 minutes of my life and I've seen Pootie Tang. This would not have made it to pilot in the 90's let alone 2021. I get it - if Jamie Foxx did this purely to give his daughter's career a push then fine. But why did it have to be a humorless bore?Hopefully, Corrine Foxx learnt a few things here as writer/executive producer and I wish her nothing but success.However, I don't know which hurt more - the disappointment of an unfunny Jamie Foxx sitcom or the fact I missed an opportunity for a power nap."
tt13018090,"This is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. I didn't even smile, let alone laugh. Netflix has a lot of money. They throw cash around wherever they feel like wasting it. I have no idea how this show got greenlit. I could only stomach 1 episode. Don't waste your time, people."
tt13018090,Not funny.. Bad acting.. I finished the whole season but I got bored in the first episode..
tt13018090,I didn't find the show extremely bad. Corny? Yes! But I did laugh. The laughter soundtrack is very annoying but all in all it was entertaining to me.
tt13018090,"This is gotta be the worst show I've seen in ten years , Jamie fox is stuck in the 90s with this show and cast, weak storyline and horrible acting."
tt13018090,"The scenes with Jamie foxx are great. It has its super hilarious moments and slow/corny scenes but overall a good show, especially if your a dad."
tt13018090,It's a show to turn off your brain and relax and you'll have a ball. Don't treat it too seriously because it's impossible but if You watch it just for fun you'll have a ball. Jamie's impressions are enough to make you laugh.
tt13018090,"The writing is awful and not at all funny. The jokes, if we dare call them that, are flat or simply nonexistent. The fact that Jamie Foxx and David Alan Grier started their respective careers in comedy and are apart of this is just a travesty. Both men are very talented and were some of the funniest cast members on In Living Color. The initial idea had a crumb of potential, but the execution has proven to be absolutely horrendous."
tt13018090,I'm embarrassed for the entire cast. This show is awful. I give it 5 ears of corn because stars are just not appropriate for this caca. 🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽
tt13018090,"Did not expect much just a few laughs and a casual sitcom to binge, well was i wrong!!!Cringeworthy scenes and jamie fox thinking everything i do is funny, well hate to break the news to you jamie you aint funny!Does no one of the crew ore production team say after making one episode ""guys this is bad really bad we have to change the script"" i guess not!Well there were a lot of fake laughs during the making of this show i can guarantee that!Little more control over your projects is hard needed netflix.Do not waste your time on this, i would recomment the really funny show gentefied."
tt13018090,"I don't know if Netflix needed to fill slots or just wanted Jamie Foxx to be happy. Don't get me wrong.. I love Jamie Foxx and all his work, but this just wasn't it. It's something to put on to fall asleep to or just have some noise in the background while on zoom. Love the casting but it just falls flatter than most reboots."
tt13018090,Not funny. The show is obnoxious and crass. I'm sorry I wasted 15 minutes of my life on it.
tt13018090,Enjoyable sitcoms are when they are able to create emotional attachment with the audience the first or second episode. There was hardly any creativity or interesting backstory build up. Enforced negative stereotypes about the black community. Disappointed because there were amazing actors in the cast.
tt13018090,"In my personal opinion as some had mentioned that 4th wall breaking was annoying and unnecessary. I cringed at the title of the show but still thought it had potential. I think the whole show tried to focus way too much on the father/daughter relationship from the beginning and it would have been nice to develop the characters a little more first. As a person that has lived with 7 people in one house, there was too much gathering going on that wouldn't happen in real life. I enjoyed the character playing the aunt. I don't enjoy the cop character as they tried too hard to make him look weak from the beginning. I hope they change the name of the show and its tough making a show featuring a minor but hopefully the ""child"" character can come back older and the show can have more adult jokes to play with."
tt13018090,"This show tried too hard to be funny and missed the point completely. I love Jamie but this show is a NO. David Allen Grier is one of the funniest black men in Hollywood and even his excellence couldn't save this train wreck of a show. The references to popular culture are appreciated but Netflix should NOT have picked this up, 'the single black dad raising a child with a mother who has passed away' thing is overly done now (Keenan). Cancel this show, go back to the sitcoms drawing board and give us something else that will be enjoyable."
tt13018090,"Congrats Jamie Foxx and Jim Patterson.✌
The pilot episode was a bit off, but they really picked it up from the 2nd episode onwards. I enjoyed it because its light, funny, and approachable to social matters that happen in real life and to real ppl with a zest of comedy.Hoping to see a season 2. And please do not compare it to other sitcoms because each should stand on its own with its own storyline."
tt13018090,"The show has a lot of potential.I am a masssive Jamie foxx fan and often enjoy his funny moments . And there is quiet a few, on the other hand there it is quite repetitive."
tt13018090,Ok i stareted watching 2ep after 1st ... i said i give it a go.... but this was such a waste of time...Jamie i know your doughter produce this but still.... not worth your acting...one of the worst comedy series i ever seen.... acting i barley mediocre.
tt13018090,I rated this a 2 only because of David Alan Grier because he's really a very good actor and deserves a better show than this. This show is not the opportunity he had hoped it would be. I watched a backstory interview about this show between David A Grier and Jamie Foxx. Mr Grier was so hopeful about working with Mr Foxx but this is not good.
tt13018090,"The only reason you found this show on Netflix is coz you wanted something better to do instead of taking a nap.... take it, take that power nap!"
tt0370032,"Ultraviolet was embarrassingly terrible on so many levels. My husband and I usually really dig the comic book and action movies, so I think that our expectations were reasonable for the genre. The kinds of movies that Ultraviolet tried to channel were X-Men, The Matrix and Underworld. Unfortunately, this movie failed to do so.1) Dialogue was laughably bad. One of Milla's lines was actually ""Because these beautiful moments turn evil when they're over."" What?? This was regarding a romantic pass made at her. Totally incongruous with the setting. 2) Excessive use of CGI is a personal irritant. Additionally, the motorcycle chase scenes were only one step above TRON. I might as well have been watching my 11 year old neighbors play some video game. 3) Zero character development. I didn't care about Violet, the french guy, the scientist guy, the pretty boy, or the evil nose filter guy. I didn't care about their individual goals (mainly because they weren't very clear). I didn't care about characters dying, and I didn't care about the revelation at the end; the only indicator that I had that it was important was her somewhat awed reaction.To be fair, Milla Jovovich has an incredible face and body and is well-suited for fight scenes. If all-CGI, all-the-time is your thing, then you'll be thrilled with the loads of glossed-over fight scenes involving Milla and hordes of green screen baddies. If you're like our entire theater, you're bored. Really, fake fights just don't impress me."
tt0370032,"Kurt Wimmer who wrote and directed Equilibrium, which imho is a great movie, failed miserably to repeat his former success. The idea's behind the movie had visible potential but unfortunately the execution was extremely poor. Bad acting, a confusing and altogether nonsensical story line, and most of all bad writing really killed this one for me. This movie seemed more like a commercial for CGI than anything else. The CGI however was excellent (except for the last scene, I guess they ran out of money)and probably the most interesting part of the movie. The action which is why I saw the movie suffered from repetition: from the characters, to the setups (Violet is being attacked when she is out-numbered), to the moves, unnecessary sword fighting when they have guns with bullets, unnecessarily repetitive situations (big circle everyone attacks at once and violet wins with ease no challenging battle), and a lack of depth. Kurt really missed the mark, better luck next time."
tt0370032,"It is a little difficult to imagine why this film was released in its current form. It has some potential, the action sequences look a little mundane as we have seen it all before but they are quick and effective. The story is quirky enough to be interesting and some of the backdrops look good.The problem is, Ultraviolet neither makes sense nor holds together as a film. Huge chunks of action and story seem to have been lost on the cutting room floor. The film is left overloaded with the expensive bits that had already been paid for. Lots of sweeping city-scapes and shots of Mila walking down corridors don't make a film.It reminds me of other Japanese live action Manga smash-ups (See Kasshern etc). The problem is that Japanese films have every right not to make sense and be completely over the top, as it is what they do best. Unfortunately, due to a westernised need for slight reality, Hollywood have attempted same thing and ended up with a cheap looking film with a poor script stuck together with a bunch of crap one liners."
tt0370032,"This movie is absolutely horrible. The magnitude of its suck is unbelievable. The characters in the movie are very poorly developed so when you are quickly put into a silent emotional scene, you're left unaffected. The movie takes place in the future so they add in all kinda of high-tech gadgets that are so stupidly unrealistic it makes you laugh. They try to incorporate unbelievable advanced technology with a more modern day looking setting so the two aspects clash. They can make weapons materialize in their hands but their form of infection control is still rubber gloves. The plot itself is kind of hard to follow and doesn't seem to make any sense at times. How vampires fit into the movie, i have no idea.I signed up to IMDb for the sole purpose of warning anyone who wants to see this movie. This movie was horrible and do not waste a dime on this movie. The only delight i got from this movie is watching the fine Milia Jovovich dance around in skin tight outfits. I cannot stress how awful this movie is. Don't waste your time or money on this film!"
tt0370032,"Personally, I love Milla. Even in this, she's still Milla. She's hot, she's fit and she handles the 'tough' role well. I hold the director responsible for bringing it all together. Personally, I didn't 'dislike' this movie. It reminds me of Doom. With the right budget, the right director and time, it could have been the best film of the year. Otherwise, it will leave you feeling like something's been left out. What I liked was the fact I went for a cheesy, mass-action, campy, comic-book/video game movie. I expected fighting, explosions, gratuitous scenes with some nudity and a minimal plot. No, this isn't plot intensive like Silent Hill. (Again, an underlying feature that could have been better handled). So, if you're like me, and you enjoy seeing Milla do her thang, faceless soldiers being under mass slaughter and needless, gratuitous violence, then this is the film for you. Of course, I look for this type of movie only once per year. Just as a break from everything else. The quota has been filled!"
tt0370032,"I had hopes for this movie based on the trailer, but it turned out to be one of the worst I've ever seen.The special effects range from mediocre to kinda cool, but the plot is too sketchy and absurd to justify their existence. Milla Jovovich's hair and jacket change colors for no discernible reason throughout the film. I think the pretty colors are supposed to distract us from the incoherent script, but it doesn't work. The Sky Captain-style post-processing just makes everything look blurry. (And why is it applied to only half the shots?) Just about everything in this movie is borrowed from something else, and it's slapped together on the thinnest of premises and tarted up with lots of CGI. When there's a break from the ridiculously-choreographed action sequences, the audience is bludgeoned with nonsensical subplots and indescribably awful dialogue. By the time the heroine met the villain in their final showdown, the audience in my theater was laughing out loud.If you appreciate Milla Jovovich's body, it might be possible to enjoy this film by renting the DVD and watching it with the sound off and your techno MP3 collection blaring in the background while you do something productive, like picking the gunk out from beneath your toenails. Or you could spare yourself the pain and just get The Fifth Element instead."
tt0370032,"In the future research into a rare blood anomaly has gotten out of control, making it more infectious and deadly than nature ever did. It spreads. The world become split between the uninfected humans and those infected who have developed the traits of the vampires of old. Known as Hemophages, they fight back in a war led by Daxus as head of the new totalitarian world. In the middle of this war is Violet, a Hemophage whose infection lost her child. Violet steals a secret weapon from Daxus to return to her people. However when the weapon turns out to be a human child with a mutation in his blood Violet hesitates. She goes on the run with the child but both sides seem determined to kill her and her ward.This film got roundly harsh reviews when it came out in cinemas and it maintains an equally low rating on IMDb but, arrogant as I am, I thought it might be a piece of mindless fun. Well, I'm sad to say that my hope proved to have no founding in reality. It isn't that the film is really bad, because it isn't. It is more than it doesn't really follow through on anything or do anything that well and the result is a rather messy and inconsequential film that I really struggled to feel anything strong about whatsoever  not a sense of fun, excitement, interesting or even hate.The plot is the first obstacle to get over as it exists in a world that, as Violet first says, is hard to understand. On the surface it is a typical totalitarian state with disease and war at its core and thus surely would offer some potential for commentary on our modern society (OK maybe not V for Vendetta but perhaps something). Sadly no, nothing like that is to be found and instead the world is one of assumptions and half-baked ideas from other sources. This is a minor problem compared to my main issue with it though. Others have picked holes in the specifics but for me it all falls over because it simply takes itself too seriously. On one hand it is a comic book movie with excessive action and loads of (rather obvious) CGI but on the other we get loads of heavy moments that just clunk their way across the screen.It could have gone either way and have been better for it. It could have been more fun and a bit less full of itself  embracing the comic book style and making the CGI look part of the ""unreal"" effect rather than leaving them to stand out by looking a bit cheap, like they couldn't match everything else due to budget constraints. Conversely it could have gone more adult, properly explored the maternal theme and developed the characters beyond the one dimensional but then I guess that would have risked the teen action crowd. However by trying to do neither and both at the same time the end result is a bit messy. I could go on but I'll leave others to tell you about the clunky script, roundly flat acting and disjointed story but suffice to say they are correct  nothing is really done well here.Even the action, which surprised me. Some scenes offer excitement but mostly they are all overdone and full of too many baddies and an inability to keep the camera still for longer than a second to let us enjoy what we are seeing or feel close to it. The one scene I did think was well done was the conclusion; not brilliant because it still suffered from excess but the darkness and the 1-on-1 (as opposed to 700-on-1) did at least make me get into it a bit. Jovovich has a good body and is not a ""bad"" actress here but really she does offer little more than the basics. Any vague attempt she does make to find the person in her character is either misjudged or ignored and all we are left with is the sight of her in tight clothes killing people while looking sexy; perfect for the teenage boy market but those days are a decade or so behind me and I just felt bored. Bright is dull while I can only assume that Fichtner hoped for a franchise and took a role that would potentially give him an expansion potential in later films (yeah William, drop me a line and let me know how that's working out for ya). Chinlund at least has the good taste to furiously ham it up; maybe it is because he is a ham or maybe it was a decision but either way at least he has a bit of fun and his character never gets sucked into being dry and serious like the rest of the film (he's still not great though).Overall, not as bad as some would have you believe but certainly no earthly good either. The approach is mixed and mostly fails to inspire, excite, engage or even interest. I would have liked to see it try to do something in particular  be silly, be clever, be childish, be adult  something. Hell, I might even have liked it if it had been such a shambles that it became fun to mock. As it is though it is just totally mediocre, boring, flat and uninspiring. Even teenage boys deserve better."
tt0370032,"Well I have officially wasted 88mins of my life on a movie. I have always been open minded to movies. Some have bad acting, errors... etc. I try to put myself into the mind of a lead character and live the movie, turning my mind off to enjoy what's on the screen. I sat down with my popcorn to enjoy a movie that I could care if it had a plot. I was in a mood to see action. Well...... I can't even say I was impressed with even that. This movie had the entire theatre sitting there with a deer in the headlights expression and we all were thinking WTF???? Those that I did know there said they couldn't leave because, like me, they thought it had to get better... We were wrong. I would love to be vindictive and tell everyone to go see this movie. I wasted my money and time... why should I be alone in that. Truthfully, I can't be that mean to even my most hated enemy. If you are going for any reason... at least Milla looks good in her outfits, and the outfits are cool."
tt0370032,"I registered at this site just to tell you how GODAWFUL this movie truly is. About 10 minutes into the movie I started praying for a brain tumor to arrive and kill me. Let me break this down for you.Plot: There is none really. Violet has some kind of ultra-contagious plague that the government is trying to eliminate. Even though it's so contagious that BREATHING THE SAME AIR can infect you. So half the people run around with gas masks. The lead ""bad guy"" is so obsessive that he buys his GUNS in sealed plastic bags. Which just makes NO sense when you get to the end of the movie. At one point there is a 10 minute (or less) love interest between Violet and some random vampire. No character development, so don't worry about paying attention. Did I mention that there seem to be virtually NO bad side effects to this ""plague""? You become super strong, super fast, and super pretty much everything. There are vague references in the movie about Violet ""dying"" but this isn't really adequately explained so I'm gonna assume since she never DOES die (unfortunately), that it can't be that hard to avoid. They keep using ""holograms"" as an excuse to build false suspense...but nobody really cares because the movie is just such a pile of crap that I was just blankly staring at the screen at this point.Graphics: sub par and over hyped. As an example: For some reason these ""vampires"" who are being hunted to the brink of extinction buy a belt that has a SUN trapped inside it for fusion power...this somehow lets violet drive her motorcycle sideways across a building while being shot at by a helicopter (something about gravity powers). She kills the two pilots and this is apparently enough to make the helicopter explode. The whole time I was watching this, I was bored. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN? The graphics are SO cheesy that you simply cannot suspend your disbelief. Parts of it just look like a violent Toy Story. Not that I dislike Toy Story, but the point is, the CGI graphics in it should NOT be combined with live action.I can't go on...this movie was the worst thing I've ever seen.it is worse than Plan 9 from outerspace.For the love of ALL that is holy, do NOT see it."
tt0370032,"After having been given repeated warnings about how bad this film is, I went ahead and watched a borrowed copy. About thirty minutes into the film I had reached a decision: I was enjoying it. While certainly not Oscar-winning material, most people apparently were expecting some kind of cinematic masterpiece rather than what they got, an over-the-top comic book-like action set piece with a modicum of plot to tie together the action sequences.The gunkata sequences, closer to Wimmer's original idea of the form, do not approach the stark and yet orgiastic death-art of Equilibrium, but they're fun all the same. The movie is full of neat, if improbable, gadgetry, from gravity manipulators to disposable paper cell phones. Nick Chinlund chews a satisfactory amount of scenery without stuffing himself down the viewer's throat. Milla Jovovich herself manages to use a two-dimensional role to display probably the most range I've ever seen her give outside of ""The Messenger"", and she was certainly much more attractive in this movie than in any of the others I've ever watched her in. All these things contribute to what amounted to a popcorn bowl of a film: not something you'd eat for every meal, but a nice snack for a change of pace when you don't want something too substantial.The problem seems to be that most people can't just shut off their brains and enjoy a romp once in a while. Would this film ever seriously contend for Best Anything? No. But it certainly does not deserve the almost universal slagging it has gotten since its release. Ignore what you've heard, don't expect too much, and you might just find yourself being entertained for an hour and a half."
tt0370032,"I'm going to go set a camera on record, then throw it into a cement sidewalk. This would result in a film that is 10 times better than Ultraviolet. I honestly cannot recall a worse movie. I would have rather watched care bears with my parents. The film does not seem to contain anything that resembles a storyline. We begin right in a poorly animated action sequence that makes absolutely no sense, then continue watching more poorly animated ridiculous scenes for the next hour and a half. To say the acting was horrible would be an understatement. After hearing the infamous trailer line ""Are you Mental?"", I am also fairly confident the script writer is a five year old with ADD."
tt0370032,"Having watched the regular release version I was somewhat confused as to what was going on, though I was able to surmise the base elements of the plot, but when I saw the uncut version with the scenes left in, things made a lot more sense.The plot seems a bit obscure at first; unless you're sharp, you're not going to be able to follow it. That is all I will say about that.It's true the acting wasn't magnificent but I really don't know what everyone is complaining about. Plenty of action, yes, and Milla Jovovich looks great. I thought it was a pretty good watch myself, and I am in the minority there. I definitely don't think it's a waste of time, though it is a bit dark. It's now in my DVD collection, in fact.Rent it, watch the uncut version. Though not my favourite movie of all time, I enjoyed it."
tt0370032,"Look, let's be serious. The movie is flashy and fantastic, buried in cgi and special effects, and the plot is rather obscure and strange. What makes the movie good is that it does go over the top. This movie dazzles.If Mila catches your eye, this movie may be the finest piece that she did around this time. So beautiful."
tt0370032,"The opening few minutes of Kurt Wimmer's Ultraviolet is a rip roaring, pulse pounding set up of action sequences and chases. Then the film calms down for a little breather until the next amazing fight sequence. Following a holocaust some humans have become Hemophages, a sub-species with enhanced physical abilities. Violet, must protect a nine-year-old boy who has been marked for death by the human government.In the wake of 2005's disappointing Aeon Flux, underrated Kurt Wimmer director of Equilibrium (2002) writer of The Recruit (2003) and Salt (2010) set about creating an up-to-the-minute Sci-fi.However, after shooting wrapped Kurt left after being pressured to deliver less emotional PG-13 rated film. In turn, Ultraviolet was completely re-edited by the studio and apparently this marred the finished product significantly.Acting wise, William Fichtner puts in an unusual performance, Sebastien Andrieu and Nick Chinlund both seem unsure what's going on. With an abundance of forgettable bad guys, Milla Jovovich excellently plays Violet who has enhanced speed, incredible stamina and acute intelligence. Her character at first seems very one dimensional as she plays her usual Resident Evil kick-ass self. But even in the short running time her character develops, you're given glimpses into here past, as she bonds with 'Six' played well by Cameron Bright.There's great effects, stunts and a thumping score. A lot of reviews have criticised the CGI usage, however, it's stylised, hyper-real and sleek. It's not meant to be faithful representation of a real world. Holograms, swords, a new invented language, gun-fighting and martial arts. It's science fiction entertainment, set in the 21st century, nothing more, nothing less.It's fast, it's fun - Ultraviolet is an pleasing sci-fi action but possibly could have been so much more if Wimmer was allowed to deliver his cut."
tt0370032,"The idea behind a good Sci-fi movie is making the improbable seems possible. But often this genre is blight by an amalgamation of poor written scripts, weak plots, laughable acting and over the top stunts that turns fantasy into ridicule. And this is precisely the case with Ultraviolet. At first glance the movie appears to be promising. But fifteen minutes into the movie and one quickly realizes that this is just the beginning of an 88 minute roller-coaster ride of boredom. Without given much away, the movie brings nothing new to the table as far as storyline is concerned. The action sequences are far from entertaining and are an insult to the human intelligence. I'll grantee that you'll get more of a trill watching paint dry than watching this cinematic garbage. If you want to loose eight or ten bucks and maintain a shred of dignity, do what other people do and by lottery tickets."
tt0370032,"In a future totalitarian society, there is a war between humans and the group of beings infected in a government experiment called ""hemophages"", with enhanced strength and abilities. When the warrior Ultraviolet (Milla Jovovich) is assigned to steal a secret weapon capable of destroying the ""hemophages"", she discloses that it is actually a boy called Six (Cameron Bright) that has been genetically modified. The maternal instinct of Ultraviolet arises and she fights against the tyrant Daxus (Nick Chinlund) and her mates leaded by Nerva (Sebastien Andrieu) trying to find an antidote and the cure of Six.""Ultraviolet"" is a deceptive movie for many reasons. The first one certainly is the awful screenplay, with a bad story, silly dialogs and no development of the characters. The excessive use of CGI gives the sensation that the viewer is watching a video game, alternating beautiful colorful sequences with very poor special effects, like for example, the motorcycle sequence, when Ultraviolet is chased. I like movies based on cartoons, but Ultraviolet was a great deception. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Ultravioleta"" (""Ultraviolet"")"
tt0370032,"I had high expectations before going in to see Ultraviolet. I liked similar movies (e.g. Transporter, Underworld, and Resident Evil), even though the acting was often lacking and some action scenes were too unbelievable to be real. That being said, I absolutely detested Ultraviolet for all of its shortcomings. Worth mentioning is that many people in the audience left early into the movie (accurately sensing that the rest was going to be just as bad as what they'd already seen). Here are some good things to be said about Ultraviolet: cool special effects, great scenery, nice weapons, and funky costumes. Here are some not-so-good things to be said about the movie: really bad acting, confusing plot, really cheesy moments at the most awkward times, unbelievable action sequences (even more so than Transporter 2), incoherent screen shot sequences, lame one-liners, and (at times) sappy music. At times, I found myself thinking: does the director really think I'm that stupid? Throughout the movie, people keep asking Violet if she was crazy or ""mental"" for continuing on her violent rampage. Ultimately, I think questions of sanity should be reserved for anyone who goes to see this movie in light of what I and others will no doubt write about it. Trust me on this one: if you find yourself in the theatre watching Ultraviolet, you'll likely be looking at your watch more often than the screen.Save your money and your time."
tt0370032,"The film Ultraviolet is a great premise and has some props here and there but it's a near complete failure of a film. WHY? Because of the studio that green light this movie. Information has been exposed that writer/director Kurt Wimmer's vision of the film was cut by the studio by over 30 minutes, 30 minutes that are actually very important to the story, characters and action. So wait for this film to come out on DVD, because the shorten 88 minute verison of the film will totally disappoint everyone. Give this film a chance, when the director's cut comes out, I will Milla Jovovich was very sexy and bad ass in this film, hopefully she will continue to do such films."
tt0370032,"The worst part about Ultraviolet is that it has THREE genres of movies to compete with. People will compare it to the blockbusters of Sci-Fi movies, Martial Arts movies, and Heroine movies. It will have a tough time trying to stand out when people will inevitably compare it to HUGE movies like Crouching Tiger, The Matrix, Kill Bill, Underworld, etc.Let's remember that Ultraviolet had a relatively small budget, and yet it did quite a bit with it. With all that said, let me say a few words, good and bad ones, on Ultraviolet.Yes, the story in Ultraviolet is its weakest point. The problem is in the lack of emotional attachment to the characters, the odd choice and delivery of lines (although you can't deny how great the ""It is on."" line is), and the strange dream-like stuff it goes into at times.A lot of the themes in this movie are very fleeting, maybe because they've just been done so often, they need no emphasis. There's one particular story element that you might miss ENTIRELY if you didn't pay attention during one shot. That's how little emphasis there is on story in this movie. The plot is also a little hard to follow at times because it jumps around.It's strange to see so little emphasis on the story when we know from Equilibrium that Kurt Wimmer is very capable of writing a good story. It makes me wonder if the lack of story was intentional or not, but the unfortunate bottom line is that it hurts this movie.So what saves this movie? Why 8 out of 10? If we were interested in movies only for their story, we wouldn't be interested in movies at all...we would all read books instead.Yes, a movie is defined as picture and sound. In that case, Ultraviolet is quite an amazingly interesting picture and sound.Ultraviolet sacrifices story for a very visceral picture and oodles of style. I haven't seen a movie that looks this COOL in a long time. It really reminds me of the type of style that 60's sci-fi movies were going for- very robust in color and costumes, but modernized and expanded for our time. It's certainly a very nice departure from the typical and BORING space station/stainless steel/green look of modern sci-fi.The action is kick-ass, applause-worthy at times...although I'll admit that I've seen a bit better from similarly-budgeted movies (""Versus"" comes to mind). They could've had some more variety to it (like maybe some better/badder foes), but considering who and what they were working with, I think they did a good job.Another big strength of the movie is the very cool concepts. Color-changing outfits, gravity belts, disposable paper cellphones, crazy ninjas that drop out of planes like giant pinballs, and entire weapon arsenals stored in wrist devices. All of it with designer-quality fashion to it. You can tell where the budget went in this movie. Like I said, it's an older, weirder, more stylish sense of sci-fi that you don't see very often these days. In fact, a lot of this movie can be defined as set-pieces more so than a single flowing experience.True, their ability to execute some of these ideas (specifically, the motorcycle chase) is limited by their budget. I think it can be overlooked, though. Some rough edges on CG never hurt anybody...anybody that wants to whine about the graphics really doesn't want to appreciate the movie for what it is.Overall, I enjoyed this movie, more so for its visuals, music, concepts and set-pieces than for its story or characters. It's really quite interesting to look at. There are more moments in this movie that make me think 'awesome!' than in all of The Matrix trilogy. If this movie isn't a success, then I hope it at least inspires the movie that does get this particular formula just right."
tt0370032,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.This is certainly something different. It's a different approach to vampires (hemophages), it's a different approach to sci-fi, and it's a different approach to corporate dystopia. Oddly, the Umbrella Corporation from ""Resident Evil"" is the closest of which I can think.Milla Jovovich is entirely capable of performing high action sequences, and carrying the movie, which she does wonderfully. I don't doubt that she has some pull in the production process, but the problems in this are mostly the weak character work and the ""I have this really cool idea I'd like to do on screen, it'll be totally different than anything else out there."" of it all.Some of it (nose plugs) are actively distracting, and other things are just odd choices (squared off sword), while there are cool concepts (dimensionally printed weapons), and scenes that just look cool even if they're not especially practical or sensisble (swords on fire in the dark).My only personal gripes are day walking vampires, weird foley sounds for the guns (most are right, but it is hard to tell on made up guns), and why in the hell people with guns would charge someone instead of firing.I think this movie holds up as good as it did when it was released, and I have a good time re-watching it."
tt0370032,"There is no need to go into detail about how truly bad this ""film"" is, as you can find that in most of the other comments.What I'm curious to find out is did anyone else find that kid EXTREMELY ANNOYING?? Yes, everything else in the film was annoying: nonsensical plot, bad acting, bad SFX, etc.. However, what annoyed me most was that kid with the stupid look on his face all the time! I don't know whether it was his bad acting, the stupid role he had, or just his naturally annoying looks. Am I the only one to think this? Is it unfair to think this? Has anyone else seen him in another film? Was he just as annoying? Although I'd like to, I haven't seen X-Men: The Last Stand yet, but I see that he's in it, and it has kind of put me off...Oh, yes - there should be a negative scoring system available! 1/10 implies that there was AT LEAST something you liked about the film. What if there wasn't?"
tt0383060,"I rented this movie for my cousin, it was his pick and we watched it as soon as we got home, he loved it! I seriously was expecting this big travesty of a film with the way the users are talking about it on IMDb, but I have to honestly say that it wasn't THAT bad, come on, it's a kid's movie, what did you expect? Citizen Kane? For the kids it had a fun plot and cool visuals, yeah, the story was a little lame, but as adults we should know that this movie was not meant for us, so I am going to judge it on being a children's movie.These kids all have super powers, but don't know how to use them effectively, so the program of Zoom is going to help them become super heroes with a man who was a former celebrity type of hero who is now a has-been. They enjoy being kids with each other and learn how to use their powers in the right ways and must destroy Conor, another former super hero who went bad. Together they all must learn to a team and also a family.Like I said, for a kid's movie, it's cute and it really wasn't a BAD movie, I've seen worse, believe me! So don't use most of these comments as your judgment factor, see how the kids react and really judge for yourself, it's a fun little flick that I wouldn't watch again, but I think it will be a fun small classic somewhere down the road for the children.5/10"
tt0383060,The soundtrack having 5 smash mouth songs really fits the tone and overall quality of the movie.
tt0383060,"First off, a tiny bit about me. 1) I took my daughters (13 & 10) to this movie. 2) I tend to enjoy children's movies and I love SciFi. 3) My wife & I mostly agreed about the quality of this movie. 4) I've never rated a movie before.Although I agree with many points from the first posting, I do think this movie *had* promise. It seems to me that if all characters were developed properly, that the screenplay had been more carefully thought out, that the technical filming of the show had gone better (boom mic!), that there was cohesiveness to the whole story, and that the actual plot had been more fully developed that this movie could have been spectacular. I was even willing to accept the story line until the kids were mysteriously found dutifully waiting in their room when they were supposed to be hiding. After that, it went downhill quickly for me.I would have liked to see more exemplary development of the kids' powers -- the kind of foreshadowing that is later revealed in how they save the day (ie. A scene of Summer controlling the paint balls would have helped me believe better her focused power use in the end). Why spend all that time watching Cindy throw ton-weights at a target? How did Dylan's ability with the apple help in the end? What did they do with Tucker to help him learn to control his bloating? How is ""mind sight"" related to invisibility? Don't even get me started on Ms. Cox character (which I thought she played well).The pacing and development of the two predictable romances was fair, but why not let Summer have a little tirade with Dylan for knowing he had ""seen"" her dancing? Followed up with Dylan's peace offering of the necklace pendant -- drama & release -- make the relationship grow on us.The human stories here have to do with the kids as outcasts in life. Let's develop that more than the two short bits about the girls and Jack finally relating to Dylan. Zoom needed to grow with each kid to show his own growth and bring out his determination to succeed.Then again, succeed at what? I think Tim Allen does a great job with the ""unknown"" aspect of the plot. He has no motivation, he gives none. But without a believable reason to drive the plot of the kids' training, we get what we saw. Also, there's nothing socially ""dangerous"" about the threat of Concussion - it seems a personal vendetta or overblown fear that Larraby is concerned about -- hardly enough to make me feel for him or his cause, and, unfortunately, the movie.Finally, let's chew on continuity and technical prowess. I was thinking I saw the boom 5 times (but let's not quibble). Aren't people paid to notice these things (the director, even) during production? Let's keep track of where the characters are and give them a reason to go/be somewhere else. Let's give the characters more reason, heck even a strategy, to want to make and close a vortex. Let's see Rip Torn say the line that we watch him ventriloquize {sic}.Would I watch it again? Maybe just to watch Zoom stumble again, see Houdini throw another punch, or see Summer be radiant -- OK, Cindy's got the tough-cute factor that can be enjoyable in moderation (pull up a chair, whydontya)."
tt0383060,"I have seen a number of movies from Revolution Studios, and with almost all of them I have found them to be souless ""product"" - movies put together with ingredients that seemed to guarantee a big hit, but lacking soul. With movies like this (a box office flop, partly due to the fact it was not screened for critics, a sign audiences know usually means a stinker), it's no wonder that Revolution Studios closed its doors a year later.What went wrong with this movie? The main reasons the movie is a stinker can be traced to the script. We have four youths on the team Allen is leading, and we learn next to nothing about them. They are pretty interchangeable. The rest of the characters are poorly written as well. The bad guy of the movie doesn't appear until the last 15 minutes of the movie, leaving no time to develop him.This poor writing of the characters may explain the awful performances from the adult members of the cast. I agree with the Leonard Maltin movie guide that Allen seems to be phoning it in. He seems to have a contempt for what he is surrounded by, making his character very unlikable. As for Chevy Chase, he doesn't even TRY to be funny.The movie tries to inject emotion by playing popular pop songs on the soundtrack, but it doesn't work. The sets and various indoor and outdoor locations are okay, I guess. But the CGI used is third-rate, giving the movie a cheap look when it occurs. Kids may not mind that. But will they like the rest of the movie? If I saw this as a kid, I probably wouldn't have liked it - the movie lacks spirited characters and a sense of wonder and excitement. There may be some (very) young kinds who might like this movie, but I don't think it will be a movie that they will want to watch again and again."
tt0383060,"The people who rated this movie 1-star should get their heads out of their posteriors. Too many movie-goers these days seem to only see movies as either being the best thing ever or the worst thing ever. The only way a movie should get 10 stars is if it would be difficult to improve upon and the only way a movie should get 1 star is if it was absolutely ineptly made on every level, and I assure you this movie doesn't come close to that. Even solely rating on personal taste and ignoring the technical filmmaking and how successfully the movie achieves the filmmakers' apparent intent, this movie could hardly be in the worst 10% of movies for anyone's taste.This movie fails in many respects, but it has some redeeming moments and taken as a movie for small kids, it's not bad. The humor and acting both fall flat or miss the mark about as often as they're on target, but that is a sign of mediocrity, not atrocity.Unfortunately at this point most of the IMDb users seem to think that if they enjoyed a movie they should give it a 10 and if it wasn't all they hoped for they should give it a 1. For instance the Lord of the Rings movies were entertaining, but have no business being rated higher than Citizen Kane or any of the countless classics relegated to lower ranks here. Similarly. Zoom has no business being rated lower than a piece of garbage like I Accuse My Parents which wasn't even watchable when it was skewered on Mystery Science Theater 3000.Remember folks most movies are mediocre. That means a low rating, not the bottom rating. Furthermore, just because a movie is exciting or satisfying doesn't make it a 10. For example, one can love the original Star Wars movies and still realize they have occasional flaws in acting, direction, pacing, or script.Is Zoom a great movie? Absolutely not. Will some children, some parents, and even some adults without children enjoy it? Yes. Will it go down in history for being remarkable in any way? Probably not."
tt0383060,"Remember how in the 70's you could tell the production value of a film by how often you saw the boom mike fall into view of the actors- well thanks to boom operator Darryl Purdy and the laziness of Peter ""I apparently never watch the dailies"" Hewitt, you can see the boom mike fall into view 3 separate times. That said allow me to point out that the cute little girl who acts as badly as her speech impediment can't save the film in the same way that the Brady Bunch would not have been popular with a the show devoted to Cindy Brady. There was so much wasted possibility showing us the back ground of these characters the over use of montage and collage editing would not have been needed. Also the film has three apparent villains in the film except none of them are bad and we never know why two of them are necessarily considered bad- but that's o.k. because the story was written by someone with ADD or perhaps short term memory loss as significant as the character in ""Memento"".The story has no continuity- Tim Allen hates the kids he plays with the kids he feels sorry for the kids no wait he doesn't understand why he's there to train the kids_ FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MAKE UP YOUR MIND!!! Nothing in this movie fit together- and in the end the super evil villain (whom we have waited 90 minutes to see) gets a scolding in the last 6 minutes of the movie and then it's over. Didn't Peter Hewitt read the script before filming oh no wait this is the same guy that gave us ""Bogus Journey""- you remember- the sequel that ended the Bill and Ted franchise. Not to mention the Garfield Movie.. a comic strip so revered for 30 years they made it into a Saturday morning cartoon but the movie that couldn't keep the audiences attention for 90 minutes (success based solely on a lack of other children films during its release and parents who grew up with Garfield the previous generation)...WHY DOES PETER HEWITT GET WORK, why?? Afterall,it is the directors responsibility for many things including having a working script and a vision before starting a project ( the exceptions being Andy Warhol who's audience base was too stoned to notice and Francis Ford Coppola with ""Apocalypse Now"" who had several million dollars to keep his dream afloat. Peter Hewitt should be ashamed of himself for this crap."
tt0383060,"Zoom will not only be remembered with such dogs as Ishtar, Howard the Duck and Gigli, but also as one of the most blatantly thieving movies of all time. The only way to stay awake while watching Zoom is to count how many scenes, characters and story ideas are stolen from other movies. From X-Men and Sky High to Spy Kids and Fantastic 4, on and on, this movie steals from everyone. And none of it works! The most interesting anomaly is that finally there's a movie with Chevy Chase where the material is worse than he is. (Sorry Chevy, but six or seven movies not withstanding, your career consists of mostly dogs.) But the problem with Zoom is not the actors, it's the script. At least Howard the Duck and Ishtar, garbage that they were, were fairly original. Zoom is recycled, regurgitated crap from uninspired filmmakers, and it's just another nail in the coffin that was once Hollywood."
tt0383060,"It was nothing short of painful.I took an 11 year old to see this movie, and he was actually sore at me for suggesting the movie.The way I see it Peter Hewitt owes me $20 for the movie tickets and 3 hours of my life back (1.5 hr for the movie, 1/2 hr for the drive, and 1 hr for all the time I spent bitching about how awful it really was)!From the boom mic in the shots, to the five minute fight scene at the end, to the terrible acting by the team as a whole, to the total lack of understanding behind the conflict with Chevy Chase and Rip Torn and the team, to Tim Allen's lack of understood emotion, to Courtney Cox's most painful character to date - the movie was just plain awful."
tt0383060,"It is conceivable that a movie about four misfit young people turned superheros could have been made into an enjoyable family film, but someone made a serious wrong turn early in the film-making process here. To make matters worse, rather than abandoning this sinking ship early on, or starting over at square one, the filmmakers appear to have blindly moved forward producing what can only be described as a disaster that will quickly find a home among the most poorly rated movies at IMDb and leave theaters quickly.The biggest question I have is why? Why was this movie made? Why was no one minding the store? Why was this screenplay ever permitted to see the light of day? I took my five year-old to the movie because the previews looked okay and we love movies. The fact that it took less than five minutes for him to get fidgety after the movie started was probably a good clue to what was ahead. He never did calm down and I'm not sure he paid attention to more than ten minutes of the whole movie.The script and sets are both beyond ridiculous and rarely make any sense at any time during the movie. Some of the acting is really over the top absurd, Rip Torn and Chevy Chase come to mind. With the exception of Courntey Cox, this film seems like it exists purely to provide a vehicle for over the hill actors to bring in a little up front income. However, since this movie will not turn a profit, it is the studio that will pay price in the end and I suppose they deserve it.There are a few moments in the first 15 minutes of the movie where you have a hope that something good will happen in the movie, but we quickly discover that the purposes behind bringing this group of kids together are entirely unsound and unexplainable and the rest of the movie has been constructed around random events placed in the film for no apparent reason other than to fill the obligatory 90 minutes minimum required for all non-animated movies.Besides all of the rest of what makes this movie rotten, the worst thing of all is that there never turns out to be any plausible reason to have brought these four kids together in the first place to make them superheros.By the time we arrived at the end of the movie, I cared so little about what happened to any of the characters, that I was just bouncing around in my seat, looking over at my wife and child and praying it would end any moment.There are real reasons that this movie is nearly universally hated by professional critics and movie-goers alike and that is that this movie is entirely unoriginal, incoherent and borders on being unwatchable."
tt0383060,"""Zoom"" is a kids' superhero flick based on the novel ""Zoom's Academy"" written by Jason Lethcoe. In it, Tim Allen stars as a has-been superhero who's tasked to train four young superheroes to battle a nemesis. With that, you pretty much know what to expect. Unfortunately, that's all. While the film has all what comprises a prototype of this milked-dry genre, the experience is overtly familiar and dull.Jack Shephard (Allen... nope, not Matthew Fox) was Captain Zoom, a superhero who can travel at superhuman speeds, and one of the members of the military-sponsored superhero group ""Team Zenith."" But he has since lost his powers after a military experiment has gone awry that also has his teammates killed. 30 years later Jack is brought back to train four youngsters with superpowers when a new malevolent threat from the past emerges.First of all, the script of Adam Rifkin and David Berenbaum doesn't attain new heights with their blunt dealing of a theme that's been done more excellently with ""The Incredibles"" and ""Sky High."" And director Peter Hewitt (""Garfield""), who clearly isn't exactly a master storyteller himself, has little to work from with such a dull and hollow material. All of the characters are perfunctory parts rather than humans portraying genuine conflicts.Also, for a film that's called ""Zoom,"" the film drags: it lacks a sufficient amount of action. We're supposed to see the kids train, but all we're mostly shown are unfunny attempts at slapstick humor that the filmmakers assume would elicit laughters from the little tots among the audience (uhm, Courteney Cox tripping down and Chevy Chase getting slime on his face, anyone?). What constitutes for training involve at the most paint balls and a drive-thru chaos at a Wendy's restaurant. Yes, there's the climactic fight sequence at the end but it's too quick, unexciting, and not enough by a mile for a film that has terribly dragged along.Ultimately, what transpires is a terribly unfunny movie that wears out its welcome faster than its main character runs."
tt0383060,"I actually watched this movie before I read any of the reviews or comments on this site which is rare for me; I tend to value the reviews and rankings of the other members. This is the first time I am left scratching my head wondering what exact movie did you people watch to give it such low reviews??!! This movie is what it is and a very good job of it. It is a movie that makes fun of super hero movies. Take a bitter misfit ex-superhero who can't be any less interested in training new recruits and make it funny. Zoom has his reasons to be bitter and they are CLEARLY explained, if people don't get the plot, they weren't really paying attention. The acting in this movie is very good by a well collected cast. Allen and Chase deliver slapstick one liners throughout the whole movie that are truly reminiscent of their comedic classic styles. If the one liner isn't enough to make you laugh, add the highly adorable factor from Ryan Newman as Cindy Collins is tops. The rest of the cast works very well together and even though there is a lot of predictability in the movie, it is still very funny and worth the watch. This is not a literary classic brought to life, so don't expect it to be. The negative comments about Allen are unjust, as his character wasn't' that far off from his style in the Santa Clause movies. This movie was enjoyable and I laughed out loud many times and I don't do that often with movies because they just aren't as funny in the same style. If you want to just relax and laugh at a silly movie, the Zoom on over to your video store and pick this one up."
tt0383060,"My kids thought it was a great show. They ran around for the next week pretending to be really fast/invisible/strong.I wasn't very impressed. As ever the effects were adequate, even the story was good. The character development was lacking and the acting was wooden.The movie has a couple of guys who should be really funny; Tim Allen & Chevy Chase. They just weren't made use of in a funny way. Courtenay Cox was funnier and for her that's saying something.The climax was anticlimactic but I think this links back to poor character development. We just didn't get to know the bad guy enough to really care about him."
tt0383060,"Zoom is dreck.Granted, it's a kids flick. But the classic kids flicks endure because of quality. There is no quality of any sort in this junk. Of course, when you go to a movie these days and see ""Revolution Studios"" before the credits, you know you're going to end up with brain-numbing rot. (The biggest mistake Sony Pictures ever made was funding Revolution. The best move Sony Pictures ever made was closing the Revolution doors -- so to speak.) Oh...and you know you're in real trouble when this appears in the opening credits: Songs by Smashmouth.Tim Allen, Courtney Cox, Chevy Chase, and poor Rip Torn...ugh. What in the world were they thinking? I know the first three aren't A-listers, but a seeing genuine talent like Torn wasted in slop such as this is depressing. ""Forty Shades of Blue"" one minute, ""Zoom"" the next. Oh well, it pays the bills, I suppose.And my, how Chase has fallen. Every now and then, a spark of his former talented self glimmers through, but mostly he's stuck doing embarrassing schtick. (One scene where his character is stuck in an ""outdoor simulator"" is just awful. He mugs and dances around like a second rate Rip Taylor...without the feminine traits, obviously.)"
tt0383060,"An odd group of super hero misfits must be shaped up by a dimwitted leader Zoom (Money whore Tim Allen). Some of the child actors are okay but their powers and the whole back story is foggy. Despite they need to be trained at the Academy there was, for me, no good reason to care. Allen after doing ""Shaggy Dog"" (another runner up for worst of 06) shows that despite the god awful taste in film selections he is just doing it for the MONEY. So the next Allen flick that comes out don't expect some kind of descent film just expect Tim laughing it up on screen pulling ridiculous stunts like ""Zoom"". Despite the kids, probably who this mess was made for it is regrettable, despicable and down right dimwitted. *1/2"
tt0383060,"I seriously had a bad feeling when I hurried to get out of the video store that I had to do a wise pick on a kiddie like movie. I thought when I first rented this movie it would be pretty good and funny since Tim Allen was acting in it. But what can I say when I started watching it, it was to do with four kid super heroes and their leader Zoom from a comic book came to life in such a crude humoured film! I mean I need to say they introduced the characters like the four kids which was a little six year old girl who could lift up to ten pounds of weight, a fat chubby boy who can make his body go even fatter and bigger and can squash anyone in his way, a teenage girl who has the power to stare and control any like object or thing with her eyes and a boy who could turn invisible and use his mind to see things from a far distance. The only thing I liked about this movie was just about the end of the film, where there was quite a impressive battle with Jack's evil brother Conner and he finally showed off his zooming power to plan on making his brother part of his family again. But trust me I'll warn any viewer if you really want to see this movie you likely only need to see it once or even half of it since it's like the worst movie ever created in the history of the universe! Period!"
tt0383060,"Kids movies are declining in quality over the years, ""excluding Pixar and maybe Dreamworks"" and this rings ever so true in Zoom: Academy for Superheroes.Searching the IMDb user reviews about this movie i was shocked to see such quotes as 'Great Movie' or 'Best Kids Movie EVER!' or even a worrying 'Best Film of 2006'.If you have gone to see the movie without a child by your side, then you will be horribly disappointed by what this movie has to offer.Key points such as the 'revival' of Chevy Chase and others are put down early in the film when you find that they are hamming through the worst dialog ever, eg. ""I speak Greek, not Geek"" etc. etc, Enough to make kids the world over roll their eyes knowingly.The fact that it has a short cinema life probably contributed to the overall quality of life.Has your child had an IQ test? If so, children above the 110 mark will have trouble being entertained by the lousy performances of the actors. We all know Tim Allen's been a bit off lately, but this takes the cake.So, others may say that the acting was 'forgivable' and that critic's harsh reviews were only so because they were taking the movie seriously. Hmm. I think those that were prepared to give the movie a 'Perfect' 10 stars have an insanely different viewpoint to life. Any score under six would be a rational average for mentally stable people. Should come with label saying -do not buy-.Summing up Zoom: -Bad acting and bland story, kids may like it if not put off, but you'll be snoozing in your seat."
tt0383060,"""Zoom"" is a fun movie for two audiences. It's a comedy sci-fi flick that was made for kids, with a far-out allusion to the super-heroes group from the age of comic books. The humor appeals a little bit to we older movie buffs. But of more interest and entertainment for the older movie crowd are the two characters, Dr. Grant and General Laraby.Chevy Chase is a hoot as the government scientist, Dr. Grant, and Rip Torn is very funny in his frequent role as a cantankerous commander of some sort from films of the past. Tim Allen and the younger cast who play the super heroes are okay and should amuse the younger of the young crowd who follow the superheroes. Of course, once they reach about eight years of age, the kids are no longer dazzled by these more comical, kid-friendly characters. They're ready for the tougher, rougher, more daring super hero flicks. They want the ""real thing"" like the adults. You know, Spiderman, Batman, Superman, Wolverine and Captain America.My grandkids, the youngest ones anyway, get a kick out of flicks like this."
tt0383060,"I would rather watch just about anything than have to see this absolutely clichéd-wanna-be-superhero flick. It is terrible and pointless as can be. It really is ashame that the adorable (And upcoming star I might add) Kate Mara having to be in this piece of garbage. It is even more sad seeing the once great Chevy Chase in a 8th supporting role and being over-shadowed by... well everything! I don't recommend this to anyone, unless you get it free and want to laugh at all the stupidity involved in it. Maybe it will go down as one of those movies you laugh at because it is so dumb later down the line, but I doubt that happening. I'm actually surprised this isn't even rated lower than what it is rated now. It really makes you wonder how kind of talented people like Tim Allen, Courtney Cox, and the already mentioned (and Lovely I might add) Kate Mara. Here's hoping that this is one of those flicks that gets forgotten. I also hope that it isn't held against any of the kids who were in it either. It gets the rating it gets because the production values are passable, and Courtney Cox still looks great."
tt0383060,"This movie was not that bad. My kids loved it and so did all the other kids in the theater. So what if it is a formula movie...it is for children. There is a lot of family moments in this movie. It is geared toward teamwork and thinking about others instead of yourself all the time. It has slapstick humor and some gross adolescent type jokes, but clean language and the kids seem to stand up for each other, which is nice. The little girl does have anger management issues. This is no Academy award winner, but a decent movie for preteen kids. I would say most kids under 13 will like this movie. It's nice not to have to worry about language even if there are some gross special effects... What else is Tim Allen suppose to be in...I don't see Hollywood knocking down his door for serious movies. He's a comedian turned actor and is good for kids movies. I like seeing Courtney Cox in it as well. Maybe she will well in the area of family movies. Better than all that junk Jennifer Aniston is killing us with. Over all I didn't mind this movie which is more than what I could say for some of the other kid movies I've seen and would recommend it to others."
tt0383060,"A very pleasant children's movie, with roots from power rangers. This movie would have been miserable had it not been for the comedic talents of Tim Allen and Chevy Chase. But the two of them managed to pull a rating of six out of me with almost non-stop laughs. The action in this movie leaves something to be desired however. Go see it for the comedy, not the action. I will not give away the ending, but I will tell you that it is probably safe for you to walk out of the theater at about the 75m minute mark. After that the movie becomes even more predictable than it already was, and that is really not good. But once again the laughs save this movie from dismal failure."
tt0383060,Jack Shepard (Tim Allen) is disillusioned bitter former super-speed superhero and sole survivor Captain Zoom of Team Zenith. Dr. Grant (Chevy Chase) exposed the team to Gamma-13 which turned older brother Connor/Concussion to the dark side 30 years ago destroying the team. Now General Larraby (Rip Torn) in Area 52 and Grant bring back Jack with the help of psychologist Marsha Holloway (Courteney Cox) to train a new group of kids. Dylan West (Michael Cassidy) is a teen with invisibility and clairvoyance. Summer Jones (Kate Mara) has telekinetic powers and empathic senses. Tucker Williams (Spencer Breslin) can blow up parts of his body. Little Cindy Collins (Ryan Newman) has super strength.Tim Allen is too bitter and sarcastic. Chevy Chase is silly without being funny. He's just a pathetic shadow of his former self. The adults are the problem of this movie. This needs to be about the kids. The little girl is actually quite funny. The kids need more screen time to develop. This is simply a badly thought out comic book movie.
tt0383060,"My Take: A positively dull family comedy with one pathetic excuse for comedy after another. Not tired by the success of THE INCREDIBLES and SKY HIGH, Disney reuses the tired ""average-ordinary everyday superheroes"" formula once more, this time one time too many. Finally overusing it to the death, Disney's ZOOM is bland, unfunny and totally juvenile excuse for family entertainment which may find audiences in the younger set, but will totally annoy anyone above the age line of ages 1-6. While the presence of Tim Allen and his sarcastic bite of humor lightens things up, the product itself is light enough with a completely empty script, free from any funny or original ideas. It... was just pathetic.Allen plays a retired superhero who is recalled by his associates, a clumsy scientist played by a wasted Chevy Chase, to train a couple of newbie superheroes, including ones that disappears in thin air (Dylan West, played by Michael Cassidy), who can control objects at will (Summer Jones, played by Kate Mara), who can inflate himself to the size of hot-air balloon (Tucker Williams, played by Spencer Breslin) and a little girl with the strength of The Hulk (Cindy Collins, played by Ryan Newman), and you won't like her when she's angry too (as a matter of fact, I didn't like her... at all). First of all, he has to cope with their irregularities and life problems to training them with the use of their powers. But that hardly passes as a screenplay, as the movie not doesn't have any big laughs, but the story and characters are as empty as the entire exhausted enterprise. Allen can do funny, but he's as tired as anyone else in this fabricated mess.If their not tired, their embarrassing, which is twice as worse. Need I mention Courtney Cox in such an embarrassing performance? Need I mention Chevy Chase in a waste role that can be played by anyone... even your grandpa? Or what about that annoying little girl, whom the writers call ""cute"". How does any money-hungry exec at work in this claptrap expect the audience to buy into some theatrical film that would run fine in local cable for cheaper effect. Director Pete Hewitt (director of the similarly dull GARFIELD) seems more suited to local cable, as his project just yells out ""made for TV"" all over. The special effects are not at aplenty, but still awful in every sense. The acting is extremely feeble, but who could blame 'em? The script isn't exactly working class material! On top of it all, it all comes down to the energy. There's no energy, no fun at all to be had in ZOOM, at least not to any older audience. Kids, as usual, will find ZOOM quite a treat. Adults will be forced to find a liking for counting grain when forced to watch this. Don't take the risk! Rating: * out of 5."
tt1287468,"The children will really like this film, but the adults won't. So I advice you to go to the movie theaters as a family and your 4-12 years old go watch this film and you and our spouse or partner watch a more grown up film like Inception or if you have already seen Inception, then go watch Salt. However this isn't the worst film ever, or the worst film of Summer 2010, there are actually some funny and enjoyable moments in this film, however there aren't many of them at all. If it was consistently funny, I'd recommend it to the whole family or anyone looking for a good time.This film is actually better than Marmaduke, but its still very dull and really not funny. It won't be a horrible experience watching this film, but it will be boring.4/10"
tt1287468,"This belated sequel to the 2001 box-office hit Cats & Dogs is better than I expected. That's not to say it's great, it's not, but there have been far inferior kiddie films I've sat through this year with my four year old (not naming any names... Alvin and Shrek). There's free-flowing action that will entertain the younglings and the animals themselves are cute and/or funny enough to please all audience members, though the plot has more than its fair share of eye-rolling moments and the CGI is poorer than it should be considering the movie's $85m budget.The gags are hit or miss, however the few that stick are quite amusing. A riff on Silence of the Lambs is hilarious and provides the sole laugh-out-loud scene whilst the Head of M.E.O.W (the feline secret service agency) Tab Lazenby – cheekily voiced by Roger Moore – offers plenty of 007 parodied humour. Elsewhere the talented voice cast do their best to inject energy into the frequently lack-lustre and cheesy script. Marsden is likable as lead mutt Diggs, Nolte is gruff as ever as Alec Baldwin's replacement for the hardened Butch, Applegate brings the sass as Catherine and Midler is clearly having a blast as the malevolent Kitty. Chris O'Donnell fares a lot worse as live-action character Shane, Diggs' loving ex-cop partner, his unabashed mugging an absolute low in his career.Decent enough viewing with the nippers on a wet weekend.2.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"
tt1287468,"Mary wanted to see it-- her rule is, if it's got a cat in it, she wants to see it. Quick summary: the trailer shows all the good scenes. The first movie had been mildly cute, although forgettable. The highlight of sequel should have been ""more really cute dogs and cats."" But they decided to put an average (full grown) German Shepherd in the lead (instead of the cute puppy from the first movie), and focused too much on the pigeon (who, admittedly, did get most of the good lines). The supporting cat was good, but had too little screen time. Most of the plot was quotes from other movies, with cats and dogs playing the parts (in particular, the opening title scene was a very well done version of the old James Bond movie title sequences). Except for where it was a direct parody of other movies, the plot was mostly perfunctory, and the denouement was a long and mostly incomprehensible action scene. The 3- D was both irrelevant, and also badly done. See it in 2D. If you see it, do stick through the credits for the final scene."
tt1287468,"My family and I really liked the first one so we were excited to see this when the previews came out. It was no where close to being as entertaining as the first. We just saw it again on TV the other night so it wasn't like we were living in the past. This sequel just wasn't good or funny. There was a guy sitting near us that laughed his pants off at the previews before the movie and I didn't hear him once during the feature (and he would have laughed at someone farting)! And as other previewers mentioned, the 3D brought nothing to the table. So, don't waste you money, wait to rent it. There were a few good scenes but the key word is ""few"". Im not the type to go to a kids movie and expect something other than a kids movie, but....Marmaduke should win an Acadamy Award next to this one (Marmaduke was actually very good and worth seeing)."
tt1287468,"Well, the official website for ""Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" has a paw for a mouse pointer, the movie uses most every lazy pun possible about pets, and a reviewer has already claimed the movie marks the end of civilization as we know it. With such prospects, a film about talking cats and dogs coming together to fight off Kitty Galore (voiced by Bette Midler) doesn't eye well for adults. And it doesn't. Any mathematicians in the theater can better spend their time tracking the noticeable upward curve of boredom and silliness the longer the movie runs (the pet gags during the end credits don't count).Aren't kids movies like this supposed to be funny despite their absurdity? It took 9 years to bring this sequel of ""Cats & Dogs"" to the theaters, which gave it plenty of time to spread a wide umbrella for big name voices. Nick Nolte's deep scratchy voice took to the end credits to figure out, but it stands out in his role as a scrappy mentor dog, Butch, the muscle of a secret agency run by semi-intelligent talking dogs.We learn that dogs have an underground spy organization where no human has ever entered, appropriately outfitted with hi-tech gadgets in the Bond tradition and specially tailored for dog clichés. Cats have a similar underground facility for their secret organization, named MEOWS. The first pet puns are quirky and tone setting, but after the third or fourth - and when combined with lame cultural references (including Hannibal Lecter and who knows what else) - it becomes torture.The main character is a German shepherd police dog named Diggs (James Marsden), who joins a band of unlikely heroes to try to protect humans against Kitty Galore. Diggs follows the 'Dirty Harry' template of the ends justifies his means, that is, he causes havoc while taking down a madman and tends to set off fiery explosions in the process. So, of course, he's recruited by Butch (Nick Nolte) to join the secret dog organization. Diggs and Butch reluctantly join teams with a top kitty agent, Catherine (Christina Applegate), from MEOWs. Along for the ride is a pea brained pigeon, Seamus (Katt Williams), to provide comic relief.The plot is adequately thin and senseless. They battle against Kitty Galore (voiced by Bette Midler), a hairless Sphinx cat, who plans to enslave humans and take over the world. Her plan is to use malevolent sound waves, from a weapon called ""The Call of the Wild"" (by the way), at an ultra low frequency (just for dogs) to trigger all dogs to violently rebel against humans. Humans will have to lock them all in kennels. But the movie forgets to mention how Kitty Galore intends to conquer humans. Will she change the frequencies and use the weapon on us? She doesn't specify, but perhaps she could change to an appropriate frequency to trigger our caveman impulses, or something.Kitty Galore is funny as she reluctantly placates her not so magical magician owner. She became evil because her previous owners treated her like a freak and threw her out after she fell into a vat of hair removal cream (like the Joker from ""Batman""). The movie has a couple other funny moments with a house filled of too-lazy-to-move high cats, and a goofy Calico cat voiced by Wallace Shawn (lampooning his role in ""The Princess Bride""). Other stars take part in hopes of success, including Neil Patrick Harris, Roger Moore, and Joe Pantoliano, but it doesn't help much.Some of the most effective scenes are ones where pets give normal pet reactions. The audience actually responded to Diggs whimpering as he was locked in his cage by his former cop partner, played by Chris O'Donnell (in one of the few human roles). The pets only pretend to act normal around humans, but on occasion a little girl stumbles on them talking. She's amazed, no one believes her, and the pets resort to clichés (butt sniffing for dogs).That's it. Most of the other jokes are dull. The movie becomes so lazy, any action is just meaningless and boring. The movie uses a mix of live action animals, puppetry, and computer animation to bring the pets to life. The CGI mouths attempt to make such absurdity seem real, but who cares when what they say isn't funny or interesting. The 3D wasn't very noticeable at all."
tt1287468,"Cats & Dogs [2]: The Revenge of Kitty Galore (1:22, PG-13, 3-D) — other: talking animals; 3rd string; sequelI created the ""talking animals"" subcategory after years of frustration trying to figure out whether to slot things like this under SF, fantasy, or elsewhere. Now no agonizing is required: Anything that involves chatty critters (or cars, babies, vegetables, toys, or other entities that aren't actually capable of speech) just gets dumped here.There's a general sense that these things tend to be kiddie fare with low production values and even lower IQ expectations. But a review of the 74 such movies since 2000 shows that they aren't much different than SF&F movies in general, coming in with an average rating of 4.92 on my scale of 1-9 (compared to a 4.93 average for the other 474 movies in my database). Some of them have been superb (Bolt, Toy Story 2, Up), and others very good (Charlotte's Web, Finding Nemo, The Golden Compass, a couple of Ice Age movies, Monsters Inc., Ratatouille, Toy Story 3, and Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit).At the other end of the scale are the movies that give rise to the stereotype: Garfield, Scooby Doo, Space Chimps, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Beverly Hills Chihuahua, VeggieTales, Marmaduke, Rugrats, Furry Vengeance, and 2 wretched excrescences called Yu-Gi-Oh and Tamala 2010.The original Cats & Dogs (2001) was dead average with a 5 rating. It certainly was not the kind of artistic triumph or blockbuster hit that demanded a sequel, but we got one anyway, this one in (all together now: ooooooo) 3-D, as if that alone justifies its existence. Is it a dog or the cat's meow? (Puns intended; please don't hurt me.)Well, in the tradition of such things, there are bones thrown (ouch) to the adults, including a lot of smirky allusions to the James Bond oeuvre. 007 fans will recognize that ""Kitty Galore"" is a pun on Bond girl Pussy Galore (itself a smirking pun on something that will never sneak into a PG movie). There are silhouettes and sultry female vocals under the opening credits. And Bond actor (1973-1985) Roger Moore does one of the voices, for ""Tab Lazenby"", head of Mousers Enforcing Our World's Safety (MEOWS), reminding old farts like me that the immediate successor to Sean Connery was not Moore but the hapless George Lazenby, about whom nothing has been heard since 1969.Nor do they stop there. I have to give Writers Ron Friedman and Steve Bencich and Director Brad Peyton credit for working really hard at throwing in a lot of code words, images, and background business designed to appeal to adults. Much of it was pretty clever, including allusions to movies made well before the target audience for this film was even born. But the result is schizophrenic. It's like going to see the Jerry Lewis version of Hamlet and discovering Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud playing Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.In the final analysis, tho, do we go to see a movie just for the puns?*No, we don't, and regrettably the ostensible surface plot of the movie, tho crammed with substance, snappy dialog, and a certain cockeyed coherence, is pretty insipid. Once again, dogs and cats are portrayed as mortal enemies enslaved to their basic natures, except that this time they're required to *gasp* work together to foil the evil machinations of criminal mastermind Kitty Galore, who intends to broadcast a worldwide dog-whistle tone (from a CD helpfully Sharpied with the legend ""The Call of the Wild"") that will turn her canine nemeses into snarling menaces, thus bringing their doom upon them as an alarmed humanity wipes them all out. There are more twists and turns as well (as I said, no lack of filling), but it's all pretty much of the same caliber.The voice cast features many B-list names for no discernible reason and to no audible benefit (except for Bette Midler as Kitty), and the visual cast is a bunch of animals trained to assume unnatural positions and have matchmove artists do strange CGI things with their jaws. This is only fitfully effective.I saw the film in 3-D. The good news is that the main feature was preceded by ""Coyote Falls"", a 3-minute roadrunner cartoon in a passable imitation of the grand cel-animation tradition, and it used 3-D to marvelous advantage with Wile E.'s latest Acme acquisition, a bungee cord. The bad news is that the 3-D imaging in the movie itself was sloppy, with numerous cases of dogs having doubled snouts, or a patch of fur seeming to float above the surface of the cat it was nominally attached to. This is a movie that didn't care enuf to send the very best.I do appreciate the attempt to give the adults something to care about, tho, and it was accomplished without having to distract the kids from the story they came to see, so the overall effect is to get a gentleman's D+ from me.––––––*Besides, for SF&F fans, they're not even nerd puns."
tt1287468,"I am 19 and I loved the original when I was younger, and I wanted to check this one out as I thought it would bring back memories, and it did. After seeing such a low score, I didn't expect it to be that great, but I found myself enjoying the film after a very short time.The movie was actually pretty funny, and I don't normally find kids movies very funny, but this was actually good as a sequel. No, it wasn't amazing or even great, but it definitely wasn't bad and didn't deserve such a low rating. I've seen much worse kids movies get higher ratings than this.You need to approach it with an open mind and remember that it is a kids movie and you will enjoy this, especially if you love animals or have a younger friend who loves animals to watch it with.I have been waiting for years for a sequel to the original, and while this one wasn't as great as I remember the original being, it was still an enjoyable movie with many laughs, and familiar characters.The special effects were definitely not the best I've seen, but there isn't anything wrong with that, the movie wasn't trying to be mind blowing, but the effects got the job done. Its a good sequel full of laughs and fun for the family to enjoy.If you can approach this movie with an open mind, and remember its not an adult's film, but fun for the family, you will find plenty of enjoyment and laughs for everyone in the family."
tt1287468,"I cannot believe that this movie has such a low rating. It is a kid's movie people! You have to take it for what it is, it's not meant to be a mind provoking film! I thought it was pretty funny and I enjoyed it. It's much better then the other movies for kid's that have been released lately. The movie was excellent and I especially thought Mr. Tinkle's performance definitely stole the show once he was on screen. There were many scenes throughout the film that had me laughing so hard I cried. If you do not like kid's movies then don't see this- plain and simple! But if you are like me and you want to see it just for the cute comedy then see it. Personally I thought it was funnier then a lot of comedies for adults."
tt1287468,"I went to the cinema to watch this movie because my girlfriend really appreciated the first part which I've never seen and she convinced me to come with her. She bought the DVD of the first movie and there was a special gift card in it which allowed her to have a reduction of ten dollars on a ticket for the sequel and so we went to the cinema.I didn't expect anything from this movie and I wouldn't usually comment on such a movie because it is simply not my kind of genre, but as I see now such horrible votes and the movie entering in the infamous top one hundred bottom list, I thought I'd be better if I might write my opinion, because this movie isn't simply that bad - and I am generally kind of severe on movies! While watching this movie for one and a half hour, I've never taken a look on my watch, I've never felt bored at all and I found this movie very entertaining. There were also a lot of nice laughs, especially the naive but sympathetic pigeon was worth the watch - and let me tell you that it is rather difficult to make me laugh. Beside the pigeon, the little girl which always saw the animals making crazy things while her mother didn't recognize anything was an entertaining running gag, too. Another funny thing was the scene in the animal's Alcatraz which I thought was a nice idea. The collaboration, the prejudices and the growing team spirit between the secret agencies of the cats and the dogs were also some really nice elements in this movie even if they were predictable. And the movie even had something philosophical: Cats and dogs put away their prejudices to save their beloved humans together and fight a common enemy. Well, I know, this is a predictable content, too, but still very touching and even teaching for young kids who are watching this movie. And the idea of adapting the world of James Bond to the world of cats and dogs isn't silly at all, but very funny for the kids, nicely done for the adults who understand some funny allusions and certainly better than most of the boring super agent comedy movie in the key of Austin Powers and other boring stuff.A part of that, the movie is well animated and has a perfect length. People who really like cats or especially dogs might even give a few stars more, for example for the funny and cute video clips in the end of the movie.Of course, this movie is just a sequel, it shows nothing innovating and the story is predictable and of course there are no twists in the movie, but you can't expect that from any animation movie a part of the amazing ""Wall-E"". Some people here say that you should put the children into the cinema to watch this movie and head yourself for the - in my opinion - heavily overrated ""Inception"" - I mean, you just can't compare those movies and if you take this point as a judgement, it is certain that you may be disappointed.So, don't listen to some of those really ordinary and exaggerated hate comments and spend some ninety minutes with your kids or younger sister or girlfriend or cat/dog fetish, switch your brain off and enjoy the nice jokes and this very entertaining movie.5,5 to 6 stars out of 10!"
tt1287468,First part of the movie was quite interesting to watch like 5-6 but this one huh... If directors/producers/creators are out of ideas they shouldn't even try to create film just to try make some cash. This movie doesn't worth your time. Trust me...
tt1287468,"I'm 42 and this is the second kid oriented film I've seen in less then two weeks, the first was Beezus And Ramona. I guess maybe in a way I'm a kid at heart. I never saw the first Dogs And Cats so I can't compare. I can say that this is a fun, breezy way to spend 82 minutes. I like how this spoofs James Bond movies right down to the opening credits and the name Kitty Galore. Also, Roger Moore does one of the voices and his character is named Tab Lazenby (for you Bond trivia lovers, George Lazenby played 007 in 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service). Don't call me weird but I think that there is a good message for children in this film, let me explain. The dogs and cats join forces to stop this rogue cat Kitty Galore. This teaches kids that you should put aside petty things to band together as a team. Oh, they also do a good job of spoofing Silence Of The Lambs. My only real complaint isn't with the animals its with one of the humans in the film, that goofy magician Kitty was working for. He was so annoying."
tt1287468,"I loved the first Cats and Dogs; the action, the CGI, the story. It was great fun and I still laugh at it even now at the age of 18! I did not expect the sequel to be that good, because it is released around 9 years after the original; all the fans are grown up, and the new generation have moved onto different things. I prefer animations (usually!), and because it was a sequel to a childhood favourite, I decided to give it a go, for nostalgic reasons, and for love of dogs! (I like cats, too hahaha :D).The movie brings back original characters; Lou the beagle (Neil Patrick Harris), Butch the Anatolian Shepherd Dog (Nick Nolte), Shep the Old English Sheepdog (Michael Clark Duncan), Peek the Chinese Crested (can't remember his voice actor), and even a cameo of Mr.Tinkles the Persian cat! (Sean Hayes). Lou, despite the different actor, still sounded somewhat like himself, and even though his character changed A lot, he was still a good supporting character. I was disappointed by his change of character, simply because it disregards his role in the first film almost completely. It does, however, add a certain level of maturity to Lou. Butch's voice actor sounds older that Alec Baldwin, however, this shows his maturity and how the film is clearly set a few years after the first. Diggs (James Mardsen) the German Shepherd/Alsatian, is a great character, and does bring colour and humour to the film, as well as a level of humanity; what I mean is, it shows the dog having problems, which the audience can relate to, much like Butch in the original. Catherine (Christina Applegate) is another great addition, and the chemistry between her and Diggs as characters, no matter how cliché, is believable and humorous. Kitty Galore (a Sphynx Cat) is very well animated, and voiced fantastically by Bette Midler. She is a typical villaness, and is wonderful!The story, in my opinion, is bland. I understand Kitty's turmoil and want of revenge, but to enslave all mankind? C'mon Kitty, everybody has ups and downs, don't ya think you're overracting a bit? Just my two cents. At least Tinkles wanted to obliterate dog kind (in some sense) so cats will become ""Top Dog"" again. All cats were besmirched in C&D~#1, in Kitty Galore, why could she not seek revenge on that one dog? Or her family? What do you think?The action is plentyful, the CGI brilliant. The puppets were kind of stupid, and removed whatever smoothness one can find within the film. The whole cats and dogs working together is a good message for kids, showing you should overlook your differences etc in the face of adversity, to help one other out and build a bond.The humour, no matter how over done, is funny, especially the cats on 'nip! Some is cringeworthy, though.Finally; Seamus, the pigeon. I did not like him at all. He, in my opinion, added nothing to the story, even though he was meant to, and he annoyed me for the most part.Overall, if you are a die hard fan of the original, don't expect too much. The Brady's are never mentioned, and the only reference is the recurring characters. It is, however, a fun and enjoyable film, but mainly for the kiddies due to the humour in question.5/10.(my first review!!!)"
tt1287468,"I kind of enjoyed this. I liked the original 9 years ago, and this kept the same feel and sense of humor. The human actors are just a distraction to the spy like efforts of the cats and dogs, and there are no characters as funny as some of the cats in the original. The CGI, real animals, and puppetry, comes together most of the time, and it doesn't matter when it looks a bit ridiculous. The brief segments of Sean Hayes proves that he was the driving force of the original, and he should have been a main focus here. Like most childish children's films, there are many annoying characters and a lot of lame jokes, which had me groaning and sighing. Probably a bit too long went by between this and the original. Luckily, it allows new viewers to slip right in."
tt1287468,"I wasn't a huge fan of the first Cats and Dogs movie and I hated this one even more. This is just a series of really bad parodies thrown together, most noticeably based on the James Bond series. You will see and hear a few lines from other classics which are also done poorly. It wasn't that funny, it wasn't engaging, the special effects are behind - I don't think there is any part of this movie that was done right. I only managed to smirk two or three times during the movie, all thanks to Katt Williams, but this wasn't his thing. He is normally a lot funnier. I would much rather watch his stand up than waste money on this movie. I don't think this would be a good kids movie either since it is based on the Bond series. Could you imagine what your kid would do if they found out Kitty Galore is suppose to be Pussy Galore? It would be the perfect excuse for them to yell out ""Pussy!"" all the time. This movie was a bad idea before the script writer put his pen to his notepad. My recommendation is to give this movie a pass , run as far away from it as you can, and don't ever look back. It isn't even worthy of the bargain bin at a used video shop."
tt1287468,"Probably my shortest review ever. For once, I have very little to say about a movie. Please see my blog for other titles.I often include my son's views in the reviews that I write on my blog, and we frequently differ in opinion. Even Ricky agreed with me this time. There was no need for this movie to be in 3-D. This is starting to become irksome. Theaters charge more for 3-D movies, which I'm happy to pay, when it is worthwhile.However, this is probably where my 10-year-old and I depart in our opinion.Your kids are going to love this movie. Spying and flying dogs, cats and birds, working together to take down one seriously disturbed kitty -- what's not for them to love? Although there was an extended scene that replicated Silence of the Lambs. Needless to say, the kids aren't going to understand that reference, so I'm not at all sure why it was included. Obviously, it was an attempt to bring parents into the movie, but as it was poorly done, it failed miserably.Parents, what can I say? If it weren't a darkened movie theater, I would say bring a book. Do they still have those Itty Bitty Book Lights? This is not a movie you are going to see with hopes of being entertained. You will see it because your kids are begging for it. If you can get them to go to Despicable Me or The Sorcerer's Apprentice instead, go for it.Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore is a boring sequel that should have gone straight to video. The voice talents of heavy hitters such as James Marsden, Christina Applegate, Bette Midler, Sean Hayes, Neil Patrick Harris and Nick Nolte wasted."
tt1287468,"Had I known that this film would not be 100% horrible, then I probably never would have seen it. Yes, I love a bad movie now and then and last time I checked, it was on IMDb's Bottom 100 list. However, I now noticed that the film has a much higher rating (3.4) and it is no longer on the list. So, it's obviously not a good film, but not bad enough I should have sought it out to fulfill my bad movie addiction.Unlike a truly bad film, there is an audience for this film. Undemanding children (no older than perhaps 10) would probably laugh at the film and its countless poop and fart jokes, a bald cat, tons of stunts and just the sight of seeing talking pets. All this make for a bad and especially annoying film but you can't blame the kids--after all, most children are not movie reviewers and don't mind all this silliness! But, for anyone older than 10, it will be a chore to watch--and at times pretty painful. It's a shame, as the first film, ""Cats & Dogs"" was pretty good and had some appeal for all ages--whereas ""Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" would only appeal to someone over age 10 if they have very, very, very low standards...or a traumatic brain injury.My verdict: dumb and tedious but also fun for young kids. Parents, if you ARE forced to watch it, I suggest watching it along with copious amounts of your favorite HIGH alcohol content beverage."
tt1287468,"Took my sons aged 4 & 6 to this & they loved it. It may not be the most entertaining movie ever for adults, but heck, it passed a morning of the school holidays, & that's good enough for me. Being a Bond fan, I loved the opening credits & liked the fact that they were copying that genre. I confess to intermittent feelings of boredom, but have yet to sit through a kid's movie where this was not the case at some point. It is clearly very very difficult to make a film which genuinely entertains adults and children throughout - if they manage to make both laugh at some point, they are doing well in my humble opinion! I asked my kids whether they had preferred Toy Story 3 (which has a much higher rating on IMDb) or Cats & Dogs, and they said they had liked both just the same. Perhaps IMDb should only allow kids to review kids films! Adults, this film may not be Oscar material, but lets keep things in perspective."
tt1287468,"I'm 57, the wife is 54, no kids or grandkids.Frankly we thought the movie was really enjoyable, but we tried to see it through the eyes of innocence. There were some parts I actually got a laugh out of, even at my age. I loved the part where it was announced to congratulate a dog on his son, son, daughter, daughter, son, daughter.....just one of those clever parts that you have to pay attention to catch.I loved the opening credits and Shirley Bassey theme, straight from James Bond and very clever.Sometimes we need a change from the movies we watch. Movies are so much more than cutting up teenagers in slasher movies, or great American movies like Platoon where a young girl is raped by Americans, or the great Spielberg in his Saving Private Ryan where American soldiers shoot German soldiers who are trying to surrender. No, there wasn't any 'f' bombs, nobody was in a nude scene, nobody was decapitated, nobody cheated on their spouses. You know the types of movies adults enjoy.Yes, there are times I wish to watch a racy movie or a war movie, however this was not one of those times. The wife and I desired a cute movie that anybody of any age could watch, and this movie was one of those.Real quickly, I fell asleep during the original Cats and Dogs, but this movie hooked me from the first and wouldn't let me off the hook. The original lost me in the first 10 minutes."
tt1287468,"I repeat: This is a CHILDREN'S MOVIE!!There's a lot of up and down votes on something that really wasn't meant for critically snarky 30-somethings. Get a grip!The First Movie was interesting because the concept of our pets being part of shadow spy organizations that stayed out of human sight was an eye-opener. Following up on the initial break-out is always an up-hill slog.This one was Okay. Crazed Cat Villain attempts to take over the world by making all dogs go crazy so humans will put them all into kennels. Both Canine and Feline Organizations get together to prevent disaster. what follows is EASY and ENTERTAINING to a Child. . .Repeat: 'Entertaining to a Child', not someone's Little Genius who reads the New York Times for Bedtime Stories!The references and gags put in for the accompanying adults are there to LIGHTLY ENTERTAIN us by eliciting Pun-Groans or soft snickers. They ARE NOT trying to give you a Comedy Central Sidetrack. The Adult is NOT the Target Audience here. If they did that, IT WOULD NOT BE A KID MOVIE ANYMORE!Personally, I groaned at the Batman/Joker redux of Kitty Galore. Then I smiled at the Dangerous Kitty doing the Silence of the Lambs sendup.And the rest of the time, I just sat back and enjoyed a rambunctious, Tom & Jerry style action romp simply because I wanted to be entertained by something lighthearted.And the Pigeon was a Hoot!Simply put: A good clean Movie for Little Kids that won't put the adult to sleep. Or even if you don't have Kids, and you want something light and silly to watch that doesn't require thought, this is an easy choice. Enough said."
tt1287468,"I ended up seeing this film twice in the theaters. More on that in a minute.This film made me realize, after seeing Beverly Hills Chihuaha, and Marmaduke, that ""talking animal movies"" is a sign of poor poor quality in films. They know that kids, and their parents, will be willing to pay and suffer through almost anything if it has a cute wise-cracking dog or cat character.This movie sets a new standard for the worst of a genre, however. It really has nothing to do with the first film, and has a number of dated James Bond based gags that just fall flat. Some great talent went into the voices here, but those actors and actresses (I'm talking to you, Bette Midler and William Macy) should be ashamed of themselves."
tt2287851,"This film was thrown together in 14 days and looks it. Scrambled narration, little character development, and completely different from the actual plane crashes the film claims to represent, not least of which are only a handful to no survivors in the actual tragedies. Have no idea why this film was even made."
tt2287851,This is a bad soap opera pretending to be an air flight disaster thriller. Don't waste your time.
tt2287851,"I am baffled that Netflix would subject its audience to this kind of low budget rubbish.The script is boring and without substance, the main theme of the movie doesn't start until the last 20 minutes of the film. The main theme, i.e. the crash and events leading up to it, were rushed and offered no details on how the crew handled the issue - I certainly hope that the Dana crew were a little more proactive than these two. The pilot uniforms looked like they were made by a toddler, the epaulets looked were yellow tape glued on top of black tape - really?, the director couldn't be bothered to borrow some epaulets or even a uniform from a line pilot. The whole thing is amateurish. Any High School film student or Youtuber would make a better film than this abhorrent junk."
tt2287851,"Netflix has recently been airing interesting foreign films, but they're really scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one. The obviously low-rent execution of this film doesn't bother me very much, but the horrid script and wildly uneven acting does.This film is ostensibly about an airplane crash, but aside from the first 5 minutes and the last 20, it's actually a badly scripted and unevenly acted chamber drama with serious pacing problems. The plot aimlessly meanders between the personal lives of various characters, most of which are so uninteresting that the film feels far longer than its brief 75 minutes (a problem compounded by too many pointless establishing shots of aircraft taxiing - we already know we're at an airport!). The main actors do a good job, but the script often has them prattling aimlessly; minor characters are mere sketches, and many of the performances are cringe-worthy. Speaking of cringing, the attempts at comic relief are so unfunny that I'm unsure whether to even describe them as such, and it's obvious that the filmmakers knew almost nothing about how airliners actually operate.This film would have been much better had it focused on the crash and on the embezzlement subplot. Attention low-budget filmmakers: in most cases, it's best to choose one interesting idea and focus on that."
tt2287851,"I was relieved to see the film was in English language although it was not an Anglo-Saxon film.I found the film very misogynistic to be honest - to the point of being very embarrassing. It is true that Women are routinely treated like this and everyone is happy with it?The acting was what Brits would call ""Ham acting"" (no idea why) which means kind of amateur or not great acting.All in all I have seen worse films. Dont plan your night around this - but if you cant be bothered looking for something else then this may fill a gap in your schedule.I have to add this last sentence for IMDB to accept my entry. I hope its now over 600 chts."
tt2287851,Was this what a good movie looked like in Africa in 2012? If so then ... it was great! I have to wonder (in that case) if it's gotten any better in 2021? Guess I've been so spoiled with American crappy movies that my expectations have been skewed. Perhaps the two cultures are permanently unique.
tt2287851,A plane crash made around the fate and lives of different people. I would say it's not bad at all.
tt2255934,Too long and uneven pacing weren't helped by a problematic script. That said we really enjoyed our first look at this really popular actress and the view of how Northern Indians view Tamils. The dance numbers are great and we never laughed harder than at the little fantasy where the romantic lead gassed up the motorcycle. Some things work in every culture.
tt2255934,"First of all, let me say that Rani Mukerji is just phenomenal. She is capable of a wide array of roles, and she proves it yet again. However, even her presence does not make this film watchable. The script is horrible, the dialogues are cringeworthy, jokes are painful to hear and at times the scenes are stretched too long for their own good. The movie is a solid 2 and a half hours long, where it shouldn't have been more than 2 hours, even with all the songs. The loudness and over-acting by most actors also works against the movie. It seems like everyone tries extremely hard to make you laugh, including the scriptwiter who has added scenes in the film that have nothing to do with the story. The item songs done by Rani are small moments of relief in otherwise unbearable film. And in fact, that was the main reason for me to watch this movie in the first place. Prithviraj does not get a good start in Bollywood here, but he does well for his small and mostly non-talking role. My vote for this movie is, 3 out of 10 - 1 star indicating the movie is awful (because there is no 0 in IMDb) 1 star for Rani's presence 1 star for the rare moments where the movie makes senseMy recommendation is that if you must watch this movie, make sure you watch it with no expectations whatsoever. You'll be able to tolerate it better."
tt2255934,This is supposed to be Rani Mukheji's comeback movie after a few flops. Story concentrated only to show only Rani. Nice attempt has been made to make a great movie. Presented very differently but may be the viewers are not ready to accept this kind of movie. I won't say that I didn't like the movie but not everyone will like this kind of movie and this can go down in history as a very nice experiment gone wrong.Just one song is worth humming and it had topped all charts during that time too. It was a craze among the kids. Rani has done pretty well. Rani's brother played by Amey Wagh; The role of Madhav played by Subodh Bhave is exceedingly real and played his character very well. Maina played by Anita Date looks as nasty as she was supposed to be.In all a one time watch.
tt2255934,"Promoted as a fun filled love story mixing the Maharashtrian and South Indian backdrops, AAIYYA was also considered to be the comeback film for Rani Mukherjee returning after a long gap. But the promos were not able to generate the right amount of curiosity as there was a clearly visible loud kind of effort put in by Rani herself in all those sensual dance numbers using some new distorted words. Moreover the promotional campaign was safely stressing too much on ""The Dirty Picture"" style of strategy to bring in a wider base of audience which didn't really work as expected.Therefore if studied from that angle AIYYAA can also be taken as one of the after effects of ""The Dirty Picture"" which was not a good choice of subject by its makers. Actually TDP worked majorly due to its novelty factor, full of boldness which is difficult to click again in a second similar attempt. So, where the catchy songs of AIYYAA, sound great when played in the DJ dance parties, the same is not the result when we see them on the screen coming in as the usual fillers.The film offers a good enjoyable 20-25 minutes in the start, when all the characters are being introduced and the narration seems to be fresh as well as interesting. But after those initial fine moments, the viewers keep waiting for some entertaining twists or sequences in its basic storyline which refuse to come and it all goes on at a very uneasy pace. As a result, all those weird but amusing mannerisms of its various characters gradually turn into repetitive, ridiculous and irritating leading to an avoidable mess.Being an experienced professional, Rani Mukherjee works hard for her unusual role and she does well too to portray the character in the best possible manner with a little over-acting where ever required. But she also looks a complete misfit in few songs and her sniffing act starts getting on your nerves after a while. Frankly, I also found the same quite odd & silly, since Rani is purely in love with just the smell of Prithviraj in the whole film, without knowing anything about him or his nature personally. And if that was an innovative idea thrown in, then it was certainly a first on the screen, thoughtfully penned by the writers literally going out of the box. May be, the phrase ""Love is Blind"" should be now replaced with a new one saying ""Love is Smelly"" – courtesy AIYYAA.The male lead, Prithviraj, the actor from South is impressive in his silent act (wherein he only gets to speak towards the end) and so is Subodh Bhave as the official fiancé. But there are more than one hamming stars in the rest of the cast lead by the actors playing Rani's parents, brother and grandmother. And on top of all is the girl playing Rani's office colleague, posing as the Indian Lady GaGa. The writing is quite patchy since there is no clear indication of what Rani actually wants to become in her real life as per her ambition shown in the first scene. Her passion for films and the dream of becoming a heroine suddenly takes a back seat once the love story starts off and then she is only interested in getting married and nothing else.But despite of all the above mentioned flaws, the film continues to hold some ground until a sick song ""Izzat Paapad"" suddenly breaks in all of a sudden and ruins it completely. It simply pulls the film down in the bracket of below average ventures and the viewer starts looking left & right like a lost person. Further it goes on a stretching mode offering a pretty weak, lackluster climax without any exciting or entertaining moments which force you to just leave the theater at once without any further thinking.As a matter of fact, AIYYAA talks about some strange characters coming from the imagination of director Sachin Kundalkar who remains drowned in his own world or script, forgetting the truth that the film was basically being made for the viewers alone. His unconventional and uninteresting narration not only lets down the hearty effort ofRani Mukherjee but it also affects the brand name of Anurag Kashyap presenting the film as a producer.In all, few enjoyable tracks of Amit Trivedi and a passionate performance of Rani Mukherjee are the only two merits in AIYYAA. And if these two excite you well, then do watch it in the theater or else wait for its DVD release in the next few weeks."
tt2255934,"One of the worse films I've seen. Over 2 and a half hours of mental torture. Throughout the entirety of the film, the story goes nowhere. No story, no humour and definitely not even a tad bit of entertainment. To sum up this is an awful film which at the very best deserves a rating of zero.I would have been happy to include a synopsis of the story or include a guideline on the characters of this film, however there's nothing to write. Its a film without a script and I honestly wonder what the point was in making this film.Avoid this one anyhow. I would stay away from it had I known better."
tt2255934,"A fine actress though she is, seems to be now gripped with insecurity with a sagging career line. why else she would do a movie like Aaiyya !?. I have not been able to find a word to term this movie, as it fits into no category. 'Bad' is too good, 'Immature' is not appropriate for some one like Anurag Kashyap. I can not say anything about the story, as I could not sit thru more than twenty minute of the movie. Rani's performance seemed novice, may be it was because performance of the rest was so bad Rani had to DE-perform to match ! A howling granny trying to act chick, a mother trying to hold the controlling rein over the family, a moronic father fumbling with telephones, a brother trying to be funny all the time and a transvestite looking thing with no relation to the story make a jokers ensemble.Why and how we have a hordes of eligible bachelors who are all imbeciles is beyond me. Over all this movie not even worth wasting the time trying to write a review, let alone seeing it. So just avoid"
tt2255934,"'Aiyyaa' is a film that redefines zany, whacky, and crazy, or should I instead say 'Wakra'? It's leading lady – a librarian in an Art College in real, and a Bollywood Diva in her fantasies - Meenakshi (played uninhibitedly by Rani Mukherjee) and her acute sense of smell and by connection, unfathomable attraction to the tall, dark, and handsome art student Surya (a delightful Bollywood debut by Malyalam star Prithviraj Sukumaran) and maddeningly Bollywood fantasies drive not only her, but also those around oscillating between sanity and the puerile.Be it her motor mouth mother who keeps laughing and telling all and sundry about how perfect a bride her daughter will be, her father, surrounded by innumerable mostly dysfunctional telephones who has the quirky habit of smoking 4 cigarettes at the same time, her jobless class 10 failed brother 'Nanu' who loves dogs and is dogged in his hate for humanity, or last but not the least, her blind grandmother with her golden dentures who keeps zipping around the house in a motorized wheelchair and passes expert comments on everything.Add to that a crazy co-worker 'Mayna' who is a cross between Lady Gaga and Bugs Bunny. Be it her crazy Lady Gaga inspired dressing, bad Bollywood dancing, maddening fondness for John Abraham, or overall behavior with those around her. She really is as whacky, if not more than Meenakshi's family.The only sane person in her life is her forced fiancé – Madhav Rajadhyaksha (played aptly by Marathi actor Subodh Bhave) whose logicality almost threatens to overpower the smelly attraction Meenakshi has for Surya. And therein lies a terrible tale.This is a classic example of too many ingredients confusing the cook. For, while several sequences stand out for their whacky quotient, the overall picture is one of incoherence. The story and plot are as weak as Meenakshi's knees every time she spots Surya. The funny lines, superb acting, excellent choreography, and beautiful music are somehow thrust at the background every time you desperately hope and wish to hear the mostly silent Surya speak. His body however speaks, rather screams, every time he enters a fantastical dream of Meenakshi and ends up displaying some groovy dancing, a chiseled body complimented by a shaved chest, and six pack abs that stand out in stark contrast to his unkempt chest hair ravaged painter avatar in the real portions. But for the most part your heart might actually go out to the more earthy suitor of Meenakshi with his love for the kind of romance exemplified by Farroukh Sheikh and Deepti Naval.If you shirk your nose every time you catch a rerun of MTV Fully Faltoo, this film might be the smelliest thing to have entered your nostrils. If a great story and plot are those that drive you, this film is likely to be a huge let down. But if you are one of those who are ready for some zany humor, this indeed might be the film to catch. Though a better script/story/plot rounded with some crisp editing would have done this film a world of good, it stills holds its ground for several reasons. Watch it for its characters, presentation, dialogues and crazy sense of humor (thanks to National Award winning director Sachin Kundalkar), whacky lyrics (Amitabh Bhattacharya), fantastic music (Amit Trivedi), exuberant choreography (Vaibhavi Merchant) and last but not the least, for Rani Mukherjee.Be it her enacting of iconic songs and dialogues of Sridevi, Madhuri, or Juhi, her attempts at learning Tamil, her overpowering melodrama about everything happening to her, and for her trio of terrific dance performances - a luscious Lavani, a Silk Smitha inspired 'Dreamup Wakeupum', or her fantastic Kamasutra inspired Belly Dancing in 'Aaga Bai'. Rani is fantastic or should be say 'Wakra'? Go decide for yourself."
tt2255934,"I don't understand how one can think like Rani Mukharji. she thinks it can be her comeback movie. I am sure if Rani ll be on her top at the time movie released, it ll have the same impact on box office as well as people. it is a total waste movie. You ll hit your head on wall after watching this.you must be wondering about the movie title 'Aiyaa'. how did it come. when man want to see Rani Mukharji to meet at her house. at time time Rani made surprise disappoint expression with word 'Aiyaa'. and thats the name of movie.now come to the acting , Rani hadn't done justice with the role. its seems like overacting all the times.So if you want to sleep and you don't have sleeping pills, I am recommending his/her to watch this movie."
tt2255934,"Meenakshi is so real,she portrays any gal's dilemma of pursuing inner desires vs choosing a life which is practical and realistic. except for the raunchy numbers, this movie is a beautiful. the songs seems like they were added for the masses otherwise its a very well written and directed story. i love the chemistry between meenakshi and surya . her helplessness in expressing her true intent was portrayed very well by Rani Mukerji. i like prithviraj and i would watch this again for him."
tt2255934,"There are some completely cringe-worthy things about this film, notably certain supporting characters and the Benny Hill style speeded up action. After 15 minutes, I paused it to see what IMDB had to say. 4.4 stars. I've never watched a movie with less than 5 stars, and only a few under 6. Nevertheless, I decided to perserve. I'm glad I did. I truly enjoyed the musical numbers, done mostly in colorful Indian style clothing (as opposed to the ""urban"" look that is showing up in Bollywood), and Ms. Mukerji was a delight. She completely carried the movie, almost by herself. The ending was quite worth waiting for, and Im glad I did. 6.5 stars."
tt2255934,"Sadly, the movie doesn't fulfill at least the satisfactory kind of expectations. All the elements in this boring flick adds up to ennui- generating claptrap and Rani Mukherji has totally lost it!What was the director even thinking during the making? The writer needs to take a reality check and every other factor in this cinema is rubbish.South star Prithviraj was completely wasted, having seen almost all his Malayalam movies. His first ever dialog in the movie comes after about 2 hours, near to the climax sequence. Furthermore, in the entire movie, he just had one expression in his face, moves around and does nothing extraordinary.On the whole, this mixture of Misal Payasam and Idli Dosappam is unhappily avoidasm. Prithviraj, if not for his bod, is out of Bollywwod. So should Rani! :DCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES. But, you shouldn't!Language: No | Sex: No | Foreplay: No | Violence: No | Smoking & Alcohol: Strong | Nudity: Very mild"
tt2255934,this movie is bad... real bad .Dunno why some people have posted excellent reviews..may be those comments are from Rani Muk. herself...as no one in their real / normal mind will like this bakwaas...If you have watched preview / trailer of this movie.. thats all you need to watch as those are the only good scenes in movie.. rest everything is pure junk...if you still wanna waste 2+hrs of your life... then a big Good luck with that ...trust me it does not even deserve 1* ratings...
tt2255934,"Had seen the songs, which are quite well done. Thought ""how bad could it really be""... So got hold of a copy and decided to watch it one weekend. First half goes OK, not brilliant but still bearable.Second half goes downhill faster than a lorry with buggered brakes. Last half an hour makes you want to shoot yourselfTruly awful movie. On the upside I will no longer have think when asked ""what is the worst movie you have ever seen in your whole life""It as if they put a team of artists together and said to them, lets make a movie that will take the world record the most ridiculous and mind-numbing show ever made and then dump all over it."
tt2255934,"First up, thanks to IMDb to enable its reviewers to give a 1 star rating to movies. If they could get any lower, I wudn't hesitate in giving it a 0.5 star. Secondly, I thank my stars for not watching this stupid movie in a movie hall although I had half a mind of doing it when it released. This could have been a good movie given the basic idea of the plot and the talent of Rani Mukherjee. But seriously, what was she thinking while signing up for it? She is already at the fading end of her career and such choices are obviously not doing her any good. The movie is just full of unwanted characters, over the top effort to make some parts funny, patchy editing and too many ideas to fit in a 2.5 hour long movie. its a showcase of the makers getting confused at every juncture and giving a completely erratic output. C'mon there are loads of amazing movies out there based on the common middle class family depicting their life (and dreams/nightmares)in a good way. All said and done, it wud still be better if there was more of a story build up between the leads (rather than Rani's brother finding her soul mate equally abruptly) and an alternate ending to the movie. And Rani, please don't try songs like Creamingum, Wakeupam, Birha Saudai etc. again.. everyone is not Vidya Balan."
tt2255934,"There was a time in the early '2k era' when an actress was slowly making a mark in Indian cinema. She was small, impish, vigorously spontaneous and ever charming. Her crackling voice appeared unpleasant initially leading filmmakers like Mahesh Bhatt to dub someone else for her. However, like a true talent would, she turned every scar to star. Rani Mukherjee, the actress with all her effervescence was missing all this while from the silver screen, she made her fans wait and grumble. However, the wait was worth!! With ""Aiyaa"", Rani is rightfully ""back with a bang"". She rants, she banters, she raves and she rules!!! Meenakshi Deshpande (Rani Mukherjee) loves to dream herself as Madhuri Dixit, Sridevi and Juhi Chawla (the ladies who ruled Indian cinema in the 90's). She idolizes them...but wait, she is not a wannabe actress, she simply loves to dream! A typical 'teenage Bollywood freak' at heart, Meenakshi's dreams are pompous, opulent and larger-than-life, no matter how diminutive her real life existence is. While her parents almost hound for a suitable match for her, she secretly nourishes the idea of eloping with her boyfriend by taking away all her grand ma's assorted jewellery. A secret wish to fall in love and get rid of the 'ever-so-mundane' ways of life is all that she wants. The movie begins by elucidating upon the innuendos of this freaky, simple yet vivacious Marathi mulgi. Meenakshi's dream is perhaps every (middle class) girl's dream and this is where an instant connection takes place between the audience and the gripping narrative of this girl.Rani Mukherjee with all her gusto gives a live wire performance as Meenakshi on-screen.Before one could settle down with the vibrancy of this girl, another aspect about her comes to surface. Meenakshi is hyper-sensitive to 'smell' in general. The municipality dustbin is just a stone's throw from her house. She is agitated, screams and rants about it all the day. Feels stifled almost every time she passes by it and gets nauseated by its foulness. However, the fragrance of dreams never ceases to grasp her. The bin here works as a complete metaphor to showcase the innate quality of this girl to live life just the way she wants to!The story develops further. Meenakshi eventually manages a job as a librarian in an art college and consequently feels a magnetic pull towards an art student there for the ""heavenly"" smell that he emanates. Is it the perennial stingy smell that she has to bear with back home which makes her so drawn towards this ""out-of the world"" smell of this man? We ponder! Prithviraj, I was told is a South superstar. He absolutely lives up to the expectations in the film. Super dashing as he looks on screen, his contemplative face as an artist is a ""countenance to reckon with"", so much so that Meenakshi eventually falls head-over-heels in love with him and so does most of the girls in the audience! (I included)Like her dreams Meenakshi follows him almost everywhere. She goes all out of her way to learn Tamil. She barges into the men's toilet, gatecrashes into his house as a sales woman and secretly steals his shirt only to wear it in the night and feel closer to his 'existence'. The longing to be with the beloved can also be satiated by wearing his clothes, his belongings and their remnants. A beautiful expression indeed!!Gyrating dance moves and raunchy make-ups are nothing but an expression of her fantasies that plummets the moment real life strikes.Meenakshi's marriage gets apparently fixed up with the 'Farooque Sheikh' admirer Madhav which she couldn't impede even after a forceful horrendous rendition of a Tamil song. She continually follows her dream man who is continually oblivious about her. Meenakshi pulls out all the stops to follow him for an entire day and escapes from her pending engagement. She finally meets him eventually discovers the reason for the heavenly smell that pulls her.... Almost a fairytale story told in a fairytale fashion, 'Aiyaa' wins your heart with its softness, unique expression of love and ever so pure ""smell"" factor attached to it. What is it, other than the looks, which make a person different from the others externally? Smell right? No two individual can smell the same technically. The director harps on this fact and colors it with all the possible shades of romance. The intensity of a person's body, the feeling of getting attached with him by inhaling that fragrance..emotions become almost palpable at the very realization of it all!! 'Aiyaa' other than being a fun to watch movie is also very profound in the message it inadvertently conveys. With some comic relief in the form of the 'golden tooth of the grand ma' and Meenakshi's pro-PETA brother (which I honestly feel the script did not need at all), the film fulfills all the quotients of entertainment. After Sridevi's powerful performance in English Vinglish, its Rani's exuberance that comes our way this time round. What a treat for movie buffs! Much like Sridevi's Shashi, who ends up completely transforming herself as an expert in English, Rani's Meenakshi too coverts from speaking ""aiyaa"" to ""aaiyo"". She meets her dream man finally and becomes ""Meenakshi Deshpande Iyer"".P.S- Extra ordinary dance prowess showcased by Rani (especially the belly dance). Beautiful movie, must watch!!"
tt2255934,"Aiyyaa was a major critical and financial failure, but having seen the nice trailer and liked it, and considering the fact that Rani Mukherjee is in it, I most willingly decided to watch it. I personally found Aiyya to be thoroughly enjoyable. It is a slightly mad but totally relatable comic ride which is well written and acted and which has plenty of great moments. The humour is indeed very different from what we are used to watching in the usual Bollywood fare, and the basic concept of a woman just going 'aiyyaa' over a stranger whose mysterious fragrance attracts her the most may be quite weird at points. But, it is this very premise which makes this little film ever more unique and funny. The film is portrayed rather realistically, with the sets, costumes and dialogue giving it an engaging sense of everyday simplicity, while being consistently humorous. The portrayal of Meenakshi's Marathi family is very amusing, and the songs are quite fun to watch. Aiyyaa's biggest strength, however, is the portrayal of its main character; Meenakshi finds a way to deal with her everyday troubles through the power of the imagination. She creates her own perfect, spiritual world, using her dreams without really losing herself. In this regard, Aiyyaa works as a mini-celebration of the human spirit.All of this, however, wouldn't have been the same without the wonderful presence of Rani Mukherjee. Mukherjee is a true delight in this film. Her last great performance was in a minuscule part in Saawariya, and it's been ages since we've seen her really immerse herself into a character, as she does here. As Meenakshi, she is hilarious and at times just borderline self-deprecatory. It is this uninhibited, fearless quality that makes this comic performance work so well. Her dance numbers, needless to say, are brilliant and she looks a million bucks in each one of them. South Indian actor Prithviraj is for the most part a mere presence on-screen, but he does pretty well and is good foil for Mukherjee. The other members of the cast are all very good and turn in nice and funny acts. Towards the end the film provides us with some of its most beautiful sequences. The climactic scenes are very surprising and the ending is unexpected and rewarding. This is also the opportunity to note the excellent cinematography, and the amazing background score, which enhance the narrative. Aiyyaa is an absolute laugh riot which has been misunderstood and rejected by critics and audiences just for the wrong reasons. I liked it, and would definitely recommend it to Hindi film buffs."
tt2255934,"OK, this is a goofy movie (the tag line is: Go Wakda (wacky)) so if you are expecting superb entertainment, you are out of luck. But, Rani Mukerji really shines as a nut job and really makes this movie laughable fun. I vote for her to star in the next Houseful 3 as her wackiness would work well in that series. You need to appreciate the wacky humor that comes with the Golmaal, Houseful, or Masti/Grand Masti series to enjoy his one. If that is not your style of humor, look elsewhere. Meenakshi's family is truly dysfunctional and adds to the humor. Meenaski's friend and co-worker Mynah comes across as an Indian Lady Gaga and is somewhat funny, but a little annoying at times. When Meenakshi dreams about being her favorite actresses is probably the funniest parts, so it helps to have a good background on some older Bollywood hits and veteran actresses to get a laugh at those scenes. The music is catchy, though some of the dance sequences are a bit risqué which is slightly unusual for Rani. Nothing terrible, but slightly not family safe for younger members. Prithviraj's character is played well especially in the end. Not a hit, but good goofy fun if you are looking for a good laugh."
tt2255934,The movie might not work for you the first time you watch it but watch each character closely and you will sense their individuality through the comedy that is wacky & unusual..the film is full timmmmeeee passsss!
tt2255934,"It was Times of India that voted this one amongst the worst movies of 2012 and it didn't get a lot of love in the reviews either. I am surprised about that. Rani Mukerji is one of my favourite actresses in general. Her comic talent is phenomenal. As a dreaming librarian who smells the world, sees through the eyes of a romantic movie and lives amongst a range of quirky but adorable characters she reminds me of an Indian Amelie poulain. Menakshi is a little awkward, carefree and full of good intentions with an indestructible faith in the power of love.Of course the story is nothing new and for Non-Indians it might be a little over the top.There are a few characters the film could do with out for sure, one being the librarian and Menakhis colleague. She brings the rating down with at least 2 points on IMDb. How did they come up with the idea to pair the lovely Rani with this creepy caricature?) But when you take that lightly you want to follow Mukerji's Meenakshi in her pursuit for love and the adventures of her chaotic family are worth every minute of your time."
tt2298738,"Without prior knowledge of the story (the book), this movie doesn't really make a lot of sense: the characters actions seem to be slightly deranged and pointless, nothing gets explained but only hinted at through dreamy monologues and flashbacks. The dialogues suffer from the very same vague disease and even though the acting is good, the plot feels silly and the characters mentally unstable for the most part. Visually speaking it's very appealing, save for the female protagonist's look and makeup that feel too strong and modern and don't match with the general vibe. I will try to watch another adaptation of the same story."
tt2298738,"So this is the first feature film from the recently started production company ""Hat on Lady"" and its owner Mattias Dimfelt. It's not easy making a movie when you haven't done one before so for a first, this one holds up pretty good. The movie is also quite nice to look at with some really enjoyable outdoor shots of Skottorp outside of Laholm in Halland, Sweden. The movie is loosely based on the classical play by the Swedish writer August Strindberg ""Fröken Julie"" which centers around the complicated love-story between the rich upper-class woman Julie and the servant Jean.I have to commend the movie makers for daring to mix up relatively unknown actors with more famous and established ones. This is something I hardly ever see in films from Sweden where the former hardly ever gets the chance to play a leading roll right off the bat. In Fröken Julie tough this is the case.The ""new"" ones I'm talking about is Nathalie Söderqvist as ""Julie"" and Klas Ekegren as ""Jean"". They've both come from the world of theater, drama and films but are hardly known at all in Sweden. The more known, established ones are Görel Crona and Lina Englund and even tough Nathalie and Klas do OK I must say that the favorite performance for me personally was given by Lina Englund who's poor, Christian serving girl comes off as the most genuine and real. The score from Mark Ambervill must also not be forgotten. It sounds great and manages to not only capture the ""feel"" of the film but also gives it a bigger impact. Also the camera crew shooting and making this movie consisted mostly of film students aged 18 to 25 making their very first feature film and it looks just as professionally made as any other movie.To conclude, for anyone who's ever been captivated by the Swedish writer August Strindberg's classical story of Julie and Jean this movie offers a different perspective which is well worth the watch."
tt3685624,"Although it seems like a new and different proposal, it ends up falling into the most common clichés in Mexican films. The main plot is not very well defined, and whatever it was, it ends up being slow and cheesy, it has many unnecessary scenes that do not add anything to the story, some performances are bad, several things are not funny, the love story does not develop . Some characters are poorly written, they even seem like extras, despite that it becomes entertaining, has a good message about following your passions and is not so absurd.I think that it is highly overrated by the public since everything that happens in the film seems indifferent to me. Simply boring."
tt3685624,"The movie is the remake of 3 idiots but not very lengthy . It is of 1.48hr not bad but also not good. Good music , come to age movie, watch this to your children but there is some comedy which are not comedy but it is unsuitable for child. Some not more. Watch the film. Not worst,not best. Medium."
tt3685624,"Bad copy of a great Indian movie. The same recycled actors and actress. The same cheap humor of ""the new Mexican cinema""Please, if you're of another country don't think that Mexicans are as weak as this movie in every sense is.It's sad because there are a lot of talented young people in my country wishing an opportunity to do something new, but in México all of what matters is the money"
tt3685624,"Good try for remake 1×movie but original is 100×movie
I am Indian and all Indian 80% people favourite movie 🍿"
tt3685624,"In general, this film seems an episode of a corny soap opera, at least a well made one, the message they seek to give to the viewer is invaluable. Unfortunately the story wasn't developed in the best way.Anyway I will give it six stars for the pretty woman. Have fun watching it guys!"
tt3685624,"I saw the film this past weekend in Austin, Texas with my gal who is from Honduras and the theater had quite a few Espanol speakers in the audience and everyone liked it. It has laughs, seriousness, and sadness and love moments in the script, and I thought the actors did a good job. Who cares if it is a remake? It was made to appeal to a Latin American audience. I think Lionsgate made a wise decision in distributing this film to an American audience, obviously they see something in the film that other critics do not. Do not be swayed by negative criticism and go enjoy the movie, I know I did, and I lived in Chihuahua, Mexico for two years and I am a Gringo and I do not think it is a substandard film from Mexico or a waste of money at all. Go see it and you be the judge."
tt3685624,"Congrats guys, well done! Perfect acting for the title and story of the movie. No other actor would have done a great job as your guys. Adding it to my collection!"
tt3685624,"At its core, ""3 Idiotas"" revolves around the reunion of three college friends-Pancho (Alfonso Dosal), Felipe (Christian Vazquez), and Beto (German Valdez). The narrative unfolds as they embark on a road trip in search of their long-lost friend, Chava (Paulina Davila), who disappeared years ago. The journey becomes a catalyst for self-discovery and a reflection on the unorthodox philosophy imparted by their absent friend during their college days.One of the film's strengths lies in its ability to balance humor with poignant social commentary. The comedic elements are skillfully woven into the narrative, providing lighthearted moments that resonate with the audience. The chemistry among the lead actors, particularly Dosal, Vazquez, and Valdez, contributes significantly to the film's charm, making their camaraderie both believable and endearing.Bolado's direction breathes new life into the familiar narrative, infusing it with vibrant Mexican cultural references. The picturesque landscapes and vibrant cinematography enhance the visual appeal, creating a cinematic experience that is both visually engaging and emotionally resonant. The decision to adapt the story to a Mexican context adds layers to the narrative, making it relatable to a broader audience while retaining the essence of the original material.The film's exploration of the pressure and expectations associated with the education system is particularly relevant. Through the characters' experiences in college, ""3 Idiotas"" delves into the societal demands placed on individuals to conform to traditional paths of success. The critique of a rigid education system that prioritizes grades over holistic learning is conveyed with humor and sensitivity, prompting viewers to reflect on their own perceptions of success and happiness.The character dynamics are a highlight of the film. Pancho's rebellious spirit, Felipe's pursuit of artistic passion, and Beto's comedic innocence create a trio that embodies the spirit of non-conformity. Each character undergoes significant growth throughout the journey, and their individual arcs contribute to the overarching theme of self-discovery and authenticity.The film also introduces a love story that adds a layer of emotion to the narrative. Chava's character serves as a symbol of pursuing one's dreams against societal expectations, and her relationship with Pancho adds a poignant element to the storyline. The romantic subplot is delicately handled, complementing the broader themes of the film without overshadowing the central focus on friendship and self-realization.Musically, the film embraces a vibrant soundtrack that complements the narrative. The use of music, including popular Mexican tracks, enhances the cultural resonance of the film and contributes to the overall atmosphere. The soundtrack not only accompanies the characters' journey but also becomes a character in itself, evoking a range of emotions that enrich the viewing experience.In conclusion, ""3 Idiotas"" (2017) successfully adapts the core elements of the original narrative into a Mexican context, delivering a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. Bolado's direction, coupled with the stellar performances of the cast, brings a fresh perspective to the timeless themes of friendship, individuality, and the pursuit of one's passions. The film's ability to seamlessly blend humor with social commentary makes it a standout contribution to the cinematic landscape, resonating with audiences who appreciate a heartfelt and culturally resonant story."
tt4590256,This movie is an insult to 'She's All That'.The movie is so bad that it's ridiculous to even call it a 'movie'.It's ironic that the actors and actresses in the movie represent in their real lives everything the movie criticizes.I have to watch the 'She's All That' DVD this weekend.
tt4590256,"As an adult I should not have watched this movie, to a young person it might have been tolerable and relevant. However, in my opinion it was painful. The acting was stiff and the actors had no chemistry. The storyline was expected, but some really laughable moments - prom dance off? Is that even a thing?"
tt4590256,The reviews are more entertaining than the movie. That's my review.
tt4590256,"I cringed so hard that my soul climbed out of my body and now I'm doomed to roam the earth as a ghost, cringing for all eternity."
tt4590256,"What was this movie? Didn't even make sense one bit. Terrible acting from Addison. The scene transitions, the angles, the story line, the gen Z infested bs & the random dance off lmao.. it was a hot mess!!! I was looking forward to this all week and it was a big let down. DO NOT WATCH."
tt4590256,"This movie is so bad. TBH, it doesn't even feel like a movie, it's just like some type of a vlog or school project. The acting, especially Addison Rae's, is terrible. Everything else - extremely cringe and awkward. Zero chemistry, weird camera angles... Just watch anything else instead."
tt4590256,"I watched the movie with my kids. It was cute and had a message. Why is everyone expecting Oscar worthy performances here? Relax. Not something I would have watched on my own but enjoyable for teenagers. There is a little cursing, but teens curse. Deal."
tt4590256,"Apparently everyone can act, honestly start looking for talented actors instead of looking for TikTokers."
tt4590256,"Tanner Buchanan, Rachel Leigh Cook, and Matthew Lillard were the best parts of this movie. Tanner carried the movie, everything else was sub par. Note to Hollywood, TikTok star doesn't equal good female lead."
tt4590256,"Matthew Lillard was better in the 10 minutes he was around then all the other ""teens"" through the rest of the movie.I went into this with low expectations and was still disappointed. It was good if you wanted a braindead watch but the ending with the horse.... god so cringe.The writing and acting were horrendous. The two original actors carried every scene they were in with the exception of the little sister."
tt4590256,"I gained too much knowledge from my Physics lecture that I was stressed and always had headaches. However when I watched this movie I slowly felt my IQ oozing out of my brain as my brain neurons begged for help, I now live in a cave den in Southwestern Ethiopia and has to forage rocks and discarded animals corpses to survive."
tt4590256,I'll admit this movie did get a bit cliche at times but it wasn't bad. It felt like I was watching a Disney movie. I do like the message of the movie and the chemistry between the actors was great. I do recommend if you want a cute and cheesy love story.
tt4590256,"Holy cow this movie is terrible.Between being rushed, terrible dialogue, and no chemistry between the characters.. Product placement and the couple big names in the movie are the only way this thing was made. Its basically a parody of She's All That. When will society learn that not everyone that gets famous on social media has actual talent?"
tt4590256,"Bad dialogue, unrealistic reactions, cringe all the way, way too much product placements. Was this written and directed by a teenager?"
tt4590256,"The whole movie all I could see was sponsors. The water, pop corn, chips, drinks.... You name it. The movie sucked I thought it would be way more fun and I found myself not impressed at all."
tt4590256,"First let me say, I had no idea who the lead was. Five minutes into the movie I was beyond frustrated; who is this female lead and why do her acting skills remind me of a local waitress auditioning for a milk ad in the 1960s? Then I looked the cast and boom, it all made sense. I should've expected nothing less. This movie had all the aspects of an unrealistic, poorly written, amateurish, predictable, high budget but with untalented casting staff movie. What's the point of saturating a movie with famous actors for views? Unfortunately I'm unable to regain the hour and half I wasted clenching my jaws, awkwardly glancing at my imaginary friends around the room as I react to every minute that passes of this movie. If I could give zero stars this movie would be a suitable place to start. Tell a friend to tell a friend, save them the future dental work....(teeth grinding)"
tt4590256,"I am too ancient it seems to know who Addison Lee is but she's no Freddie PJ. This lack of context meant I thought the bizarre hyper unrealism of her acting was going to be revealed as a plot point. What a grave misconception to imagine this film had anything like so much substance. I won't spoil anything in case anyone is mad enough to be reading these reviews and still watch, but I am about to take a long hard look in the mirror for making it through this film without throwing up.Oddly however this did pass the Kermode six laugh test for me, a one liner from an underused elderly relative woke me up and laughter of at least five times the duration emerged during the denouement. Not sure if that counts actually, please don't bother. As for the preposterous physique of the ""loser"" leading man and patronising nods towards diversity I have no words. Oh a kardashian pops up."
tt4590256,"I really don't get all the hate and bad reviews. Was it corny? Yes! Was it predictable? Yes! But it's a teen rom-com. Every movie like this is corny and predictable lol. I feel like everyone really needs to lighten up and stop being such angry critics. If you're going into this expecting an Oscar winning film then that is your mistake right there. It's a fluff move just meant to make you smile. I thought it was adorable. None of these types of movies have the best or deepest acting skills but it was entertaining and really nicely updated to fit today's social media world. I'm a huge fan of the original and I was anticipating really hating this remake but I have to be honest I totally loved it. Good job on the story! My only critique could possibly be that everything felt a little sped up to fit into the short runtime of the film, but other than that a very cute movie. I will definitely watch this again!"
tt4590256,"Addison Rae tried method acting for this role. The method did not work.Ps, You're better off enjoying this movie with a blindfold on and the music turned up."
tt4590256,"I enjoyed this film and I've watched it twice, it's relaxing and the two lead characters have good chemistry. Addison Rae brings a lot of charisma to the role and this makes the film uplifting. The music is fun and the filming is nice to watch. The story is simple and that's what you'd want when you want to wind down. I don't really understand all the negative reviews as I found this enjoyable to watch. The outfits are interesting, there's a dance-off, singing & dancing, a sweet mother-daughter relationship and an important message about how what you see on social media doesn't always match reality. Everything you'd want in an easy-to-watch movie!"
tt4590256,Dont waste your time. It wasnt good netflix should have thought this through and should have had common sense before releasing this their target audience had to have been gen z but none of us even liked it cuz of the casting no offence.
tt4590256,Really do not understand the rating. This was a very sweet story with funny well written dialogue and appealing characters.
tt4590256,"A chick flick in nicest way i can put it. Nothing to rave about, weekend guilty pleasure. Might be a classic. Time will tell."
tt4590256,And who the hell is Addison Rae? Somebody told her she could act...and forgot to add JK.
tt5674698,"There is nothing to see here. Tried for 30 minutes, but after 30 minutes I realized that all I got is 30 minutes wasted. My advice, if you don't like the first 5 minutes, stop watching. It will be the same after 30 minutes.Too bad. I love Spanish comedies, but this is a huge fail and a waste of time."
tt7109106,"This is a situation, not a story. None of the four writers (a sign of screenplay trouble on a Dutch production), producers or director seem to have known the difference. Consequently, none of the turning points of the plot really work, including the most important one: the finale.The three stars are for production design and cinematography (despite the heave handed use of diffusion filters)."
tt7109106,"My 9 year old daugther liked it. We've laughed at Jill, that was fun. Hence the 5. And because I'm easy satisfied.
I think Jeroen Koopman whatched a little to much Mean girls when he was a little boy.
Rachel McAdams survived that movie, maybe someone from the Dutch version will..."
tt7109106,"Honestly this movie just sucks. Horrible acting by dutch influencers. The fact that all of the actors are somewhat famous in the Netherlands makes the mocie worse because you know how they act irl and it just makes me cringe how they act in the movie. Comedy is bad, the writing is horrible, and the main character is insufferable."
tt7109106,"This film is so bad I want to bleach my eyes, Nobody should watch this monstrosity"
tt7109106,I couldn't get through the first ten minutes. Dear.god.
tt7109106,"One of the best (under-rated) movies in my opinion. The directing of Edwin is amazing, and the casting crew did an perfect job. I watched this movie over twenty times, and its still not boring at all. No more words needed, 10/10."
tt7456312,"Nope, the 5th grader's screenplay would be better!""The Last Thing Anyone Wanted"" should've been the title of this film. What was seasoned writer and director Dee Rees on when she wrote and directed this, and did no one else proofread this convoluted plot ridden excuse for a screenplay?Ugggh, 2 hours of my life I'll never get back! Watch the trailer and you've seen the entire movie - and the trailer makes more sense than the movie if that tells you anything. What a waste of talented actors. A shame this will be a thorn on their resume, I hope they got paid well. NOTHING in this film made any sense. The only thing I got out of this film was to take up smoking; Hathaway was successful in advertising cigarette smoking.The only reason I'm not giving this film a 1/10 is +1 for the actors and +1 for the producers not posting fake/paid reviews - yet. Thus it's a 3/10 from me"
tt7456312,"I really wanted to like this movie because the trailer was great and it set the bar high. About a third of the way in I said to my wife, ""what the hell is going on?"" She didn't know either. Another third into the movie and I repeated the question, which went unanswered because my wife was asleep. Bored by the meandering plot lines that never seem to unite. So, I wasted a few hours of my life watching this but the good news is my wife got an hour or more of decent shut eye."
tt7456312,"Dee Rees, the director of the much acclaimed ""Mudbound"", offers up her second Netflix collaboration - ""The Last Thing He Wanted"", a crime thriller based on Joan Didion's novel of the same name. The cast includes such stars as Anna Hathaway, Willem Dafoe & Ben Affleck, also Rosie Perez and Toby Jones. What could possibly go wrong? Apparently a whole lot.""The Last Thing He Wanted"" is, in a certain way, an annoying experience. Its main strength are the acting performances, the highlights include a content and contained lead performance by Anna Hathaway and a well fitted supporting role for Willem Dafoe. Rosie Perez and Ben Affleck were good as well, but, frankly, they weren't given enough to do to really stand out. It's a mildly frustrating watch because the star-studded power seems wasted on an otherwise weak and confused movie. Or rather the story and screenplay. I can only suppose it's an unsuccessful adaptation of the aforementioned novel. Visually, ""The Last Thing He Wanted"" is shot very well (and uses a peculiar aspect ratio, but with no complaints), looks and sounds like an above average Hollywood-type thriller. But all of that only matters so much on the background of the script which feels like a lot of things and almost none of them are good - it's disjointed, unfocused, doesn't stick together, doesn't carry the weight it should (I'd take a guess though that the filmmakers think otherwise) and just disappoints altogether. While watching I felt like each scene is somehow to be taken on its own terms, every time the previous one didn't feel important much anymore. What I'm trying to say is that a rather simple story telling has gotten all tangled up here and it's a huge black shadow hovering over ""The Last Thing He Wanted"".Despite the quite enormous flaw/s, ""The Last Thing He Wanted"" possesses one or two redeeming qualities. I'll go ahead and assume, probably correctly, that this movie is going to be a bore to a lot of people, but if the viewer commits, it's possible to squeeze out an eyebrow-raising evening 5/10, which is the most I can give it with a clear conscience."
tt7456312,"I just created an account specifically for this review. That's how bad, pointless, and confusing this movie was. I felt something in my soul that said I had to let the world know.Plot: Bad/Pointless
Continuity: None
Doesn't tie everything in at any point
Feeling: Am I dumb, did I miss something, or is this movie actually this bad?This film has prompted several questions
Who OK'd this film to be released?
Will I ever forgive myself for wasting 2 hours of my life?While the answer to the first question is obviously ""an idiot"", the answer to the second question is actually ""yes!"".There's a silver lining. In wasting my time watching this film, I managed to come across film reviews and ratings of this movie afterwards. I got so much joy and laughter (which I did not receive from watching the movie) out of reading how bad the movie was that I actually am happy I watched it. For every second of misery I endured watching the movie, there was a moment of happiness reading a review of an equally disgusted viewer. The ONLY reason to watch the movie is to laugh at the reviews after!"
tt7456312,"'The Last Thing He Wanted' begins with a long narration from Anne Hathaway's character. We have no context for what she is saying, and what she is saying is so incredibly dull that it is nearly impossible to focus on what she is saying for the lengthy duration she rambles on for. This sets the tone for a truly shocking film. I can't remember the last time I saw a film so pretentious and full of itself, while concurrently being of such a low standard.Where do I begin with the faults this movie contains? The story is all over the place for starts. It darts around like a headless chook running in circles and never settles down for a moment. The movie asks you to follow every little detail hidden in the dialogue, but the dialogue is so bland and uninteresting that is an immensely tough task to do so. If you haven't completely lost interest in this film 15 minutes in then you have the patience of a saint.I looked up the book this is based on. From what I can tell people were not overly fond of this book. Which begs the question why it got a film when so many incredible books out there have failed to do so. Who read this rambling mess of a story and thought it would make for a great film? Also how did they get a cast as good as they did with a script this bad? I know Anne Hathaway and Ben Affleck's careers have fallen off a cliff, but surely not to this extent? I really did not enjoy this film and even though it's free to watch on Netflix I would suggest it is not worth your time or effort."
tt7456312,Im usually not a look at my phone while watching a movie kind of person but from the beginning of there movie I found myself looking at my phone. Buy the time out was over I thought that maybe I missed a few key parts because I had no idea what the movie was all about. Came to see what others thought and I see that I didn't miss anything because others were just as confused as I was. This movie feels like they forgot to shoot some scenes that told more of the story. Maybe there's more answers in the book This was based off of.
tt7456312,"I just have no idea what the story is about. I don't even understand what the leading characters are doing, or indeed who they really are! The events are confusing, and the characters are poorly developed."
tt7456312,Just could not make any sense of it. One of the worst films that I've ever seen.
tt7456312,"Just don't do it. Don't convince yourself to watch it because you think ""it can't be that bad....""IT REALLY IS"
tt7456312,"I've never written a review before and wanted to up the rating on this one as I read the other reviews. I totally understand why people find this movie incomprehensible, I think the producers/director assumed people would know about the Iran/Contra days of the 80s, when US Government sold weapons to Iran to fund large scale killings and related militia activities in Central America. This became a sprawling and almost incomprehensible web of crap that consumed America in the 80s. Read about the rape/murder of the Maryknoll nuns, CIA cocaine smuggling to LA, Freeway Ricky Ross (no, not the rapper, but the guy the rapper took the name from and got sued by), the Kerry Commission (yes, Senator / Prez / Married Well John Kerry), Ollie North, Charles Schultz (now of Theranos fame!), and a whole bunch more crazy stuff. Much the current poverty and migration from Central America today is partially rooted in this story, and the many crazy and horrible stories that came before in this region. So, apparently this movie assumes you'll know the story / follow the plot, and if you do it's not a bad flick."
tt7456312,"I always check the rates on IMDB before watching a movie in streaming. However this time I followed my wife's decision because she said it was ""my kind of movie"": political drama/thriller. Big mistake. Terrible script, robotic performances from Hathaway and Afleck. Willem Dafoe was a wasted talent on this one.
Do not bother."
tt7456312,"Just tonight I watched ""The Last Thing He Wanted"" with my family -- two younger siblings (16 and 18) and my mom (60). All four of us loved it. We were all talking happily about it after it was done. I had heard vaguely that it was getting bad reviews, but I hadn't actually read any. Now I'm on IMDb and I'm seeing all these one star reviews. I decided to make an account just to give my own opinion.This movie is hard to follow. That's something everyone here is mentioning. But it seems to me like it wasn't THAT hard to follow. It's only about as convoluted as ""The Big Sleep"" or ""Funeral in Berlin,"" which don't have rock bottom ratings.That makes me think that this film just hasn't found its audience. I think a lot of people came here looking for action scenes, and got bored with this mainly dialogue driven movie (which was adapted from a novel). I found the movie very tense and thrilling throughout, so that the action scenes came as exciting escalations of the ever-present tension. But if the dialogue is not hooking you, you probably won't be feeling the tension much in the first place.And the dialogue is a big thing. I have no doubt I wouldn't have been able to make sense of the movies without having the subtitles on. The characters talk fast and reference a lot of names (of places, people, and organizations). It expects you to keep up with this rapid fire pace. To be fair, this is just one of the pitfalls of adapting a novel. There are so many words, and if the actors spoke more slowly they'd never be able to fit the whole story in one movie.I think the pacing was truly admirable. Most novel adaptations either have dumb time-skips where you miss important information, or have summary-style scenes where all the interesting dialogue is cut out to leave the plot-relevant information, or have scenes that plod on much longer than they should. ""The Last Thing He Wanted"" goes at a clip, really rushing from thing to thing. But each point is actually made very well in each scene, and the rush of it becomes pretty exciting. You have no time to stop and think while your life is at risk, and you have no idea who to trust. This ends up demanding a lot of focus from the viewer. I think my family enjoyed it so much because we saw it as kind of a game. We pointed things out to each other and tried to make connections between things.I can understand reviewers who were unpleasantly surprised to find that there isn't much action here, and that the fast-paced dialogue requires a lot of concentration. That isn't everyone's cup of tea. But I also get the sneaking suspicion that people are just frustrated that this movie doesn't spell everything out about the historical background. It frustrates me because the historical background is one of the most urgent things about the movie.Some movies will start with the ABCs because they know their audience doesn't know much about the subject matter. For instance, movies like ""Hotel Rwanda"" are like an introduction to their subject matter. It doesn't assume that you know very much about the Rwandan genocide. It wants to tell you about it.But if you're always starting from basics, you never get anywhere. Sometimes there are important things to say AFTER you've learned all the basics. That's the kind of movie ""The Last Thing He Wanted"" is. It expects you to have some familiarity with the political background.And believe me, you should WANT to know more about the political background. Because this stuff is the background of our own lives today. This movie is basically about how America behaves as a superpower -- how it acts at home and how it treats other countries around the world. The way it acts today is not much different. If you try to learn a bit about the background and then keep that in mind while you watch this movies, YOU WILL LEARN SO MUCH THAT IS SO IMPORTANT! Of course, I can't guarantee that you'll like it. But this information is valuable in its own right.Basically, the backdrop for this movie is the Reagan administration's involvement in Central America and the Caribbean. The Cold War was still on, and a group of left-wing Sandinistas came to power in Nicaragua. Reagan opposed this government and backed anti-Sandinista ""Contras"". He supplied these Contras with arms and funding, and also spoke out publicly in their favour. The problem is that the Contras, to quote Wikipedia, ""engaged in a systematic campaign of terror"" -- these were not just freedom-loving citizens who opposed leftism, but brutal armies. At the same time, the US government was getting involved in similar ways in El Salvador, Grenada (a Caribbean island), and many other places across the world.Besides the moral problems associated with backing the Contras, there were also the nefarious ways that the government did it. It was not by any means a straight-forward affair -- the CIA and other government agencies acted in almost total secrecy, and a lot of shady dealing got mixed in with the declared actions the Reagan administration was taking.This is the central dynamic of ""The Last Thing He Wanted."" The shady backroom stuff can't be disentangled from what the government is officially doing. Anne Hathaway's character, Elena, is a journalist who documents the things that the government wants kept secret. Early on in the movie, Ben Affleck's character debates with another Washington guy about whether or not to ""allow"" her to keep doing her journalism there. The other guy thinks it will help to make things seem more unstable in Nicaragua, and thus give legitimacy to American operations there. Affleck's character, Treat, thinks it's too risky to have the truth come out.The question hanging over the whole film is, who is out to get who? When Elena (Hathaway) starts to get involved in her father's smuggling operation, she doesn't know who is connected to the Sandinistas, who is connected to the Contras, who is perhaps only trying to make money off of drugs, and who is connected to the US government. For people connected to the US government, we have to wonder, do they know Elena is a journalist and care about that, or is she only relevant because of the smuggling thing?Basically, everyone's motives are completely tied up with the political situation at the time. But, let's be real, the world hasn't changed that much. It's exactly the kind of high-handed treatment of other countries which are, in theory anyway, sovereign, which makes China, Russia, and other countries so recalcitrant about accepting US leadership. If this is how the US treats Nicaragua, why wouldn't they treat China the same way?It's also the same attitude which led to the (second) Iraq war. Now, I need hardly remind you that the Iraq war is a huge reason why people are so jaded about politics today. People were lied to on a massive scale, and bought into a costly and painful war over what turns out to have been nothing important. It has given both Republicans and Democrats a sense of powerlessness and cynicism (one of the things which helped elect Trump). Moreover, American prestige has never recovered, and the international well of goodwill for America has become very shallow.Well, that's my little history lesson (and I don't claim to be an expert on any of this stuff). But it gets to the heart of what matters today. The world still works the way it does in ""The Last Thing He Wanted,"" and unlike a movie, you can't just give it one star and tune it out."
tt7456312,"I think some of the poorly rated reviews are a little unfair, but the ending answers a lot of questions about the plot, so stick with it.However, the main question that I had - not satisfactorily answered - is why she went on this journey at all?"
tt7456312,"My god was this horrible. The plot never materialized and, while the cast of all stars was great to see, it lack direction. Something I never thought I would see with the talent and director.Most movies have some underlying moral or idea that they are trying to get across but even that was missing (which is something I rather like but in this instance I thought that maybe it would be what made the whole thing come together.)Bottom line, just don't waste your time. If you do you only have yourself to blame... You've been warned"
tt7456312,"The cast was promising. The first 5 minutes of tension as well. Then...what the hell? What was this movie all about? I love Anne Hateway but this was a bad decision from her to accept this role. Maybe she didn't read the script before she has signed the contract or the money was too big to say no, who knows. I wonder why almost all movies made in the last couple of years are crap boring low quality material? If i go back and see a list of films in any year of the 80's i can count more excelent movies in a single year then in the last 15 years together. Hollywood writers are more stupid now or they want us to be this low?
Netflix. Your name is equal now to very low rated boring movies."
tt7456312,"What did I watch? Couldn't catch the story.. I really tried!
Caos movie and the ending...what was that?"
tt7456312,"These days I get more and more the impression that the producers don't read scripts anymore - who the hell gave this script a green light? And why!? The story is not very interesting and the execution just adds up to an impression of a redundant and boring movie. Also what's up with those fine actors!? How William Defoe could get involved in this movie!? If he didn't read the script he should fire his agent. Anyway, to be more precise, i renamed the title of the movie to The Last Thing I Wanted, and put it on my personal blacklist that's called ""never watch or touch it again"". But for certain from a certain perspective it is an achievement to make such a bad movie with that kind of skilled cast... Verdict: one of those fast produced movies that are made these days to fill the airtime of some paychannel. My guess: The Last Thing He Wanted will be faster forgotten than produced."
tt7456312,"Now we both know the same amount of information about this movie and I watched it.
Saying it's hard to follow is like explaining duck nuts. I can picture them in my mind but it isn't until I see them in real life that I don't comprehend."
tt7456312,"This film is a moody throwback to 70s and 80s political thrillers and it's set in the Nicaraguan controversies and such, mostly stuff of the Reagan era. At the same time, it's a character-driven picture and a tropical romance set in the world of international intrigue. So, yeah, there are a lot of moving parts, and Dee Rees takes the Michael Mann route of making the audience pay close attention to how the story unfolds without making it easy in the storytelling department. Anyhow, I managed to follow the plot and if you feel it's convoluted or silly you should consult Didion novel. Also it's an unofficial remake of Antonioni's PASSENGER with Anne Hathaway taking over the Jack Nicholson part. For me, it made sense for what it is - a backbone for a sweaty and highly stylized excercise in arty thrillers like they used to make them in the seventies.Anne Hathaway is mesmerising in the leading role. Ben Affleck is good as the White House sleazebag involved with her. Toby Jones is a delight as an old semi-retired pimp who still knows how to create an intrigue. And above all else Bobby Bukowski does an impressive job as the director of photography. This film should be seen for his contribution alone.Admittedly, it's an acquired taste but not the kind of film that should be hated with such passion. Check it out on Netflix and later on you can make a nice conversation by comparing it to Mark Neveldine's Panama which basically deals with same stuff but in a completely different production milieu and ambitions."
tt7456312,"Let's just say You'd think you'd left the room and missed 30mns of the movie after watching it.. A lot of missing piece and lack of clarity/ explanation.. ultimately you're going to ask yourself wtf did I just watch? Unless you know the story/ read the book already, dont bother watching this!!"
tt7456312,"Having read the bad reviews I nearly stopped this at the 20minute mark. I kept watching and really enjoyed it, with all the twists and turns. I get what some are saying about how it jumps but I think that is to reflect Elena'a hectic life before she finds her father is ill and she then takes over his one last job. Not sure if I liked it more because of the bad reviews and I had low expectations. I did find myself replaying in my mind the story, which for me is always a good sign."
tt7456312,"Okay, I get it, most of you don't like this movie. That's fine for sure. But 'movielovers' who gave only one star to this flick and cry their eyes out because they can't understand the storyline, should find another hobby. The story is intriguing, the acting is great, as is the cinematography. Why so much hate?"
tt7456312,"I'm usually the guy that understands the movie on the fly and gets asked about it by the other. This movie made me feel stupid. I had to google an explanation of the movie, and still makes no sense to me."
tt7456312,"What a mess! Waste of time, no continuity, script-wise, jumped all over the place. I said WTF is going on with this film? Skip it, IMO."
tt8821182,"Me and the Philippines just don't seem to be on the same page, this is only the third Filipino movie I've seen and despite it only getting a 3/10 it's still the best of the bunch!It tells the story of a small island community, they're reeling from a ship wreck that is still visible from their shores. They're living in poverty due to the side effects of the disaster but some people are determined to see about locating the dead so they can be laid to rest. But yes this is a horror so ghostly things are afoot.I liked the premise, it's a pretty movie with interesting characters and I was curious which direction they were going to go with it. Alas it became apparent around the half way mark that the direction wasn't a good one and certainly not an original one.The movie is dark, bleak but looks great for a movie from the Philippines. Sadly however it's one of those silly supernatural movies that makes the rules up as it goes along and ultimately doesn't make a vast amount of sense.I get what they were going for, I just think they failed miserably.Regardless this is still the best movie I've seen the country put out.The Good:Some great visualsInteresting conceptsThe Bad:Falls apart badlyCertain aspects make little to no sense"
tt8821182,"Aurora definitely is a big budget film. But it failed big time. In the fb posts that i have read, it says critics do not like the film Aurora. But i would like to correct that critics and the ordinary audience share the same sentiments, reactions and comments, the pacing utterly moves like a turtle, the story development is stalled by the unknown and the script is flawed. All of these things have contributed in the poor storytelling of the director.Would you take a job of finding dead bodies for 50,000 pesos? At an instant, yes! Especially for Leana who only expressed her problems with money only once in the film. There was no pattern to really establish money concerns or any threat that they are facing (with her sister Rita). More so, it is unthinkable for anyone to be a scavenger of decomposing corpses, who does not have the tools and gears to do it. So, Leana ended up asking for help from Eddie (Allan Paule), a fisherman who is more convincing to be poor and needs money. The more logical people to do the rescue (or scavenging) are the Coast Guards, who have the gear and tools, which by the way were accused of being the accomplice in the overloaded Aurora ship. That only shows Coast Guards have more reasons to to clean up their mess before anyone finds it.The funny part was when Eddie and Ricky found a corpse and was placed in a boat hut. All three of them (Leana, Eddie and Ricky) gathered around decomposing body who seem to be experts like Coroners and were not moved by the stink, gross appearance. And the succeeding sequence shows them vomiting and seemingly took them a while to react to the corpse.In the many PR articles, it says Aurora is not the typical jump scare film. It is pegged as a Hollywood horror film like 'The Others', which was directed well and leaves no confusion. And the big difference is Aurora was not creepy or will not even give you the feeling of paranoia. But I would like to credit the music score, which in itself is excellent. However, I get the the impression that the music was very exhausted in trying to help the film develop and build up.Among other confusing points was the intercutting sequences between their house and the Aurora ship that shows the people in the ships's engine room. Was it the imagination of Leana? Was it a storm surge? How did they get into the ship?
Or was it a Hollywood signature that give the audience confusion?Definitely, Aurora is not a horror film.I gave 3 stars because there are only 3 elements that are good in the film Aurora; Actors, Cinematography and Production design."
tt8821182,"This was the most drawn out life wasting experience of my life. What's also sad is, this could've been a tone better. I should've known from the beginning credits that something was WAY OFF. You'll know what I mean 😂"
tt8821182,"Napaka pangit na pelikula.
Gin de Mesa please po wag na kayong gumawa ng pelikula. Please please please po.
Zero 🌟"
tt8821182,"Kudos to the cinematography, but the plot, characters, theme and type of conflict are frustrating. The movie lacked a unique story line that did not take advantage of the setting."
tt8821182,"I didn't really enjoy the movie, but in case the people that worked in it are reading these, I'm going to write first about the one thing I really enjoyed about the movie:
It managed to scare and make me feel uneasy WITHOUT JUMPSCARES. This is a massive accomplishment, given that nowadays most horror movies relly on them.This movie is sad but not in a ""dramatic movie"" way. It's sad because it could have been an awesome horror movie but they, somehow, managed to do everything wrong.The first hour of the movie is full of drama and sadness, a ship crashes near a small town and suddenly everyone is leaving. The reason is the ship that crashed, but there's not much explaining of that, so I don't know if it was because they thought it was haunted or because the town's economy relied on tourists that would not come because of a shrunken ship. I don't know, and there was plenty of time to explain it, yet they didn't.Then there's the two sisters' story... At the very beginning I thought they were mother and daughter but then it turns out they're not. Their family story is told in a really brief, out of context flashback, which leaves you confused for a few seconds until you kind of understand what's going on. Yet again, that part of the story was interesting and I would have loved for them to show us more of that, because it gives you the reasons for most of the things the main character, Leanna, does.There's many other stuff that I think was easy to correct but they somehow missed it, characters that seem to appear and disappear out of nowhere without really adding to the plot, or they add so little that they were just a misuse of budget.Then, the ending is just so poor and it could have been such a masterpiece. This makes me so sad. It's weird, they tie real life stuff that could be real and awesome with a weird ghost story, extremely poor and undeveloped, the ending is just weird.The worst thing about the movie was that I spent one hour and 20 minutes waiting for something to happen. It's awful, it's boring. Really if you consider watching this movie, just watch the introduction and then fast forward it to the end, most of the movie is a waste of time."
tt8821182,"I refuse to watch this again. I watched this a couple of moths ago and i'm still mad over the fact that two hours of my life were thrown on the garbage because of this giant piece of s... Forget all the other movies I rated 1/10, most of them are masterpieces compared to this. Aurora is easily the worst film of 2018. Why? I don't have words (except insults) to describe how poorly made this film is. Let's do quick math here...what's the result of garbage acting + a script only a monkey could've written + the effects of the Spawn movie? Well, the sum is a 0/10. Seriously, this is one of the worst movies of all time."
tt8821182,"I liked it. I thought the main actress was great and she made me care what happened to her and her little sister.
The movie seemed very old fashioned to me, like something I would have watched back in the 70's. Maybe it was the music. They kept playing scary music before anything scary was happening, like they used to do to foreshadow scary events coming up back in the day. The music itself was OK but it didn't seem to fit a lot of the early scenes, in my opinion.
I did enjoy it though. I like a good old fashioned ghost story."
tt8821182,"Your acting is weak and you eat up the entire film budget as evidenced by this film and also buybust. There is NO supporting cast to the weak ""lead actress"" in both films and she definitely cannot carry a movie. Just stick to modeling thanks!"
tt8821182,"Aurora: A Philippines horror film involving a ship wreck and ghosts wanting to go home. A coastal village has been visited by death in the form of a shipwreck, the remains of the ship are visible on rocks close to shore. Relatives seek the remains of their loved ones but many bodies are still missing, perhaps trapped in the wreck. The event has cast a dark cloud over the village, fishermen can no longer sell their catch, peope move to the city. Leanna (Anne Curtis) runs an inn, when the relatives of the victims leave she is without customers and links up with fishermen to collect rewards for recovering the missing bodies. But she and her young sister Rita (Phoebe Villamor) catch glimpses of strange characters, hear voices and even seem to make contact with spirits of the missing.A slow moving film which might have benefited from a 15 minute cut in it's running time. However it was massive success in the Philippines, made for P$3 million, it took in P$100 million at the box-office. The ghosts are well imagined and appear to be seeking closure just as much as their relatives are. While not malevolent they will seize on to divers who approach the wreck. Ghosts appear in windows and flashbacks of the grounding of the ship are related through stories and visions. A cover-up may have taken place and the real cause of the shipwreck turns out to be even more frightening than any conspiracy could hope to conceal. Director/co-writer Yam Laranas delivers an engaging Ghost Story. 7/10. On Netflix."
tt8821182,"The main character should always be the key to solve a mystery. not just a tool of the solution. this movie is like the story solved itself. the character just went to a horror train and after seeing all the ghost, then the story ends.poor CGI.i watched it till the end. i didn't enjoy"
tt8821182,"Watched this with my family because I don't want them watching Vice ganda film during MMFF season. I wanna commend the cinematography and the moody tone of the movie but the story line, a big waste of our family's experience. It's in the same ""such a waste of money"" level with Kuwaresma (starring Sharon Cuneta).If they want us to support Filipino movie, they should have at least produce quality films."
tt8821182,Most of my one star reviews are the movies so bad I can't finish sitting through them. This is one of them. It's so slow paced and boring I just couldn't sit through any more of it.
tt8821182,Horrible script. Horrible acting. Horrible effects. Horrible storyline.
tt8821182,This movie will literally waste your time I didn't finish it since the story and the movie effects is not really appealing and interesting.The Ship is a big joke all their effects from graphics to sounds is so uglyyyyyyy!!!!! 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
tt8821182,"This film could have been so promising as it had a really good storyline, great acting and casting as well as cinematography but by the time they used the special effects in showing the big giant ghost, it just went all downhill! I guess the ship was already sinking even before the journey began."
tt8821182,"I stumbled across this by chance when I was browsing Netflix. Catching up on some Western horror films I'd missed that were recommended to me, Aurora popped up as a suggestion for me. I originally skipped past it before realising it was Filipino and I went back to it to watch the trailer. I've been looking to have my first films and dramas in each country on MDL so I decided to go ahead with Aurora being my fist Filo film after clarifying it was Filipino.My Twitter friends said that it was hyped up in the Philippines but it was commonly held as a bit of a flop within the horror genre.Now, Aurora is made and is meant to be a horror film. I went into it expecting to be a little spooked, not to a high degree because of the reviews I had heard said it was pretty bad. The few CGI effects to give this the horror theme completely tanked for me, and I won't lie - the horror is pretty bad. It doesn't hold its own as a horror film in any form.However, the acting in this, the story behind it are intriguing. It kept me hooked in, it kept me rooted in my seat in pure curiosity. This is definitely a much more sad thriller than a horror film. I finished this feeling devastated, with tears in my eyes after the credits began to roll. The acting in this made this utterly amazing, the cast truly brought the feelings in this to life. It felt like this was currently happening in Asia, watching these families go through their loss and watching Leanna and her younger sister was going through hell.
The music in this was as well amazing, it fits the film perfectly; there wasn't a single score in this that didn't help my emotions lift or drop alongside the story.I think the best way to go into this film is to not expect a good horror film. Expect a sad, chilling thriller that is similar to many real-life occurrences around the world. Not as good as it could have been as a horror film, but definitely give this a try if you like sad films."
tt8821182,"The cinematography is beautiful and sets the mood and tone for the film. The story in itself is intriguing. It reminded me of the setting of the movie, Cold Skin. Everything else is inconsistent. the CGI goes from incredibly amateurish to good. Some of the ""ghost"" scenes would have come across much better and a bit more frightening with makeup alone. The acting vacillates between good and again, amateurish. I wont say skip it, because it is beautiful to look at. I just cant give this a higher rating. Its really a 3.5 film."
tt8821182,They could've done better with the plot and musical scoring.
tt9749604,"Currently available on Netflix. I had to watch the movie over 4 or 5 days because I couldn't take more than 20 minutes of it in one sitting. Incredibly lame writing. No laughs at all. Awful, awful awful movie. Do. Not. Waste. Your. Time."
tt9749604,"Horrible acting. No story line. Whenever you watch movie, you want something that stays with you. This was a total waste of time."
tt9749604,Far away worst Turkish movie ever. Scenerio is awful. Act are awful. Waste of time and money. Most nonsense final in movie history.
tt9749604,"OMG, en kötü filmi degiiiil!Definitely a typical ""trying to save the relationship"" kind of rom-com but with the Turkish twists of pretty seaside cinematography and an opening scene of Iskender kebab that starts off the story.Biggest disappointment would be some green screen moments amongst the stunning shots of Fethiye, but they don't ruin it all that much. Plenty of scenes will have your jaw dropping, your eyes opened, and wanting to paraglide above the Aegean Sea or cruise through those mountain roads at some point in your life with a sexy Turkish lover.Apart from the setting, Murat delivers more physical comedy and facial expressions in this one, but the supporting characters made this movie a lot better! Gonca's rambling, quirky lines and inventive devising of Okan's demise were sometimes too much to keep up with in the subtitles but she had me laughing the most. She only got better with Bülent's ax-wielding antics towards the end. A little over the top and sadistic, but it was some of the best comical violence I've seen so far in a Turkish comedy.It's just a bright, silly comedy that utilizes good music in the right spots, a few laughs and showcases one of the bluest, prettiest spots of the Turkish Riviera that a non-Turkish audience should absolutely appreciate."
tt9749604,"My favorite actors are typically those that have hilariously exaggerated facial expressions when performing and this movie had it all! I really enjoyed the dynamics in character performance. I did not see the ending coming at all.I will admit I was afraid to watch the move at first given the title ""Kill Me If You Dare"" as I wasn't in the mood for anything full on horror, but this was a majority rom-com which is probably why I enjoyed it so much.I did decide to watch the film after making the shocking discovery that the two main actors in this film also had major roles in a TV show I recently watched on Netflix called ""Another Self."" That tv show was amazing as it interwoven ancestry family constellations into its main theme and I will forever recommend it to anyone I meet.I'm really happy that Another Self tv show led me to Kill Me If You Dare. I laughed throughout the film during a time when I really needed it."
tt10230404,"I was quietly confident about this film being good as I have found, being a horror fanatic, some of the best ones I have watched have been low-budget, foreign horror films. Without the overinflated budget which means that the films are full of cheap scares and CGI, smaller budget films rely more on creating good atmosphere and good acting so I was quietly confident.The film is actually 4 separate ""ghost"" stories in an anthology so the best way to review them is to do so individually...1. So this one didn't really feel like a horror film to me. The beginning of the film had remanence of the start of ""the grudge"" with a carer looking after an elderly person in a home that seems haunted. Most horror films will gradually grow until they reach a crescendo or they have peaks and troughs but this film lacked both. It stayed lukewarm throughout and I found myself losing interest... So much so that I actually missed the twist right at the end and it wasn't until I read the reviews I realise I had missed something. I think it was a good premise but ultimately it just lacked a good storyline and presentation.2. This segment was filmed in almost completely monochromatic fashion which does lend towards the desolate, aged appearance of the film. Ultimately this one was very confusing and there was not enough backstory or background to the characters to really understand the point of the film. Towards the end it became quite surreal and it was hard to tell what was real and what wasn't but without knowing the characters backstory, I had trouble feeling sadness and sympathy for the main character and her dilemma. Even though she was played very well, this film just lacked substance.3. This was the best one of the four for me. The setting of the film was very good and I liked the base storyline. Having children involved as well, also lends towards the dire situation of the film. It still was low budget so it relied heavily on sound effects, of my camera screeches and howls and set to create the tension and it started off really well. However as it progressed once again there seems to be any lack of definition towards the ending or what indeed actually had happened and once again I was left really disappointed after previously being captivated. That being said this one definitely have the most promise.4. Although the setting of this film was not as good as the one before, I found the storyline the easiest to follow and most ""ghost story"" like. The story premise was easy to follow and understand, there was no ambiguity and what you see, was what you got. The sons obsession with his dead grandma was suitably creepy and helped build the storyline but the acting did feel a little wooden and unfortunately this is made worse by the poor quality dubbing. However I did enjoy the story and found this one had a satisfying, understandable ending.Overall I have to say that I was a little bit disappointed and I did expect more from this anthology. Quite a lot of stories just felt rushed and felt like they were filmed in a day without much thought. A lot of them are quite ambiguous endings and there was really no clarity towards what happened in a lot of them. Because 4 had squeezed into the space of a standard film, there was no time to build background or have any kind of understanding and therefore compassion for the characters you are watching and I feel in a horror film that is necessary to help you feel the tension that they feel."
tt10230404,The only scary part of Ghost Stories is how these 4 are supposed to be amongst Bollywood's top film directors. Serious rubbish and scary thought about the future of Bollywood. Dibakars segment is relatively better but Anurag Kashyap needs to retire. He is going the RGV route. Except that Anurags peak has been much lesser than RGV.
tt10230404,Horrendous! This is my first review. 4 directors take a huge dump on the horror genre. Ridiculous and laughable plot lines. Total nonsense. Karan Johar has shown that he's capable of producing the worst ever movies across genres. Film school freshmen could have done a better job than him on a similar budget.
tt10230404,"I had huge expectation but it turns out to be blunder. While watching I was hoping the next one will be a good one but all 3 were B grade horror without hot scenes. I still havent understood the first one. Anurag second and dibakar third were more like look away challange. The make up was hilarious. I got to know that Zombies have decision making abilities whom to eat. Directors There is fine line between gross and horror. Fourth one I didnt watch coz its Karan Johar making horror. I hope my review will save someone 2 and half hr time. Our generation watch movies like The Wailing, 4bia. Dont make these craps."
tt10230404,"Was expecting better!
Do not miss the one by Dibakar. It's crazy 👌🏻"
tt10230404,"Yes, only 3rd story is interesting, others are just a waste of time.
Story by Anurag kashyap was the most boring one, Karan johar's story had very stereotypical scenes and again boring story, zoya's story could not maintain the interest till end, But the exception is the Dibakar banergee's story, its interesting, gripping, good cinematography and set design, lights and camera work is really good!"
tt10230404,"Zoya's short :- well performances were good, setup was good but horror element was missing. Unfortunately this zoya's story is forgettable comparing with her lust story short. I think zoya could have done a better job.Anurag's short :- creepy as hell. I understand 25 mins of it but after that I had tons of questions and this short didn't gave me anything. I think anurag is only best at showing human horror like he did in ugly. this is anurags worst. forgettable movie.Dibakar's short :- The best amongst all. Dibakars truly understands the horror. It was intriguing, funny and thrilling, I wish it was longer and I don't know since inception everyone wants to leave their ending incomplete. I love this short wish I could see this in a movie with runtime of 2 hours atleast.Karan's short :- Predictable story. Performances were good, setup was nicely done but I think karan is still an immature director. There were many bollywood cliches and ending was illogial"
tt10230404,"Terrible is an understatement. Very disturbing, illogical & pathetic stories. Except the one directed by Zoya Akhtar, the rest are extremely ameuterish . Wonder what Netflix was thinking when they allowed this kind of content to go on air!"
tt10230404,"Four stories, all about ghosts in one way or another. In the third one the concept is subtle and it seems to entail a social critique, which I liked. The first one could have been even better with a somewhat different twist (e.g. the old lady being a future self of the nurse would have been cool). The second one gave my gf nightmares and I found it the most disturbing one, partly because of the imagery. The fourth one was a slow burn and the ending was ok for this type of tale."
tt10230404,"As the title suggests, this is a combination of four different stories told by four different directors! And The most important thing is they haven't indulge in the proper Horror Genre before. Although Anurag & Dibakar had some stints in relation to horror elements but it was never really wholesome! Zoya Akhtar and Karan Johar; for them it's a brand new territory that they failed horribly on. I think I should give reviews individually to each story here. That would make sense more!
Let's start.Zoya Akhtar : Anthology starts with Zoya's Story. It's a simple generic storyline that never impresses. It's not written properly and the execution falls short. The performances were just Okayish. The setups and The ambient feel was there and I really felt pity for Zoya as she should have used the ambient elements more to develop the story gradually. The sound score too was fitting well enough and A little bit polishing could have made this story better for sure! Not Too bad for a Debutant in Horror Genre. 5/10Anurag Kashyap : Man oh Man! I just loved his story. The favourite from the lot. Many people are getting it wrong because they haven't seen such dark disturbing horror before. Although it's a norm in Hollywood films; especially the indie ones. I'm so glad Anurag decided to introduce the same formula here. Sobhita Dhulipala as the lead just nailed her performance! The little kid was intriguing too. As a whole it's a psychological take on Horror.
It wants you to tell much deeper things than the surface! That; I absolutely loved! 10/10Dibakar Banerjee : My second favorite from this Anthology! He chose a proper take on horror genre! Combination of some Zombie Slashers and Gore Violence! Dibakar Banerjee shined through his execution on the tale! Performances were noteworthy. As well as the environment suited perfectly for the concept. There is a scene in the classroom that should be the highlight of this story! You will know when you watch it. But my only complaint would be the Socio Political take at the end. It wasn't that necessary in my opinion. 9/10Karan Johar : I never thought I would see a Horror Film by Karan Johar ever. And after watching his Debut effort; I really hope he won't choose to do so next time! In this story there wasn't really any horror. Or even jumpscares. The art direction was good. Visuallly it was eye catching as it has always been with Karan Johar's films. His trademark take on film making has been presented here. But other than that there's nothing to see. The performances though convincing enough for the Story but never matched my expectations. Worst from the lot. 4/10As a whole; I must say without Anurag and Dibakar's Contribution, This would have been a garbage in the name of Horror. But thanks to both of them for saving the sinking ship."
tt10230404,I have watched lots of series and movies in Netflix. I guess this is the worst among all. Not even a single story is interesting. So dull and bore.
tt10230404,"There are 4 stories. The first with Jahnavi is okay, rest is all waste of time."
tt10230404,"Let's go one by one:Zoya Akhtar:
Okay, it was quite a watchable chapter, and to me doubtlessly the main reason to watch is the stupendous performance of Surekha Sikri, who gives it the tension and mystery it needs. Jahnvi Kapoor is quite effective, too. Her presence here made me wonder how this role would have been played by her late mother Sridevi, who fitted such genres perfectly. The conclusion is not very surprising, but it's quite a nice chapter.Anurag Kashyap:
This one for some reason reminded me of Kashyap's film No Smoking, and it was one hell of a mess. Actually the chapter was more amusing than chilling, and it was not very good for someone as good as Kashyap.Dibakar Banerjee:
Indeed, this one is perhaps the most effective of the four segments. The entire zombie track was derivative obviously but it had a very nice political message which worked out well. Some of the portions were indeed disgusting, but the climactic portions of this chapters were perhaps the most interesting in the entire film.Karan Johar:
As one can expect from Johar, this one is set in a luxurious mansion, and in this regard the visuals make it more than it would have been otherwise. The setting is stunning, but the story is nothing to write home about. It actually gave me some 'Get Out' vibes (that great 2017 film), but obviously much less efficient. Again, much of it is almost comical in tone, and the conclusion is most predictable, making for a rather forgettable chapter overall.---
In many ways, Ghost Stories is exactly what happens when filmmakers fall in love with ideas than substance. A few good moments here and there do not really save this forgettable anthology film."
tt10230404,"Cliche !! only thing that came into my mind while watching this Horror Anthology. Indian literature is enriched with bone chilling horror stories yet filmmakers relies on western crap. And watching Karan Johar trying his hands on horror is just pathetic. Anurag Kashyap's Story was dull and boring so is Zoya Akhtar's. Only saving point of this Anthology is Dibakar's take on Warewolves who actually looked more like Big Foot, was interesting and had bit of gore which is new for Indian movies. Avoiding this one won't be a loss. Rather watch Ghost Stories 2017, which is actually a good Brit Anthology horror."
tt10230404,"If this is the cream of bollywood, then we should be worried."
tt10230404,"Very disappointing esp given the directors. The stories are uninteresting. The first one by Zoya Akhtar lacked a plot; the 2nd one by Anurag Kashyap was so unreal, the 3rd one had some silly man eaters and I have no appetite to get to the last one."
tt10230404,"This is going to be an unpopular opinion amongst my fellow countrymen and women, but this is an excellent set of short stories. I've a theory that over the last couple of years, Indian cinema particularly Bollywood and Tollywood is undergoing an unfortunate string of bad movies and has skewed the expectations of the audience. I'm confident that in the coming years, this is going to change, and these short stories are the step in the right direction.Another theory of mine is that this film will help the audience move away from the idea that horror movies need to ""scary"" to be called one. Midsomer, Vitch, Dr. Sleep, and even Stanley's The Shining are some of the films that don't use jump scares, but IMHO, some of the best Horror films that started a new genre of movies. I'm not comparing these short stories to the above masterpieces, but merely pointing out horror movies doesn't have to be scary to be successful.With all of that said, these short stories are great. If you are watching these expecting jump-scares, stay away -- this movie is not for you. If you on the other-hand like slow churn horror movies and shows, which are open to interpretation, and *very* unsettling scenes, the short stories are great!The first short story is good, straight-forward and NOT open to interpretation. The ending is good, tho. Cinematography and the atmosphere are not very well built. But I think the climax makes it a worth one time watch. (3/5)The third story is best of all. Fantastic cinematography, great atmosphere, and very unsettling -- also open to interpretation. (4/5)The fourth story is OK -- there is nothing that stands out not that it's as bad as the rating makes it to be. The interpretation felt more like a statement on society than anything else. (2.5/5)The only problem I've is with the second story. Colors are great, Anurag decided to shot it in greys, making it look like a noir, which is a strange choice since it's anything but. Anurag does a great job of making the story very claustrophobic and the use of colors makes it more intense, but I hated the excessive use of gore when it wasn't necessary. Without the gore scene, especially the goriest one, I'd still think the story wouldn't have lost any of its meaning or the feel it was trying to elicit. (3/5)That makes my rating a 6.25/10."
tt10230404,Staring at the floor for two and half hours would have been a better decision.
tt10230404,"I would give all four the benefit of doubt here. This is a genre that none of them have attempted before, although it is easy to identify which of them might have directed a particular segment.Dibakar's and Anurag's shirts were my picks, mainly because theres's more to their stories than what seems to be happening at the surface level. Dibakar's segment is a strong political commentary that disguises itself at horror. It's hard to look away.Anurag's story is Kafkasque in its narration with strong and clever writing. While it may not appeal to everyone, this is the filmmaker at his most experimenting and audacious best. The visuals are powerful and technically the film is spot-on.Zoya goes predictable in her conclusion, but her film is helmed with strong performances by the two actresses. Sukrekha Sikri's act is alone worth watching this one, but it's Jahnvi also who throws a surprise.The least impressive story was Johar's, even though it was finely paced and had a gorgeous Mrunal Thakur and a charming Avinash Tiwary. It uses all cliched horror tropes, and the final result is a tad underwhelming.I would still this a 9/10 with the overall idea and execution, and the initiative of the four filmmakers in coming up with something different all the time deserves solid applause."
tt10230404,"First of all, I appreciate the bold and experimental look of the movie. I always look forward to a good anthology film. Now there are 4 stories in it, let's look at each Director's work -Zoya Akhtar - 7/10 - Tried to capture an eery feeling but couldn't because of the actors and pacing.Anurag Kashyap - 9/10 - Wow, This is Kashyap's version of 'The Witch'. Bold and experimental. Didn't hold back to tell an abstract film with a creepy subtext and strange direction choices in a good way.Dibakar Banerjee - 8.5/10 - Most experimental story of all. The metaphorical comparison of urban-rural connection was handled well. I also liked the political statement presented by the director.Hmm, Good and great stories by far so why the low rating. That's because -
Karan Johar - 5/10 - Just leave it, man. This is not your genre. Such a cheap attempt to approach the story like those short horror stories I used to watch on television when I was a kid."
tt10230404,"A ghost story is supposed to be scary, it's supposed to be something that gives you goosebumps, something that you close your eyes to and still watch with a corner of your eye.
Story 1: Zoya Akhtar: It starts slow, builds a moment to give you a shiver in the spine but as soon as you are just about to get scared it ends the story.
Story 2: Anurag Kashyap: It was a physco story seemed something with a hidden meaning of sorts made me feel vomitty rather than having goosebumps.
Story 3: I got so bored didn't feel like watching it.
Absolute waste"
tt10230404,"Stories are complicated enough, thrills are too few. Dibakar and Zoya gave it a good shot but Karan and Anurag showed that horror is not their cup of tea.Many questions unanswered, character motives absent, audiences made to assume background and context. This is how these directors are trying to eye a prestigious international award.Dibakar Banerjee segment lacked background explanation properly.
Zoya's story was more tragic than thrilling
Anurag's segment was for the hyper intellects
Karan Johar's movie was a joke at best.I would suggest these guys to watch:
The conjuring (clap scene)
Thummbad
Paranormal activity (leg pulling scene)Enough talk. Watch only if you have abundant time in life to waste...."
tt10230404,"As usual, indian industry is selling all its cr*P to Netflix or may be they are getting it for free because all recent releases are utter rubbish.....i will not go deep into this but just save your time and jump to third story which is a bit watchable otherwise simply pass it.........."
tt10061256,"I'm kind of at a loss of words here because my mind is still reeling from what I just experienced.... I didn't even finish the film because I got so frustrated. I read the manga years ago so I know the supposed ending but i'm not even sure if they kept it the same and quite frankly I don't care. The only reason I even gave this 4 stars and not 1 is because I laughed quite a lot, so when you look at it as a comedy it has some redeeming qualities, I guess. The acting was mediocre, the dialogue was infuriating (the amount of time the word stupid and cute were said makes them seem unreal to me now, like are those even words ; who knows) Don't even get me started on the editing I felt like I was partaking an acid trip half the time and the other half I started dozing off with the boring panorama shots. So many situations were left unanswered so if you haven't read the manga good luck with this one."
tt10061256,"I read the manga and liked it a lot, so I had high expectations, but the movie was one big disappointment... The plot is rushed and it's not explained properly, the dialogue is bad and the scenes seem disconnected, like they were just thrown together randomly.
One redeeming grace is the background music, like Pachelbel's Canon in D (one of my favourite classical pieces) and Beethoven's Fur Elise, though the latter was often remixed in modern and completely inappropriate versions.
The story had great potential, too bad they made a mess out of the movie :("
tt10061256,""" Hot Gimmick : Girl Meets Boy "" is not for everyone.When it comes to the artistic part, the movie had an interesting cinematography, but, most of the time, it gave me motion sickness, as the camera zoomed in and out, the characters kept running and changing positions too suddenly and quickly. The story was also too thinly spread and the way it was presented it made it confusing. So, it was hard to enjoy it as the whole theatrical approach distructing. The performances seemed good though.So, overall, four out of ten."
tt10061256,"There is no way that anyone, let alone young girls should be watching this and think that it's normal. Why writing something so awfully harmful and beyond all else abusive!!? This is not love. This is not romance. This is just low level behavior in people that you should not be around let alone tolerate. Would've given it minus 10 if it was possible. Big NO!"
tt10061256,If you have never read the manga you will have no clue what is going on. This has no character development or story. It is merely just a random chain of events. The only thing that makes it connect is having read the manga and knowing what happens in between these events.Not only did they botch the story and characters but the filming style was horrible too. It made me motion sick just trying to watch and what is with the random scenes of random stuff. They cut so much important things to instead have clips of a bird in the sky and some cranes and lights and staircases. Not even sure how this movie was 2 hours long.
tt10061256,This movie was a whole mess and quite frankly the editing and the storyline made it uncomfortable to watch. I almost gave up watching it halfway and honestly wish I would have.
tt10061256,Except it isn't. What a mess of a movie. I don't know the manga so I have no clue what's the story here. It goes very quickly from one scene to another and a lot of pausing is involved. At some point I just gave up and watched it like it's a music video. It became somewhat enjoyable then.
tt10061256,"Have to say, the story is really weird and a bit difficult to keep up with. I'll probably read the manga to fill in some gaps but it was alright. I do like the somewhat character development from ryoki but that was kinda it. All the male leads were toxic but he was the only option I guess. The cinematography though, wow, that really blew me away, I'd watch the film purely for that. The acting is fairly mediocre. Nothing extravagant apart from the shots taken. Director did well! Apart from that don't expect anything more."
tt10061256,"Wow. So many bad things to say that I don't know where to start. I was so excited to see this live-action movie from one of my favorite manga stories, but it was just horrible. If I hadn't read the manga, I would have been totally lost. The movie just jumps from event to event, with absolutely zero character development at all. The dialogue was really bad, and made no sense half of the time. Crucial events were left out, other events were changed so drastically that they were just limp. There was no emotional connection between any of the characters. This movie just grazes over the main events of a very large story, and it feels disjointed. You get each event, but not ""the why"" it happened or what brought them to that point. It's like someone picked out the main events from the manga, drew a timeline on a whiteboard, and said... let's go make these scenes, but they didn't add any of the details that lead up to them. So many things were left out that were crucial to the overall story. Also, the characters were nothing like what Miki Aihara created... Hatsumi Narita was a naive pushover; she wasn't stupid. Ryoki was rich, spoiled, intelligent, socially powerful... and decidedly ready to lose his virginity (the catalyst for the entire story). Their relationship was one that started with commands and orders, but slowly developed into communication, compromise, and consideration. Hatsumi learned to stand up for herself and Ryoki listened and learned from her, each developing feelings for the other along the way. That was the core of the manga: to communicate, listen, and learn with each other. None of that was in this movie. To watch this movie without reading the manga, you would think they were in a completely abusive relationship. This movie was just really bad. If you haven't read the manga, go read it to get the real story... with all the drama, emotion, and even humor that should have been in this movie."
tt10061256,"I have never liked the plot of this type of comic before, but this movie gives me an unprecedented feeling..I found that this may not be what people expected, there are many other movies based on this kind of comics.. And this movie is different from them... this is very special, surprising.. there is a special rhythm in editing. The arrangement of landscape shoots and close-ups are novel. ..The pace is not boring, the angles and tones are also interesting, it really brings out the feeling... Especially the train station scene, they measured the space of the platform, film in one take, with the interesting music, this is not an easy taskit might not be a perfect movie, but that is what makes this movie special, raw, and almost experimental. I still enjoyed it very much and feel new when I watch it for the second timeI feel quite sad when I see this movie is so underrated"
tt10061256,"As someone who loved the manga, all I want to say is; read the manga instead.
The cameracrew must have smelling their socks while filming, the cutting is horrible, and the plot is only thinly displayed, could've used more meat. The acting and lines are either horribly translated or just poorly written. If they had made it into a series, they still would have to change most of the actors for it to be decent.
BUT and it's a big but, it gets more true to the manga at the middle, and that really lifts it a bit. Not enough to be good, because there is so much missing in between the changes."
tt10061256,"I was expecting this movie for a long time, and it's not worth it. First, about the characters' appearances. It really bugs me that the hair of the characters keep the face of the actors hidden. It's really hard to see their expression with that kind of hairstyle. Besides, they do not look good in this movie as they do in real life. Make up artists should really do something about that. Second, about the way they shoot the movie. It's really confusing to me who have no idea about the manga and just saw this for the first time. It's really rush and the conversations seem disconnected. Some scenes just make me feel dizzy. I really don't like the way they shoot the movie. Also, it feels like some unprofessional people do this because the resolution of the film is very low. I thought my internet connection was bad, but it wasn't. Ok, finally, about the actors. They seem to be inexperienced and not be able to pull this character off."
tt10061256,"I understand that the film is quite a show of the complexity of the youth. But sometimes the complexity of the presentation doesn't necessarily make the story difficult to understand. And I think the movie didn't reach the peak of the story. The audience doesn't really understand the theme. The audience was unable to grasp the essence of the story. At this point I'm rating only 4, but if the synopsis of the story is better then I'll give it 5. Overall, I'm quite disappointed with the story."

tt10061256,"I dont know why people hating this movie, but personally this is one of the best Japanese movie that I ever watch. The story is somewhat complicated and weird, and may not appeal for everyone. The cinematography is SO FREAKING GOOD, combine with the editing makes the movie so great. This movie should get more positive review."
tt10061256,"I LOVE THE STORYLINE,MAYBE SOME OF THE MOST PEOPLE JUST DON'T GET IT WHAT A LONELY MEANS."
tt8304386,Good performonce of Dulquer.... But movie has a poor script....
tt8304386,"The indian cricket team is going thru a rough patch. The handsome captain regularly gets out at 99. The ex captain hates him. The players have lost their confidence. In walks a lucky lady named 'zoya' n suddenly everything is hunky dory. The team starts winning, the captain hits a century, the players r in good spirits. Sonam Kapoor is extremely artificial. Dulquer Salmaan is extremely likeable. Some scenes r downright silly. #TheZoyaFactor rating 2/5."
tt8304386,A good start .... But you can watch it once... totally an average
tt8304386,"Salman is worth better he is a mind blowing actor wonder why he chose this movie come on bro you can deliver better movies choose better script like charlie, Abcd and even karwaan was better the list goes on."
tt8304386,"#FinalVerdictWe do relish madcap entertainers but what director Abhishek Sharma serves here transcends all limits! I must avow that it's futile to expect anything sensible except for mindless mediocrity. If there's a universally reviled film this year, it's Fox Star Studios & Ad-Labs Films Limited's The Zoya Factor, more so because some of director Abhishek Sharma's earlier films were hits. No director can be senseless enough to think this is fine or remotely funny.Idiocy is a gentle term for what is unleashed upon us. It's a two hour show reel of plot-less, witless, joylessness. Silliness can be great fun. But brainless doesn't have to translate to brain-dead. The direction is a complete let-down. The situational gags try too hard to tickle the funny bones of the viewers consummately and the essence of the story gets dissipated because of unwanted scenes galore with no tie-in to the ongoing. It doesn't even get its 'Cricket' aspect right. The direction is middle-of-the-road precisely, as the writing (Anuja Chauhan, Pradhuman Singh Mall and Neha Sharma) lacks the meat and the sequence of events just don't work. The pace also mar the overall impact with songs acting as killjoy. After Studios' VFX is pathetic. The Zoya Factor will drain you at the end.While it begins on a promising note - it's a premise ripe with comic potential - the graph only spirals southwards barely half an hour into the film. It's not sacrilege to attempt a no-brainer but the smiles/guffaw/laughter should never be in short supply. The actors, putting their best foot forward, try so so so hard to make you giggle even when the gags are weak. The banal jokes and the lame PJs coupled with the muddled screenplay are clearly responsible for the royal mess.Because there's little to count on in terms of story, the fate of The Zoya Factor depends almost entirely on the likeability of its leads. The film belongs to Dulquer Salmaan , who proves, yet again, that he is an incredible actor. He adds so much to the sequences. Sonam Kapoor delivers an earnest performance but she fails to rise above the flawed script. Angad Bedi does complete justice to his character. Sikandar Kher seems comfortable in the given space. Sanjay Kapoor is natural. Anil Kapoor's cameo is hilarious. Manu Rishi Chadha is fine, not overdoing the lisping bit. Koel Purie is strictly okay. Pooja Bhamrrah (Sonali) looks quite glamorous and plays the supporting part well. From the Cricketers, the ones who leave the mark are Abhilash Chaudhary (Shivi), Gandharv Dewan (Harry) and Sachin Deshpande (Lakhi).To sum up, The Zoya Factor is not entirely unwatchable because it's shot in a manner that's easy on the eye. But walking out of the cinema once the lights come back on, you're just glad it's finally over. Stay miles away from it! A nickel-and-dime stuff!"
tt8304386,"The first thing that anyone who has seen Dulquer's mesmerizing performances in movies like Charlie,NPCB will definitely wonder why he did choose this movie after all.A really bad plot and it was 2 hours of torture.Watch this movie only when you have literally no other movie to watch."
tt8304386,"One word, worst
I would have given 0 star, please don't waste money on this crap."
tt8304386,"Despite negative reviews watched it for DQ its not that much bad a portrayed, light hearted fun movie with not so preachy message at the end, music is good, DQ and cricket Team acted well, Zoya character should have been played by some better actor.Go for it if you are free and just wanna Netflix & chill!"
tt8304386,What was the team thinking while making this movie? It's a complete torture for 2.5 hours. Third class acting by third grade actress Sonam Kapoor. She keeps beating her own records in worse acting. Not worth even a penny.
tt8304386,"I read the reviews here from others before watching the movie. There are many negative reviews here. The IMDB score is 4.2 and I usually never watch a movie below the rating of 6. But I decided to make an exception in this case because I love Dulquer. :) So, needless to say I did not have high hopes before watching.Halfway through watching the movie with my wife and daughter, I was looking at their faces. I was trying to check with them to see if I am imagining my delight at seeing the movie or was I crazy? They seemed to echo my delight. I was waiting for the movie to fail just like the reviews. But it never happened. The movie was just superb! DQ nailed it and Sonam Kapoor did an amazing job as Zoya. I loved the rest of the cast too of cricket team, Zoya's brother and dad.I feel the movie's current IMDB rating and negative reviews are totally unjustified. I am happy to see this movie and I would highly recommend to anyone who is thinking of watching it."
tt8304386,"""The Zoya Factor"" Hindi movie.
This is a romance drama picturized in the cricketing background, based on the book by Anuja Chauhan.Dulquer Salman as the Indian cricket team captain- Nikhil Khoda, struggling against all odds to keep the team united for winning ways and Sonam Kapoor as Zoya Singh, a girl from middle class army family working in an advertising agency, accidentally get entangled with the cricket team. The team suddenly relates their winning streak to the association with Zoya.Script has handled the superstitious ways of the players, very well. Second half script has an uncanny similarity with Malayalam movie 'Baktha janamgalude Sradhakku', where Zoya has been accepted by the general public as a God person.This female centric movie unfolds, in a narrative pattern. Over expressions by Zoya is childish and sometimes, irritating.
Director lost his theme, half way through, hence presentation made a radar less progression.5.5 on 10 for this love-drama-sports movie, where neither love is tuned well, nor drama is serious or the sports is played well.
Screenplay drags a lot, in most of the areas.The only reason I strongly recommend, for you to watch this movie is, the scene where hero proposes to the heroine. Great dialogues, great script, during that scene... Rest, all pass time.Superstitions Vs Hard work, is the debate.
Even though, we do all the hard work, we love to give the credit to our LUCKY CHARM."
tt8304386,This movie is just based off Sonam and not based about the cricket team? SHAME OF YOU ABHISHEK SHARMA. DQ DOES NOT HAVE A BIG ROLE. SONAM KAPOOR IS 100% OVERACTING QUEEN!
tt8304386,Again same third class love story watch Hollywood movies Bollywood is now the day bakwas
tt8304386,Im a dq fan but to be honest to say this is one of the worst movie ever of his career.. waste .. poor script.
tt8304386,"Dulqar is one of the best actor i knew not only in malayalm industry but over all,but im too disappointed to see him working with Hindi Films is that achievement????hes having a great name in malayalam industry but he seems interested to ruin that.If im not a huge fan of zoya factor i may not be in theater honestly.
okay ZOYA FACTOR! a kiddish movie for teenagers,kids who nver fall in love mush watch it.,yes its intense love story with no twist,Dulqar is just amazing actor and in this movie its not his level.....This is Dulqar Factor not a ZOya FctorS"
tt8304386,The writers and directors have done no proper research. A old story recycled again and again.
tt8304386,"OMG what a bad movie that was, from story to direction to the acting everything was crappy. And still it was not the worst part of the movie. The worst part of the movie was the dialogues, oh my God it felt like the writer went out of idea and hence gave his 5 years old kid to write the same. It was so bad commentary during the matches that I now have a huge respect for Siddhu paaji. Sonam should finally quit acting after watching this movie, I mean my 3 years old son fakes cry better than her. Please don't go for the movie, it sucks to the core."
tt8304386,"The Zoya Factor stars Sonam Kapoor and Dulquer Salmaan in lead roles.Sonam Kapoor is believed to be lucky for cricket, as she was born the day India won the World Cup in 1983, or so her father believes.Sadly, this luck has not translated into her life, as her boyfriend dumps her.
However, her luck changes when she is sent to shoot an ad with the Indian cricket team.The team discovers that Zoya is their lucky mascot and are more than excited to have her around for their matches.Dulquer Salmaan works hard to save the movie but fails.The Zoya Factor could have been more entertaining and crisp...but it works only in parts.THE ZOYA FACTOR is a feel-good simple entertainer..., not a great movie but one can watch it once with Smile."
tt8304386,Cricket + rom com is perfect date movie IMHO. DQ made a great captain and Sonam looked amazing. The cricket commentary was hilarious! Didn't expect the Anil Kapoor cameo and SRK's voice over! Why are people hating on this lol
tt8304386,"Could not finish watching till the end. As usual poor acting by Sonam Kapoor, the plot is not interesting. The lead actor gives decent support, but nothing can help the movie."
tt8304386,I saw the movie before getting biassed by reviews and IMDb rating.I laughed throughout the movie. All the characters played their roles perfectly. Zoya was the best.Post the movie my wife told me that the movie was a terrible flop. I fail to understand why 😏😏
tt8304386,"Overacting, forced humour, juvenile script.I wonder if such formula films make enough money to encourage directors and producers to continue making such mediocre films.Sonam Kapoor has done exactly the same role as all her other films. She should do something different otherwise she has been put in a typecast of acting, which is now irritating to watch.Story is good, but could have been made in a taut and much better way."
tt8304386,The most pathetic movie ever made. Even race 3 was better
tt13667212,"This is the reason that some movies are just throw-aways. Nothing tied it all together and actually though I've seen Cha In-pyo in other films and such, this was a payday for the cast and crew.His character is supposed to resuscitate a failing career, but it was like watching a stagnant pool of water...it just is there."
tt13667212,"Other shows and movies have done better at executing this concept... the main vehicle for his self analysis is to wild that I kind of was hoping for the bad outcome to happen, then it would make it bit more entertaining. I think it was smart that the wife only lent her voice to this project. It did have some funny moments but the how it got to that situation then takes me out it."
tt13667212,"I get that image literally means everything for Korean celebrity, but to take it this much even for a (bad) comedy standpoint it just fells absurd."
tt13667212,"I really thought that this would be a comedy but I was disappointed when I quickly realised how ridiculous the main character was - valuing his image over his life. And he's not even likable! In fact, I found him insufferable. I started skipping scenes when he yet again refused to be rescued by anyone else apart from his manager. So stupid."
tt13667212,"Enjoyed this. Interesting premise, if a little haphazardly crafted together.2021's 'What Happened to Mr. Cha?' is a film that is about real life South Korean actor Cha In-pyo, who plays himself. It's nothing like a biopic, but it apparently mixes fiction and non-fiction. It's a comedy, first and foremost. It does attempt a little bit of heart, but its main intention is to entertain.Does it? Yes, just about. The main event of the film is amusing and fairly unique, at least from what I've seen. I did begin to lose interest at around the midway point, as it gets repetitive, but there's enough there to keep it chugging along at a solid level. The humour, though fine, could've been greater.Cha is entertaining in the lead role. He is very much the standout performer, though I found Jo Dal-Hwan and a few of the others satisfactory too.The plot is ludicrous, but that's what the film is going for. Overall it is nothing all that incredible, but I found enough enjoyment with it."
tt13667212,First I watched it at random. Then my sister and I watched. Then my adult son and I watched. We all laughed almost continuously. Aging gracefully is no picnic.
tt13667212,It was cool foolishness. that had a great time pass
tt13667212,"Someone who has to always look good - who always has to be on the top of his game. Who seems unable to poke fun at himself. Who takes himself way too seriously. And someone who falls on his face for exactly that. And then some - but the character development in this and where the story takes us, is quite incredible to say the least.Yes I am sucker for movies that try and dare to be different and that is exactly what this movie does. I was trying to guess where this was going to go next. Is it flawed? Are some things (if not most) borderline ridiculous? Of course they are. But it is fun to see what they came up with. And the actors are brilliant in selling whatever the script gave them to work with.If you care about Mr. Cha - and that is more than important to say the least, you are in for a treat. A weird treat, but a treat nonetheless."
tt8005118,"House party the 2023 remake of the very funny 1990 original does have an interesting premise, a high school student and his friend are having a house party at his home while his parents are away, but what it doesn't have in the remake is one thing, the charm, the script and the performances, because the acting is not very good, the screenplay is just useless d.c. Young fly is embarrassing in the role and everything else is just pointless to the t, this is a useless and ill conceived remake of a very good classic, the two actors are no kid and play and don't have chemistry, they are unfunny and have zero to work with, this is a pointless film and is heading on my list of one of the worst movies of the yearstick to the original house party from 1990 and dump this one."
tt8005118,"House Party is a remake of the 1990 film of the same name. This remake is directed by Calmatic, who himself is more known for directing music videos by various music artists.The film is about Damon (Tosin Cole), who is not financially strong. In fact, his financial situation is so bad that he can hardly afford to pay for his house anymore. Together with his friend Kevin (Jacob Latimore), she tried to make money cleaning houses.When they also lose this job, they decide to throw a house party at the last house they cleaned: LeBron James' house. Knowing that LeBron won't be coming home, the two friends throw a big party at his house and try to make money from it. The house party seems to be a financial success at first, but when things start to get out of hand, things change for the two friends.In addition to the beginning directing work of the more musical video clip director, this remake is also written more by musical writers. The writers have done more writing for a short musical TV film and a series. They know how to process their musical knowledge well and appropriately in this remake with comedy that responds to this. Unfortunately, further comedy comes across less and here it can sometimes be seen that this remake is the work of novice people in the film world. This sometimes makes it seem more like you are suddenly watching images from an animated film or series such as Family Guy. With some more experienced writing and a better comedy background, this movie could have been better and more comedic.Tosin Cole and Jacob Latimore try to carry the film as the leads, but due to the less written script, their characters don't always come out as fun to really follow as the leads. Because of this, you also don't always care about their characters when they find themselves in a new problem again. They also know how to fill the film with entertaining cameos from famous people, especially people from the music world. Most of these people get little to do with their time in the movie besides providing some extra comedy."
tt8005118,"The original had heart and some decent laughs in some really funny situations. Kid N Play we're perfect and that movie was just perfect with its supporting cast. Many of those cast members went on to the Friday franchise and relied on humor not stupidity. The music was great and that movie's director went to direct Eddie Murphy's Boomerang.No clue why they messed with an already perfect low brow comedy that worked. I guess LeBron figured if he puts his name on something it sells. Well, that might work if what he's doing is any good. First he screwed up SpaceJam and now House Party. I gotta quit giving his ""entertainment"" a chance when it simply sucks.This time around the director is Known for music videos and is out of his league making movies. This is basically one long music video that relies on its two leads who I guess are real life rappers. They break into LeBron James home and decide to party by inviting everyone. Yup, a multimillionaire's home, in a well to do neighborhood gets invaded by folks we're supposed to believe will have no issues blending in to a wealthy community. Um yaAnyhow there were a few chuckles and some decent music but not enough to carry 100 minutes. Instead it's like watching a pimp my ride or mtv cribs episode. Even the music just isn't original enough to capture what the 1990 movie had. Im all for a remake, but it's got to be better than the original. Save your money with this one."
tt8005118,"House Party is a cultural significant classic film full of amazing music, great casting, a touching story and the promise of maturity. This 30 year old reboot has none of that.No one in this movie is likeable. Nothing about this movie is funny and there is zero redemption for the story or characters. The premise is dumb, the acting is weak and the direction is a perfect example of why black cinema can never get off the ground.This is not only possible the worst reboot of all time, it is without a doubt one of the worst films of all time. They try to spice this up with the occasional call back or cameo but there is no saving this film. In the end, it feels like a On Demand movie, but anyone who paid for this would be expecting a refund.I don't know who signed off on this, but it is 100% trash!"
tt8005118,"As remakes or tributes go, this missed so many marks. It had so much promise (the concept and original set a high expectation standard). But there were too many cringe worth moments to mention... the anticipated dance, the mock of Full Force, the high DJ, the random fight scene!? It just started off the mark and continued down that track for the entire film. Cameos we're cool, but seemed out of place in such a lacklustre movie.Some elements were ok, but the attempt to almost one up the original didn't set this film apart or act as a
Fitting tribute.Long story short.... Some things should be left well enough alone, and respected for what it is/was."
tt8005118,"House Party is a sacred hood classic, it did NOT need a reboot, and certainly not this terribly scripted, acted, should have been on Tubi film. I want my time back, and the $19.99 that I paid to stream it. Tosin Cole's character, Damon was beyond annoying, he was almost intolerable. I usually enjoy Jacob Latimore, however his character was flat, one dimensional, and predictable. Don't even get me started on Kid Cudi and that whole descent into the underworld of Hollywood, what even was that, and what did it have to do with anything? Also the three guys who were supposed to be the new brothers (Stab, PeeWee, and Zilla) were too over the top. Don't even get me started on LeBron! We get it, you're great, we didn't need this unnecessary reboot to remind us all of your greatness. It was basically a love letter to himself. This film was abysmal. Leave our classics alone, no one asked for this."
tt8005118,"""House Party"" may have been given a shiny new coat of paint, but it's hard to shake off the feeling that something is missing. The nostalgia is definitely there, with nods to the original film and a star-studded cast, but the heart and soul of the first movie seems to have been lost in the transition. The chemistry between Damon and Kevin is definitely enjoyable, and the party scenes are filled with energy, but the film's attempts to appeal to a new generation come across as forced and inauthentic. The cameos are definitely a highlight, but the jokes and references sometimes fall flat, and the storyline feels a bit too similar to the first movie. Overall, ""House Party"" is a fun and nostalgic romp, but it doesn't quite live up to the original."
tt8005118,"I hope the original guys got paid for the disgrace of the original movie. There were cameos / name drops to update it, but the story line was veered of a lot. The fun, realistic movie was replaced by, what I assume cheap writers, in ridiculous scenarios and completely left the fun, lovable movie to worse than their last House Party - out to make money. The worst part is that LaBron and others might have teens watch it and not the amazing original that was anti drugs/alcohol. This movie was awful and made drugs ok. Use of racial language is also in the movie. The ending is stupid and I hope the original three gets paid for this crap."
tt8005118,"I've been complaining for a while that comedy movies have become extinct. They still make some movies that are part comedy like Bullet Train and Glass Onion, but comedy is always the secondary or tertiary genre. I've been starving for more straight-comedies.I went into House Party without watching a trailer. I'm really happy I did because it took me for a ride. Finding out the hook during the movie was so much more satisfying than seeing it in the trailer. I had a blast with this movie. It's hilarious and awesome.Comedy is subjective, so this may not be for everyone. Some people will find it too silly. For me, it's exactly what I wanted. It's the right amount of over-the-top like I love. I was cracking up frequently, smiling the rest of the time.As for the movie overall, I really enjoyed the experience of going through the story with these characters. There are so many memorable scenes and moments. So many times I shook my head at what I was watching, in the most amused way possible.It's not even two weeks into 2023, yet I'm fairly certain I found one of my favorite movies of the year. Watch this in theaters so we can possibly see the return of comedy movies.(2 viewings, opening Thursday 1/12/2023, 5/21/2024)"
tt8005118,"So I can't compare it to that, but on its own merits, it's not as bad as the critics say. Especially comparing this to the movie I just saw before this one, Shotgun Wedding, which was really bad. Plus, you can tell most of this film's budget was spent on the celebrity cameos' green-room rider requirements, instead of hiring better writers and director. Nevertheless, all the cast seemed like they were actually having a good time, and all the performances were fairly decent and convincing. There were a bunch of actual laugh out loud moments, and there was decent fluidity in the screenplay, albeit fairly predictable. Overall, it was a decent and fun one-time watch. I just wish we saw more of Snoop and some of the other celebrity cameos instead of for mostly just a few seconds."
tt8005118,"I needed this. I've been watching too many good movies lately. I needed to sit through a clunker.You know what to expect with something like this. So to call this movie bad wouldn't be fair. It delivers on its promise, kind of. The promise being, try and pull some zany stunt, face some troubles along the way, laughter ensues, happy ending, and cut to credits.The thing about promises is that, they are hardly ever kept. This movie is no different. It's very clear that the actors tried their best, but they just couldn't hack it. It felt like they were trying to evoke the spirit of the 1990 House Party, and fell flat on their faces. It felt so forced and unnatural, and that projected itself on my TV screen. They tried too hard to mix in the 90s vibe with the present social media obsession.The one very entertaining part about this movie was the whole Kid Cudi situation. He was just funny, and stole every scene he was in, especially the last scene of the movie.This movie is a skip. But I could see someone watching this on those days when they are at home sick and need to kill some time.This gets a LennyReviewz Score of: 2/10."
tt8005118,"I don't know what I just watched, but the beginning of this movie was unamusing due to all the jokes flopping; I felt a bit of secondhand embarrassment. Unfortunately, Damon "" Tosin Cole,"" one of the protagonists, leads the charge of bad jokes by being so forceful and not relatable.Is it getting awkward in here?The movie could have developed a sense of a plot; as a viewer, you know it is about a house party, but where is the substance? It is as if they spent all their money on one-liner cameos. It felt like they just through a whole bunch of things together. Therefore, it was clunky and didn't make sense, and this doesn't even consider the weird climax twist with Kid Cudi and the Illuminati; what was that about?Is this House Party or a medieval special?Lebron was happy to say the ""N"" word on camera.The movie tried to incorporate aspects from the original House Party and pay homage to 90's films while incorporating current Instagram comedians. But it didn't work or feel meaningful; this is garbage.Ultimately this was a waste of a movie theater trip. I will never watch this movie again. I laughed more at how awkward it was compared to the actual jokes. House Party felt like a tv special movie with some big names attached to it. This was the actor's first time trying to do a comedy special.Grade: F."
tt8005118,"I lasted 38 minutes. How did this even make it to a 2nd take?! This is the worst movie I have (tried) to see in a very long time. The worst actors, the worst dialogue, the worst script, and by far the worst idea! I normally give movies time to get settled when I see they are bad from the getgo, but this one was NOT getting anywhere. I just couldn't get passed that 38th minute. What a way to ruin a budget and waste people's time. The original is a classic! How did they even make this one? Just the thought of doing what these guys decided to do is enough to stop watching, but again, I normally give it a chance, and I did, until minute 38. That was IT for me!"
tt8005118,"This was nothing but a quick cash grab of a mess. Unlikeable main characters who surround themselves with female hood rats that resemble back in the day 42nd street hookers. I didn't laugh once, this is no tribute to the original House Party movies, it's a disgrace. Anyone who gave this disaster good reviews must be huge LeBron fans or maybe his family members.... Oh wow, not enough characters to write this review? I can't come up with anymore things to say about this piece of.... hold on.... What!? I have 89 more characters to go? Please don't waste your time watching this movie unless you need background noise to sleep!"
tt8005118,"First it was Space Jam and now this. Almost nothing about this movie made any sense other than Bron showcasing his narcissism. The story was choppy and at times didn't make any sense. I mean, I'm not expecting Shakespearian level writing here, but this movie makes the original look like Hamlet. There were a few chuckles throughout, but nothing memorable. In the end, this was really just another vanity project from LeBron. Even with just a few minutes of total screen time, he still managed to linger over the entire movie like a wet Taco Bell fart. This movie lacked structure, continuity, and direction. Most of all, it lacked heart."
tt8005118,"Worst remake ever in history! Going to see this movie was the most biggest mistake of my life! I mean the acting part was mediocre and corny. It's like watching a train on Wreck with a bunch of unskilled people. Watching YouTube is better than watching this awful movie! If I coulda gave no stars on here I would but you know how they do it on these reviews, you at least have to give one star in order to write your review. People please don't even waist your time by going to the movies to watch this awful mess. You might as well turn on Netflix or Hulu if you really want to be entertain by some."
tt8005118,"LIKES:The Story Component To A Bit
-Surprisingly, the movie has a few surprisingly deep moments to the characters past the usual stone comedy.-The main characters have the aspect of friendship I understand, alongside having great motivations with some surprises along the way.-I got the brotherhood that we see in the moments, and the tests of loyalty/family.-I get the love of things and people and appreciated the challenges they had, even if they were worked out too easily.-And there are some other elements that are a bit surprising and again, sort of work for entertainment and big picture. It teaches lessons, adds devices, and helps to keep the comedy spin on things, but yet elevating to a more engaging piece. So that is awesome for me.Some of the Jokes Nail The timing and Are perfect
-There are times where I was losing it with laughter. A timed joke that hits the elements of delivery with that right timing
-Several of these jokes have build-up, engaging and setting it up for a time later before laying that haymaker on you to knock you out with laughter.-Others are just so random and awkward that you can't help but laugh at the delivery and making the simple words really feel like a perfect punch.-I love the outtakes as well, because it kind of is as silly as the movie itself and even those have just enough teasing to be fun.-These moments are the parts that helped me enjoy the movie most and get through some of the lesser enjoyable parts.Two Particular Scenes
-One is about dancing, which you expect at a party. It integrates the talents of the group, adds some great music, brings the mood of the party with it, adds a few cameos, and is just fun.-That dance scene is the magic I love when they are able to bring comedy, craziness, and all the themes together, and really break out so much in one move.-The second scene I can't say much, but it's a nice little, if stupid, tangent that offers even more comedic prowess.-It gets away from the drug humor, and brings a darker twist, that though laughable, uncomfortable, and downright disturbing at times.-But, it takes a break, throws a curve ball, and adds a few more comedic styles to the mix that make it really, really, really good and once more brings some fun cameos to the mix.-These two moments are the part that know how to utilize the stupidity of this movie right, and the satire, though a little over the top, is welcome compared to a lot of the other movie's theatrics.Some of the Music
-The audience I watched this with, really got into all the songs that they blasted through the speakers. I can't say I blame them.-The songs I knew, that had the amazing beats, were the ones I really loved. Others, not so much, but if you know the attitude and love the songs no matter what type of lyrics or groove they have, you'll love the film.-Even more, the songs sometimes are used again as a set up for jokes, and twice used for story purposes which only makes me appreciate them more when I see them use it to that level.The Cameos
-One of my friends who saw this, said it best, ""The Cameos make the movie.""
-House Party takes all the cameos it can, and runs with them, often timing some of the best jokes with them showing up.-The casual jokes, the awkward one-liners, the stupidity of the moment just said right, and sometimes more, are what they do with the big celebrities showing up.-When you see the energy and add the starstruck moments to it, it really helps sell the moment well and poke fun at the entertainment tropes we've come to make.-Like Family Guy in the early stages, this movie's use of just about every star they could muster, really hits the themes and tone of this movie so well that it sometimes overtakes the rest of the story they were trying to make.-Still that was enjoyable to me and worth the biggest praise for me in this film.DISLIKES:Most of the Characters
-Many of these characters might be ""real"", but they aren't very likeable, quality, or really enjoyable for me until the end.-The darker tones of the comedy, alongside the idiocy of their actions make it so that you kind of hope they get busted to stop the reckless behavior.-And it isn't' until the end that the growth occurs, but it's hasty, simplistic, and pretty much pointless given they don't do much with it and sort of overwrite with the ending montage.-For those who want characters with a little diversity and compassion, you are going to have few options to be honest, so just be warned if you haven't made the connections or have the hopes.The Antagonists:
-Many comedies have a good antagonist to enjoy in some form or manner. Home Alone, Goodfellas, Baywatch, even Beverly Hills Cop, have those bad guys that are bad and you know it.-House Party though, is just sad, stupid and boastful buffoons who are so overacted comedy it does nothing but make for annoying characters to put up with.-If you latch on to the jokes, you have an angle to like it, but they just do nothing for me and almost have little need for the movie other than again cameos and over the top jokes.-The attempt at the inclusion and story is kind of pointless, and I would have found more use for them or redesigned their characters to make their purpose needed and worth having to see the few scenes where their mindless drivel was worth it.Comedy Wasn't Relevant To Me
-There are times where the comedy did so much for me, and had me laughing, but sadly that was few and far between.-This movie is certainly geared towards a limited audience and does not have the diversity of styles that other movies have done better.-If you don't have the lingo down, don't know the culture, the music, or the references they are making, then a lot of this might go over your head.-Drug humor to this extent just goes down rabbit hole of excessive and excessively dumb, almost that you should be high or drunk to really enjoy it yourself.-While the shallow characters do little to help things out, again making it boring for me as I wait for more jokes to go over my head.-Fortunately, the farther you get, the farther you get to the better moments that finally break away from this, and give you appreciation for the other stories.LeBron's Acting At Times
-Again, the man is a sport's star, and I don't expect him to win any Oscars.-But it's painful at times to watch him try to act, and see the cameos are better.-That is part of the comedy style at times, but other times, I thought it was a legitimate attempt and it crashed and burned for me.-And then they had to shovel it in too much, but hey... it's short lived so that's a plus.Some Jokes Go Way Too Far
-Sometimes it goes way too far as to being inappropriate, a dig that should have been left undug and left for a deleted scene to go and explore.-Other times it's a joke that is so stupid, you again either have to get everything, like extremes, or be intoxicated to really get the moment when you see the other things they have done.-And sometimes the jokes just keep going on and without the fresh spin, leading to again... too far.-This movie is about excess and that's the comedy style you have to like for the most part to really enjoy it.The Writing Can Be Lazy At Times
-First of all, excessive cussing to me is not good writing. It needs to be timed and selected to dominate the use of it.-Second, the jokes get stale, the awkwardness sometimes goes nowhere, and the story is so limping, confused and filled with filling that it again shows how this movie seemed to struggle in the storyboard stage.-Sure, it's stupid fun, but there are other movies that do similar aspects with a better premise to it, and this was one that just seemed to take memes and make a story from it.-As such, not really worth saying it's good writing, better at times and clever at others, but some will call me stuck-up or pretentious when the theme is supposed to be fun.The VERDICT:
House Party is what you expect, a very stupid, over the top, in your face comedy that is all about tearing up the theater with so many simplistic, in your face, and often stale tactics to get a laugh. The plus side, the movie does have those little flecks of diamonds in the gold bands of the grill, finding some great scenes and jokes that execute well. Story, characters, music, and jokes all have these grade A moments that showed what the film could have been had it been guided by the minds on these moments and helped polish some of the excessive stupidity away. But if you don't have the culture, the references appreciated, or aren't into excess, this is a comedy that might be too limited. The characters are annoying, the antics simplistic, stale, repetitive, and the direction kind of limited to condense into a timeline. Cameos are there to assist for the most part, but that was the only consistency I enjoyed to help get me through the silliness and aggressive red-brand trailer theatrics we have. If you can do all that, this movie will easily be an 8-10 for you. However, because of the other movies I've seen that do it better, this movie is a bit too geared to specific audience types for me to give it higher points. There is potential, there is fun, and there are again those perfect moments for me like the dance scene. But the excessive tide of in your face comedy does little for me given my past and lifestyle. Therefore, my scores are:Comedy: 6.0
Movie Overall: 4.5-5.0."
tt8005118,"I couldn't decide if this movie wanted to be House Party or a reboot of Friday. One thing I was sure of, is that it was definitely neither. It lacked the wit, charm, and humor of both.The original House Party was about two teens in an urban community, from blue collar families, throwing a house party when a friend's parents go out of time. Hijinks ensues when 3 high school bullies spend the night pursuing the main character, thus neatly keeping him from making it to the party. It was fun. There was the unmistakable innocence of being young. Just normal teens doing what kids do. The kids also had talent (dancing, rapping). The original movie was magical.The new House party not only lacks the charm of the original, but also lacks dignity. The actors in the roles are okay for what they had to work with. It's the directing and the writing that was abysmal. I found the slang and characters to be completely obnoxious but also unrelateable. There was no joy in the story, just mindless vapidness and swearing. We are living in an era where there's just not enough talent coming out of today's generation, and that lack talent was on full display in this movie, especially when you compare it to the original 1990 release. Kid and play danced and rapped. The ladies were clearly talented enough to hold their own on the dance floor. This new house party had nothing to offer but a bunch of young people spewing flat unrelateable jokes. For a generation that has wasted its prime years online, it almost feels like they dont know what do with themselves in the real world or how to create something other than a meme. They dont know how to be interesting, charming, or likeable. I made it halfway through and then I was done. Makes me wonder if the filmmakers even watched the original."
tt8005118,"I rarely write reviews but had to for this to set the record straight.Impossible to outdo the original let's start there. I grew up on the original and the sequel and it was the soundtrack to my life!This was what the new fresh Prince was to the original. Different but paid tribute in the right way. Funny as hell, great music, great cameos, storyline on point, I loved it. I went in not expecting anything after watching the attempt to remake how high but they nailed this. Well done to everyone involved. For one hour and 40 mins I felt like I was a teenager again. Ignore the hate, ignore the comparisons to the original, instead treat this as a tribute rather than a remake."
tt8005118,"House Party is above average with its acting, comedy, and story. The story about being two lifelong friends doing housecleaning duties for the one and only Lebron James' house. They decide on throwing a house party to have a lot of fun and make money in order to pay for bills. Overall, I liked it for the celeb appearances, a few laughs, and entertainment. There is nothing too special or too good scenes about this film since there are a lot of drugs, drinking, and profanity. It is an alright comedy film that I would recommend to watch it on either blu-ray, DVD, or streaming services. Watching in theaters was a bit of a stretch and you can skip it in the theaters if you want to."
tt8005118,"It was more dumb than anything however it had a few laughs and I mean a few, some which I could relate to but it wasn't a believable movie. I was bored a lot of the times but since I was 45 minutes in I was committed. Some of the dialog was nonsense the characters was dumb and I can tell they took secens and characters from the original house party. The Illuminati scene was not needed and a complete was of time. Plot holes and character errors was all over this movie. The only thing that was satisfying to me was all the beautiful chocolate women. I had to hit pause several times so I could get a good look."
tt8005118,"I'd be lying if I said that this reboot of House Party didn't get a handful of really good laughs out of me. But that's about all there was.At 100 minutes, the movie feels much longer than it is. Many of the same jokes are reused again and again throughout the film, not for the sake of setup and payoff, but for rehashing material, and the humor has diminishing marginal returns as the story trudges on.This is definitely a stoner comedy, as a great deal of the plot is simplistic while relying on absurdist moments thrown in for shock value. It made me laugh at times, for sure, because some of the visual gags are so unexpected. But there's only so much value in it.I appreciated the story's occasional attempts at adding character development for the two main friends as they struggle to accept each others' flaws, but this arc is so rushed through that it feels tacked on.I certainly got enough enjoyment out of this that I don't regret seeing it, but it doesn't have nearly enough good, memorable qualities to make it worth recommending."
tt11942100,3 stars for prashasti's episode otherwise it was worth 1. Everyone else was bombing and there was no meat in the jokes.
tt11942100,Done wate your time.better to watch'some movie instead of watching this.totally bakwaas
tt11942100,It's sad to see how low level content gets onto Netflix show. Youtube stand comedy is way better. Better to save time by not watching this. These are talented standups and sad to see low level show
tt11942100,"Worst content. It felt like they are just doing comedy of time in stage . What the hell. If you don't have content , then just don't do it.. more specifically the episode of kaneez was worst among all the episodes. Are those even jokes ? Lol."
tt11942100,I was really rooting for this to be good. It breaks my heart that we don't have one awesome female comic in India. All jokes looked forced. Are they doing enough open mics? Are they getting honest feedback from somewhere? I highly doubt. May be better to first become a good writer then a good stand up comic. A route many famous stand up comics have taken.
tt11942100,"If this is comedy, please spare us. There is plenty of raw talent out there. However when it comes to Bollywood etc, nepotism and contacts is what works. Not talent.A bunch of talentless comics. So-called comics."
tt11942100,"Cool series, if you want to be entertained, this would be a great chocie. Netflix did it again."
tt11942100,"Just watched it.The people who say women aren't funny are so wrong, infact I think almost all female comics are very funny except these four.Schindler's list was funnier than thisThese 4 would make efficient terrorists cuz they must bomb every nightAll your jokes are from personal experiences is that why ur punchlines are sad?This was so unfunny that u should pay Netflix just to take this downThis was so bad that I'm even trying to suspect that The expression needle in a haystack was coined just to describe punchlines in ur setThe only thing funny about this is that Netflix actually paid u to record thisU guys were confident ,well dressed,the place was excellent, basically it had everything except jokesThis was so bad that whenever someone says that women artists aren't getting enough opportunities I just show them this"
tt11942100,Waste of time and what the hell Netflix. Kindly do a little homework before starting a show if it is gonna get you good feedback
tt11942100,"I watched this show out of order. The Coimbatore girl was not bad. With some more confidence and better delivery, she can be real good. My first time watching Prashasti and I thought she was pretty good. I like that she's a girl from a small town doing standup in the big city, easily switching between Hindi punchlines that land and not-held-back narratives in English. I have seen Kaneez perform a few times and I can't help but wonder ""Girl, what's your plan B? Coz, this standup thing isn't really working out for you"". I would have liked to say that in this show, she turned me. But she didn't. Sorry, I couldn't be bothered to get to the 4th chick. This was hard."
tt11942100,"It is a Netflix original standup comedy special with four comedians taking the centre stage. Each episode lasting 15 minutes.It features Prashasti Singh, Kaneez Surka, Supriya Joshi and Niveditha Prakasam. I found Prashasti and Niveditha's set the best among the lot. Kaneez's was the weakest and that is surprising as she is the famous one in the lineup.What I liked about these comedians are they crack joke on themselves and are confident about it. In the sets of each comedian, there were so many A rated jokes especially with sexual context. I don't have problem with it but I like sets presented by Akash Gupta, Gurleen Pannu etc which has relatinility to another level and even if there's sexual innuendo it is such beautifully integrated in their script.Niveditha's jokes fell flat at places was because she was taking about South Indian stuff which wasn't relatable or understandable to her audience but they were funny as I could understand. The comedians should write their set keeping audience in mind where she definitely needs more experience.It is very short and you wanna have some laugh you definitely could try it. #pranureviews #LadiesUp #LadiesUpReview."
tt11942100,"Thanks to Netflix specials like these, sometimes I wonder why am I still subscribed to them. Terrible piece of stand up comedy."
tt1261945,"A lot of people exercise their brains with puzzles found in the newspaper. Sudoku is a prime example. The variety published by a typical paper can usually be solved in less than 5 minutes, or at least that's been my experience with them. The goal for me was to grab an issue of The Kansan, take a seat in class, and have the Sudoku finished before learning was to commence. I didn't have class every day, so when I didn't need the Sudoku I kept the paper. A small pile sits next to me as I type this review. I never got to working a single puzzle after graduating; I found that writing and talking about movies was a more suitable exercise for me. It seems that the worse the movie in question, the more mistakes there are to find. For that reason alone, Sex and the City 2 is a good brain teaser.The adventure begins when Carrie Preston (Sarah Jessica Parker) and friends Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), Charlotte (Kristin Davis), and Samantha (Kim Cattrall) attending the wedding of their best gay friends. Since this is based on a long running TV series, I'm sure fans of the show found more significance to the scene than I did. In my eyes it was the most logical way to present Liza Minnelli as herself singing Beyoncé's ""Single Ladies"". It's a scene that can't be unseen, and I knew instantly that it would haunt me for the rest of the summer. Everyone at the wedding makes Carrie feel bored with her life now that she's settled down with Mr. Big (Chris Noth). The most bizarre way this is accomplished is by having a random couple tell them they will be lonely if they don't have children. Then wouldn't you know it, something ridiculous happens and the girls get flown to Abu Dhabi where they are treated like royalty all because some sheik wants Samantha work a PR campaign for his property. But don't worry, our leading ladies forget about any logical objective and proceed to flaunt what they got in the desert.I realize this movie didn't have me in mind when it was created. This is my first experience with the girls of Sex and the City and from what I gathered I can see why an hour-long TV program running on premium cable would be a hit. These girls are rude, and vulgar, but they play off of each other like champs. When they are seated at a table gossiping is when Sex and the City 2 shows any hint of a shine. The problems then smudge that polish.I've never seen so many costume changes. I'm convinced it's the driving point behind the narrative. Every scene is constructed to show what Carrie and the girls can put on then lead to another situation for them to dress up. No movie should be so shallow, and even worse they look flammable and toxic. I wasn't sure if the running gag is that Carrie doesn't know she looks like a low rent streetwalker, there's a sign of trouble if ever there was one.No care is shown with the characters. Samantha sleeps with absolutely any guy regardless of the situation, and the outcome is too much to stomach. Miranda has a subplot about needing to balance work and family which gets lost in a sea of plunging necklines. Charlotte frets about her husband cheating on her with their nanny every 10 minutes. Lastly, Carrie is simply too selfish to be likable. She has a husband who seems to be doing a fantastic job by everyone else's standards. To her, he needs to do more and this sets her up for a lamebrain, and oddly predictable, encounter with an old flame.The wanton excess of this movie leaves no doubt as to why the world hates us. Sex and the City 2 is a better terrorist motivational tool than it is an enjoyable time at the theatre. These girls are easily living the life in New York before the film takes its sweet time to send them to the Middle East where everything is ratcheted up to 11. They each get a personal Maybach 62 S so they can be chaffered to and from locations where they can offend locals and change clothes. There's an occasionally clever line but that won't vindicate watching it."
tt1261945,Anyone watching this in 2020 cause of quarantine just to see if its as cringey as you remember? No? Just me? Ok
tt1261945,"My sister and I were so excited about going to this movie. With the recession, the loss of jobs and general pessimism of late - the thought of dressing up, drinking cocktails and watching a great movie in the company of a whole room full of women like us was excellent. We desperately wanted to love the movie.Initially, everyone seemed to be in good form – a bit of a cheer when Mr. Big came on screen; gasps and giggles in response to the first few jokes.then uncomfortable silence. My sister squirmed in the seat beside me through the horrible 'I am woman' song. Having visited the Middle East myself (and enjoyed the cultural experience and friendly people; albeit with a different outlook on life) I was pretty appalled at the blatant lack of propriety exercised by the four.I have to admit when the movie ended, all the women around me turned to each other and said it was 'great' – I don't think we were ready to admit that it was possibly the biggest disappointment ever. My sister and I had planned to talk about the outfits and scenarios afterwe completely avoided the topic. We had all looked forward to this movie – we couldn't admit to ourselves (never mind anyone else) that it was awful.To say I loved the original show is an understatement. As I enter my late twenties/early thirties, the reruns are even more relevant. The characters in the show discussed sexuality in a fresh, exciting way. They were women you could look up to – intelligent, confident, self-assured. They bear zero resemblance to the four self-indulgent, disrespectful, two dimensional creatures I had to watch.I doubt any fan will take my advice and not go – I would have ignored it myself. The movie seems to symbolise everything that has gone wrong lately – by blindly pursuing materialism we lose what's really important. This movie spells that out – and leaves you feeling ashamed for having loved them so much in the first place. Having said that, I watched an episode in the series a night later and realised that, actually, I'm not an idiot – they used to discuss interesting, relevant issues – just in fabulous clothes.As an aside, I spent an hour with my sister getting all dressed up to go, two hours chatting to her before we watched the horror show and four hours after dancing our socks off. Maybe the fact that was the best part means I have my priorities right after all."
tt1261945,"I AM female. I love to watch a good chic-flick. However, I was so disappointed. This movie has little to offer except constantly changing 'bizarre' costuming presented as high fashion and thoroughly embarrassing 'ugly American' scenes of over-indulged, entitled and rudely written characters. I went to the theater to enjoy a fun movie. I came away shaking my head. The movie was disrespectful to me as an American woman. Who acts like Samantha when in a foreign country, the Middle East or otherwise? As I watched the characters make total asses of themselves I was embarrassed for them simply sitting in the theater. It's no wonder other countries believe Americans lack respect for everyone and everything. Hollywood apparently does and wants everyone to know it. Unfortunately, the general public is judged by Hollywood--the American delivery system. It's not worth the money to see it. If you can get it on DVD for a buck, then judge for yourself."
tt1261945,"WARNING: a few *small* spoilers.The previous review says it all - but I still feel it necessary to add my two cents.I, too, was a huge fan of the series...if only because the characters were interesting, and it was so refreshing to listen to realistic female characters discuss taboo topics such as sex.I forced myself to watch the first movie. That was bad. This one...even worse. The characters have become utterly superficial, materialistic (in a way that's practically nauseating given the current state of the economy) - and completely 2 dimensional. The writing - cartoony and juvenile. Honestly, Carrie's the worst - the way the character acted in the film, I would personally have recommended that Mr. Big file for divorce. (Complaining because he wants to stay home and watch movies together, then forcing him to leave a party--that she dragged him to--early because he had a conversation with another woman?) Jeez.As for Samantha - that character's gone completely over the top - sex crazed in a way that went way past racy and into plain vulgar. Combine that with the incongruity of throwing the characters into a completely unrealistic situation (heading to Abu Dahbi?), and then disrespect that they show to Arab culture....well, this movie COULD NOT have been worse. Thank goodness that there's no way they'll make STC3. At least, I really, really hope not. How this ever could have been green lighted for production is totally beyond my comprehension."
tt1261945,"I watched the first film as someone who had only ever casually watched the show and didn't really care to do more than that. The first film didn't get the wit of the show but did try to have a bit of substance to it in some regards, even if it didn't work. The second film feels like someone has taken the decision that this should be more of an ""event"" than a film so instead of worrying too much about story and characters, what we should have is just an endless OTT parade of wealth. Very much like the wedding that opens it, the film is constantly excessive, gaudy and unnecessary. Some will love it for this as some sort of guilty pleasure but I'm not sure if it is what fans or casual viewers will warm to.My understanding of the show was that, while it did have the wealthy and free of the NYC fashion world as its main characters, it did keep itself connected to reality for the majority of viewers so that, while some of it was big city fantasy, it did still have a realism and wit in regards friendships and relationships that viewers could relate to. There is none of that in this film, instead the characters (themselves living in comfort and wealth) are granted access to a world of extreme luxury that takes them far from reality and makes them pretty unlikeable and patronising for the majority of the time. In terms of plot there is not a lot going on. Each character has their own little thread and mostly they amount to very little since the majority of the time is spent with them enjoying their luxury. There are some smaller moments of potential (Miranda and Charlotte being honest about motherhood with one another) that are good but they are lost in the luxury and the long run time as our characters just run from one glamorous location to another.Anything that is close to a plot is handled badly whether it be a device or a relationship theme. The loss of Carrie's passport is ""put out there"" in the middle of the film only to be resolved within seconds and used for a terribly pointless conclusion. Her relationship quandary (about not seeing her husband a few days a week) is nonsense (since she has issues with it the day before jetting off for weeks) and is also discussed in the most patronising way, with Carrie drawing from the example of her private butler having joy in only seeing his wife once a month (missing that he can only do this because he has to work all the time, serving people like Carrie, as opposed to it being a relationship choice). The thing about the nanny goes nowhere and is resolved with a piece of throwaway titillation (excuse the pun) that is as vapid as the character.Although the majority of viewers will not be offended by it, it has to be said that SaTC2 is an incredibly insensitive film considering where it was made. In principle I have no issue with the ""these women are just like us"" message but when it is made in as clunky and unrealistic manner as it is in this film then it is hard not to scoff at it. Likewise the constant suggestion that the women of the Middle East are oppressed is badly done and only made worse by having Western ""liberation"" ""celebrated"" by having Samantha wearing a revealing outfit, simulate sexual intercourse in a crowd of men heading to morning prayers – I'm really not sure what part of that scene was not designed to cause religious offense.The cast go with it but outside of the brief moments some of them get to be characters (eg discussing motherhood) none of them do anything of note. Much has been said of Parker's looks that is unfair and irrelevant to the film – her job as an actress is not to physically appeal to the viewer. However, it is hard to overlook this aspect when the film spends so much time troweling her in makeup to the point where she looks ridiculous. Her narration musings are so superficial that her delivery only sounds the same. Cattrall tries to be the Samantha she always was but it doesn't work and the material misses the chance to do anything smart or progressive with her; she is also hurt by having the lions' share of the culturally and religiously insensitive material and having to sell it as her being ""right"". Davis and Nixon have even less to do than these two, which is a shame because they both come over as the more natural and realistic of the four. The male cast are again mostly plot devices, although I thought that Noth's Big was a better character than normal – although maybe I just felt sorry for his situation here? SaTC2 doesn't have the decency to be a car-crash of a film, the sort of thing that you watch aghast, but nor is it any good whatsoever. It is gaudy, superficial, overlong, offensive, and full of missed potential and bad ideas. Removed from the City of the title and placed into a world of extreme opulence the film also pushes the fantasy so far that it prevents any meaningful connection for the casual viewer (which the show used to be able to do). I doubt that even fans of the show will be happy with this film."
tt1261945,"I have just been to the Cinema watching Sex and The City 2. I must say I am originally middle eastern.To all the negative reviewers saying it was offensive to middle east, I must say I enjoyed the movie so much and it wasn't offensive at all. In my opinion, it only shows how open-minded USA is in accepting women sexuality and how close-minded Middle East is with regards to accepting sexual freedom to women. At the same time, I think they made middle east look much more glamorous than what it really is. Thanks to the power of Hollywood.With regards to the movie itself, I think it was funny, very colorful, glamorous and beautiful. I loved loved loved the clothes, the material and the fashion they used were astonishing. Yes, they magically solved all the issues without creating too much drama, but is that really that big a deal? What's wrong with knowing that sometimes, the dramas that we make for ourselves aren't really that big a deal, and there could be happy ending??I don't think they showed Carrie as a bad character and Big as a good character, they showed that men become boring after marriage, and also showed that Carrie was honest enough to admit even the slightest fling she felt with Aiden.I am not a fan of drama myself, I have loved Sex and the City TV shows for years, I own the DVDs and watch them all the time. I personally didn't like the first movie that much because I think it was very sad,, ,but the fun came back with the second movie.In my opinion: Samantha was fabulous as ever, she didn't want to change herself for anybody else, and she had the courage to stand up for herself in the middle of angry men. Miranda was brave enough to quit her job and show the hand to her abusive boss, and at the end, after taking some time off for herself, she found a better job where the atmosphere was more accepting to the person she really was. Charlotte as usual was her sensitive self, and Carrie was creating her own rules.Love the independence in these women and I hope one day I could be that independent."
tt1261945,"After seeing the first Sex and the City movie, and finding it OKAY, I decided to take a stab at the second film. I am a huge fan of the HBO series, so i was naturally excited...THE GOOD: Yes, there were some funny moments, and some nice things to look at (clothes, design, men). I liked most of the music choices, and I did enjoy the first 20 minutes or so of the film because it seemed as though it would be building up to something interesting, but just these few things alone could not have made a good enough movie for one of the best shows to ever air on television. THE BAD: This movie had a lot of downfalls. Lets start with the plot (or lack there of). The audience was treated to four women that constantly complained about their ""problems"". I am not saying that their issues were not legitimate to regular women, but they did not present these issues in a way that would create an interesting plot..they were just seemingly simple problems that were over dramatized and annoying to listen to (lackluster marriage, boring job, declining hormones, having children...) In the middle of these ""problems"" we get to see how rich they are with their maids/nannys, change of expensive clothes every 4 minutes and fancy homes. All these things made it hard to sympathize with them. Yes, in the show we saw their lavish lifestyle, but this film was rubbing it in the audience's face, and it was a main part of the ""storyline"" when it really shouldn't have been. (plus, a lot of the clothing choices were NOT good) It seemed as though they threw in the idea of going to Abu Dhabi just to make things interesting, but it just made things worse. I felt as though there was a mocking/ undermining quality to the way they portrayed middle eastern customs... But more importantly (to me) is the fact that when i think of the show and its title ""Sex in the CITY"" I think of that city as NYC, NOT Abu Dhabi (really, what were they thinking?) Overall, i felt like this was a poorly executed film that had little resemblance to the show... I feel cheated."
tt1261945,"Went into this not expecting much, the premise seemed off but wanted to see my old friends. I told myself everything you're telling yourself, well the fashion will be fun...there should be some funny stuff...might get to see a hot naked guy. I had no idea I'd robbed of my ticket money and insulted for 2 1/2 hours.I loved the series, seen every show at least 6-7 times. I thought the first movie was a little disappointing, not very much depth, just wallowing and moping for most of it.The new movie is just an exercise in self indulgence and complaining about problems that aren't really problems. Charlotte complaining about how hard it is to be her when she has a nanny AND a housekeeper. Miranda complaining that her boss doesn't like her. Carrie complaining that Big puts a TV in the bedroom. Samantha complaining about her hormones. I just kept thinking ""are you kidding me?? This passes for dialogue??"". That's all in the first 8 minutes and it's just downhill from there. I'm just disgusted.Best part of the movie? The preview for the new Rachel McAdams film that came on right before it."
tt1261945,"The popular TV series Sex and the City has ran from 1998 - 2004, spawned a movie adaptation of the series in 2008, and here's the sequel that will most likely bring it to a close in 2010. At this point, the girls are old enough for fans to not care what happens to them. But we keep coming back to see them every movie and every episode. We're so used to these characters we need them in our lives supposedly, but after this movie, my love for this show is drastically decreased. My hope for this film to be a successful follow up was brought to a tease when watching the first hour of this film.To begin with, the film has a miserable run time. Two hours and thirty minutes may work for a superhero film or LOTR prequel, but who the hell thought it would work for a Comedy about four women? The first film had the almost the same run time, though it was entertaining and it was fun to see the characters do what they did in the second film like struggle with wedding plans and try on dresses. This is jam packed with racist, stereotypical jokes about homosexuals, Jewish people, and Middle Eastern people as well. I'm sure if Prince of Persia didn't steal the subtitle, The Sands of Time, it would belong as the subtitle of SATC2.The plot is all four women are struggling with their marriages. Carrie (Parker) wants more ""sparkle"" with her man ""Big"", Charlotte (Davis) has trouble keeping her two children under control and frets the nanny (Eve) is getting too close to her husband, Miranda (Nixon) is stressed with work and not there for her kid when she needs to be, and Samantha (Cattrall) is still sleeping with the whole town. All knowing their stressed, Samantha books a vacation for the girls to fly in n extreme first class condition to the Middle East where jokes take the route for stereotypical, and the lackluster level plummets straight into the ground.Its sad to see a once brilliant series take the route of crap, but if it were to keep going on and maintain the same jokes as seen in this, it's better off dead. I said before the first movie was just as long, but interesting to see the characters get into fun mischief and have fun, intelligent talks. In this sequel, an intelligent and interesting talk is hard to come by. Every talk is followed by some bad joke or stupid sexual comment, no talk is perfect in this film.Overall, the film is mediocre and just a bore. There are some humorous scenes by Carrie and Big, but with a big name like Sex and the City, it should've been extraordinary and have been on many critics ""Best of the year"" list. Instead it makes the ""Worst of the year"" list and probably will earn the title ""The worst film of the year"" by most critics. Wouldn't surprise me if the cameo by Miley Cyrus is nominated for a Razzie Award. Lord knows the film will be too.Starring: Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, Cynthia Nixon, Alice Eve, Chris Noth, John Corbett, David Eigenberg, Evan Handler, Miley Cyrus, Penelope Cruz, Jason Lewis, Lynn Cohen, and Liza Minnelli."
tt1261945,"Once upon a time, there were four fabulous ladies from New York City who charms the world with fashion, love and sex. Thus, Sex and the City was born.In 2008, the girls had a reunion on the big screen, and it puts to an perfect ending to the series.However, in 2010, another reunion on the big screen was created, which this time round, the reunion does not seems to be enjoyable compared to the previous reunion, which brings love, trust, faith, hope and ever lasting friendship together.Welcome to Sex and the City 2, which brings fails to deliver the high expectation from fans of the popular HBO series. Love and sex remains, together with more exaggerating comical sequences, posh nosh and time consuming plot, which not only bores and sometimes frustrates audience, but also, a disappointment to the fans of Sex and the City.Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Samantha (Kim Cattral) are back together on the sequel, which begins with a list of problems they are facing in their daily life: Carrie is in doubt with Big (Chris Noth) on their marriage; Miranda faces the pressure of a chauvinistic boss; Charlotte unable to handle her two daughters growing up together, and Samantha is tackling menopause. An unexpected invitation to a holiday at Abu Dhabi for th girls allows them to enjoy themselves, and at the same time, clearing about their thoughts on their love life and marriage.Sex and the City 2 promises to be another fashion parade. However, girls don themselves with clothing unsuitable for the weather and environment in Abu Dhabi pulls the movie down, since it makes the girls looks lavish and filthy rich, rather than stylish and chic. While the latest fashion fits in perfectly in New York City, the crew has failed to consider creating clothing that fits into the environment and culture of Abu Dhabi. Thus, it does not bring out the charm the girls ought to get from wearing them, which has been displayed in the previous series.The plot seems like a typical episode of Sex and the City, but such typical plot are good for the drama series rather than the movie. The paper thin plot can be seen as a form of extension from one of the episodes, which looks rather dull and draggy. Sub plots were added in to keep the movie going, which fails to point out some of the points that can be discussed further in the movie. Instead of keeping the spirit of Sex and the City going strong, the second half of the Sex and the City 2 seems to be a farce.Discussion of culture and religion in Abu Dhabi has also diverted the spirit of the series away, which at some point, could be offensive and uncomfortable to some audience who are not prepared for it. For fans, this might be seen as a sequence that has no relation to the girl's usual talk over the coffee table.The strong support for each other and the friendship is the only saving grace for the movie, which not only ends haphazardly, but also fails to end with a big bang.In summary, director Michael Patrick King and Parker can do more to salvage Sex and the City 2. Remedy must be done to save this broken pieces of anticipated reunion in order to keep the spirits alive."
tt1261945,"I feel like I was robbed. This movie was the epitome of bad movie sequels. I cannot believe that the Sex and the City girls would stoop so low to make this film. They must be desperate! Despite the tacky clothes, plot and totally obnoxious take on the once really hip, cool and classy girls from New York, the cinematography was horrendous. I can't believe no one on this site had mentioned the fact that you could see the microphones above the actors heads in almost every scene! It was so distracting in addition to being tortured by their senseless complaining. I don't think I have ever seen such bad filming in my life! I don't make films but I certainly would make sure I didn't get any of the filming equipment on camera!This movie was awful!!!!! I want my ten dollars back!"
tt1261945,"I took a break yesterday to see SETC2, and I have to say, the reviews have it totally wrong. I thought this movie was great fun, and I actually think it was much more true to the spirit of the series than the first movie. I thought the script was classically well crafted. There were dashes of politics mixed with a Carrie-esquire look at the challenges that arise in maturing relationships, and the whole thing was wrapped in the high-fashion confection we've come to expect from the show. I felt the characters, who had wandered off to weird places in the first movie, were back in fine form--especially Samantha. There are cornball turns of phrases, insider jokes, and winks and nods, but again, this is all very much in keeping with the original HBO series. If you're expecting Fellini, then this ain't the flick for you. But you should have already had 10+ years to figure that out. If you want an eye-popping 2-1/2 hour joy ride with some old friends, then go plunk your money down worry free."
tt1261945,"In 1998, the series ""Sex and the City"" was a worldwide entertainment for men and women and for the next six years, the lives of Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte made part of my life. In 2008, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis released the disappointing feature and they should have stopped with the revival of the four New Yorkers of thirty and something years old.Unfortunately money seems to be more important than self-respect, and the quartet returns in the awful ""Sex and the City 2"". The writer of these shallow and futile adventures of four dysfunctional Americans in Abu Dhabi seems to have the mind of a thirteen year-old boy, with stupid jokes and low-level dialogs. He seems to be interested in pleasing the gay communities and might have earned some money for the free merchandising. Sarah Jessica Parker lost her charming style and now looks like an anorexic with bad taste, wearing dreadful clothing. Her infantile behavior after kissing her ex-boyfriend is probably the most ridiculous moment of the story for a forty and something years old woman. Kim Cattrall's character Samantha deserves pity for her attempt to behave like nymphomaniac low-life slut. Charlotte seems to have Cinderella's Complex and Miranda is the only character that deserves some respect. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): ""Sex and the City 2"""
tt1564585,"I don't think Skyline is a bad movie as such. While there were better movies from 2010 such as The King's Speech, The Social Network, The Fighter and Toy Story 3, there are also worse such as Fred:The Movie, The Last Airbender, Vampires Suck and Clash of the Titans.Skyline is not a good movie, but it isn't in my opinion bad either. If anything, my feelings for Skyline are very mixed. I have seen some comparisons to Battle:Los Angeles, and I do agree this is the better movie, while Skyline did have a lot of problems Battle:Los Angeles was clichéd, under-directed and over-edited and other than Aaron Eckhart, a decent idea and one or two decent scenes there was little of redeeming value.Starting with the good things of Skyline, the visuals look absolutely great. The cinematography and editing are slick, the scenery is striking and the colours and lighting are bold, but the real star is the special effects which are superb. The sound is another plus, very explosive and authentic, and the soundtrack is memorable, not too generic and fits decently with the mood. Also, the action in general is explosive and exciting.Skyline does also have its flaws though. The characters are not as clichéd or indifferent as those of Battle:LA and some of the worst of the year, but to be honest I did find some of the characterisation underdeveloped and irritating. The dialogue is often cheesy and seems to be taking an exercise in high camp, and the climax while quite freaky and atmospheric feels like a different tone to the rest of the movie and this was a tone that jarred a bit. The story in its structure is quite soap-opera-like, and can get predictable and pedestrian, the direction is sometimes good sometimes flat and the acting is also uneven ranging from over-eager to bland.All in all, Skyline was not a bad movie in my opinion, certainly not as bad as I'd heard, but it is a hardly exceptional movie either. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
tt1564585,"First, let's work on some maths: ""Skyline"" is an alien invasion flick that has a touted US$10 million budget! This amount is a shoestring for an alien attack film - it is not even enough to pay the salary of an A-list star! So now you can do the maths and understand why there are no big stars here.If you had seen the trailer you might have been impressed by the CGI effects of the tentacled UFOs. This is probably where all the money have gone. Everything else, from its lame script and B-grade TV stars to its sets, are all hotch-potch and downright rudimentary. It is an exploitation film that seems destined for DVD.Synopsis: After a night of heavy partying at a posh condo in Los Angeles, a bunch of friends are awakened in the early hours by mysterious beams of light from the skyline. Those who gaze on the light get entranced - like moths to a flame and get 'burnt up'. Yup, the alien ships have landed and the survivors at the condo unit, Jarrod (Eric Balfour) and his fiancée (Scottie Thompson, pictured below with Balfour), and their friends Terry (Donald Faison of TV's ""Scrubs"") and Candice (Brittany Daniel) must find a way to escape the aliens' grasp. But where can they run? There are so many things wrong with the movie that I don't know where to begin. The film, directed by the Brothers Strause who did the effects for ""The X-FIles"", centres the action inside the condo unit so much that we get the impression that LA is deserted and the only folks left are those in the half-empty building. No attempt is made to show the scope of the 'body snatching' and its effects on the millions of other city-dwellers.Next, the main characters are being portrayed as such selfish and unsavoury people that we root for the aliens to take them away. This may be because the writers have not bothered to flesh out their backgrounds, except for a few predictable turns. The only one who comes on as real is David Sayas (of TV's ""Dexter"" fame) who plays the building supervisor. Also, the dialogue is lame and clichéd. The writers must have had the notion that audience interest can be sustained if they have the characters yell at one another.There's no doubt that Strause brothers provide exhilarating special effects - but they need to work on getting a good story to go with their CGI magic. Otherwise it is just a damn waste."
tt1564585,"One lesson I've learned is to not read online reviews before I go see a film as I did not find this movie to be half as bad as the people on this site claim. After reading that this movie was not even worth renting and that it was the worst film ever made and then seeing it, I didn't think it came close to any of those opinions.It was far from perfect, but as far as entertainment value I was satisfied. It kept up a good pace with semi-interesting twists and turns. I even found myself to be holding onto my seat at times wondering what was gonna happen next.This movie was 10 times better than something like Sex and The City part 2 or Eat, Pray, Love. I suggest checking it out for yourself and not listening to the scathing reviews on this site."
tt1564585,"Stop me if you heard this before. Aliens invade earth and a handful of survivors try to escape their impending deaths. It's another War of the Worlds-esque invasion flick but what's nice about this is that it's played straight with no comedic one-liners and there's not a teenager in sight.Directors Colin Strause and Greg Strause are no strangers to special effects after bringing to life the Predators and Aliens in AVPR (2007) and the rest of the team behind Skyline's extraterrestrials are clearly talented making the best out of a budget. It's visually wonderful, the special effects are fantastic. Nevertheless, Aliens (1986) designers and suit wearers Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr. creature designs appear to be an unoriginal mix of The Fly, Independence Day, Cloverfield and The Matrix. The acting is above average and the leads including Eric Balour and Brittany Daniel carry the emotion well. David Zayas is notable as the Hotel manager but his screen time is limited. That said, the script lacks enough meaty dialogue to keep you enthralled and you find yourself waiting for more glimpses and shenanigans of the alien invaders.Overall, it looks great but it fails to connect and grip you as much as it should. Even so it's a lot better than critics would lead you to believe and recommended to those who don't need a stereotype hero lead, Skyline 2 is more than welcome. The Brothers Strause will hit gold but Skyline just isn't it."
tt1564585,"Skyline was probably the worst piece of crap I've seen in a long time. Just when I thought it was finally over, it got even worse. Just picture a bad version of Independence Day, but instead of following the exciting people who will save the planet, you sit in a room with the most annoying people on Earth.I liked the concept with the Cloverfield feel without the camcorder shakiness. But you never get the feeling that you care what happens to these people. I found myself hoping they would all get killed. It was a lot like War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise, except not as good. And that was not a good movie. A movie about aliens destroying the entire world, and you spend it in one room for almost the whole film. Now this wouldn't be all bad if done right, except the actors are just props and the drama is empty and forced. I would recommend showing it to film students as an example of how to make an action movie boring."
tt1564585,"The movie is an entertaining ride for the most part as long as you go into the movie prepared for something that will have no unique characters or a decent script. - I saw the movie fully expecting a bad script, characters I wouldn't like, no artful directing, and a plot that fails to do anything new or interesting. But I allowed myself to be entertained by it as a simple piece of sci-fi/monster action! This is what you must do if you go to see it!!I was mostly inspired to do this review because I think the film doesn't deserve some of the really nasty 2/10 reviews I have seen. Basically the aliens and each confrontation against them are generally exciting and save the film. Considering the film was made on quite a small budget they did a great job with the effects. I think fans of video games like the RESISTANCE series or HALF LIFE should be able to enjoy it a bit more than most. A lot of people have been to harsh on this film, it is clear from the trailer this is just another alien invasion movie. Anyone who watches it expecting a modern sci-fi classic like District 9 will be disappointed - so don't do that. Basically if you are unsure about seeing the film but enjoy sci-fi/monster movies for nothing but quick entertainment you should get something out of it."
tt1564585,"Plain and simple... this is the worst sci-movie ever made and any half-wit would agree. There is absolutely no argument to support otherwise.After leaving the cinema, rather than reviewing the last 92 mins of our lives we'll never get back, my mate and I discussed how exactly movie's like this make it past the script-writing stage... It actually filled me with rage that people put millions of dollars into a project this idiotic and ultimately unrewarding in so many ways.If you want a spoiler, watch the trailer... that IS the movie. It shows the first 2 minutes of the movie... after that you're given no closure... the acting gets worse, the storyline repeats and thats it. blue lights, blue veins on faces, average looking aliens and a hovering spaceship.As matter of fact, i recommend seeing skyline, because you'll be able to tell people what 'the worst movie you're ever seen' is."
tt1564585,"I usually agree with IMDb ratings, but with this one I could not disagree more. 4.5???? Ridiculous. Yes, It's certainly not a masterpiece, and doesn't have an incredibly clever or elaborate script, however it has a lot of virtues that deserve a whole lot more than a poor 4.5: First the visual effects are really, really good. Second: the acting in my opinion was also very acceptable, very natural and according to the situation, the way normal humans would react to an extraordinary terrifying situation, an alien invasion; a few cliché dialog but nothing really to be annoyed for. Another plus is the end: incredibly bizarre and surprising, didn't see it coming. Finally and most important, it kept me interested all the way till the end, which is what a movie should do. Now, knowing that the budget for this movie was $10 million I honestly think the producers and the whole team did an excellent job. 7/10 seems a fair rating for me and I truly recommend it to sci-fi lovers despite the bad ratings."
tt1564585,"After reading so many negative reviews I was actually considering not going to watch it....I was expecting the worst I even took my android phone in case it was really bad and I could of played a couple of games.This film doesn't follow the Hollywood method it doesn't have a normal ending, characters are not printed on politically correct paper.I found the reactions of the people involved to be realistic, normal people with small minds and grasping to small problems in a situation they have no control over..A humankind shown to be 99.999% normal petty and none heroic.We watch so many films that follow a formula that show man out to be this amazing being who always survives always wins we are so use to being saved and its not really true is it ? We don't have a ace pilot or elitist hacker we don't have a superhero to fix it all, we be in trouble if something more advanced than us comes to play.To me this makes it an awesome film and strangely I found the rest of the people in the cinema of the same mind as soon as the film finished people I didn't know started discussing it as a bit of fresh air.If you like your films like independence day or Armageddon or any film where humankind are groomed and praised where a prayer to the gods or a speech by the president saves the day then you probably won't like this movie.I look forward to seeing skyline 2"
tt1564585,"Just saw an advance screening of this new sci-fi would be epic and although I won't give away too much of the plot (as wafer thin as it is)I will say the conclusion has shades of District 9, looks to be there for a Skyline part 2. After a gleaming light blankets over Los Angeles one random morning @430am, it lures people outside. Looking directly into the light causes a dire effect which is part of the problem. None of that is explained. Eric Balfour is a good looking leading man, pity his chiseled features out weigh his acting ability. However in his defence, the script sucks, I could write a better one over breakfast. The special effects are certainly effective for the most part. My favourite moments are when the bad boy aliens are on the attack against Stealth jets and the view from the rooftops are outstanding visuals. The trailer was certainly interesting and the film simply doesn't back up the premise. War of the worlds and Independence Day have had a baby, it's called SKYLINE. Worth a look, it's a good sci-fi curiosity and the female leads are all gorgeous which helps matters with such a soft screenplay."
tt3132450,"I've been watching a lot of movies lately from Thailand, Indonesia and India with very mixed results so going into my very first Malaysian film I was skeptical.A comedy zombie movie that mimics Shaun of the Dead this is a goofy but mildly entertaining little feature that gets quite a bit right. Much like the aforementioned film it see's a lovable loser and how he tackles the zombie apocalypse, except instead of comparable friend here our protagonist has children fighting by his side.With wacky dialogue, some good physical humor and a passable cast I have to say KL Zombie is some really watchable stuff. Where it gets it right is the humor, where it gets it wrong is some of the later writing which spoiled the film somewhat.So my disdain for children didn't help matters and our leading man walks a tightrope between funny and annoying, beyond them the other characters play very very small roles by comparison so it hinges on him and his schoolyard friends.I actually wanted to like the film more than I did, it looks great, some of the humor is certainly on point and I do love zombie comedies. Sadly some of the poor writing and weird decisions in the closing moments really didn't make a vast amount of sense.A solid enough watch for fans of zombie comedies, but don't expect something on the same level of some of the greats. Regardless for my first foray into Malaysian cinema I'm happy enough.The Good:Some funny momentsLooks the partThe Bad:Stock screamsThat random insistence these countries have to suddenly go English for a line here and thereCertain elements are really dumb"
tt3132450,"Theres nothing in here I wouldn't let a young teenager watch, which is a fail when it comes to any sort of horror in my book. The humour is crass and obvious, and fails because of that. It tries to fit in sub plots which add nothing and just over extend it. Bits were of interest - starting in a school for example - but not enough to make this really worth watching."
tt3132450,"I knew even before watching this was going to be a silly zombie flick, and I was not disappointed! KL Zombi is ridiculous and does what it wants to, but is entertaining at the same time. I loved watching the child actors in the background, where they could be seen being silly and having fun. I enjoyed the jabs at MLM marketing. I thought the characters were silly and definitely fit the role they were casted for. I think the only twist that I wish were a bit better hidden was the role the MLM products would have in the apocalypse! Definitely a fun watch for a rainy day, but a little silly for some audiences, maybe."
tt3132450,"Not your typical zombie movie, and not a good one either. It's a mix of Shaun of the Dead / Sherlock Holmes type of zombie action comedy but it's pretty bad. Is this suppose to be a spoof? I guess so or just chalk it up to a low budget movie that shouldn't have been made. Warning, spoiler but you're not going to watch this anyways. It's pretty obvious from the start how things will go down from start to finish, foreshadowing if you will. Byproduct of some miracle cream causes an outbreak and the miracle cream reverses the outbreak, sounds like Biohazard (resident evil). There's no consequences for anything that happens in this movie except the main character gets a girl at the end. Human to zombie back to human. no one dies even after being bitten and losing a large amount of blood and flesh. No one is affected after eating human flesh. All is good.The acting here is quite mediocre/bad. It's hard to identify with any of these character since they are all simpletons that don't take anything serious especially the main protagonist. So the main guy is an idiot and doesn't notice people turning, much like Shaun from Shaun of the dead. It's about 1/3 of the movie until he realize the situation and he goes around trying to save his peeps, much like Shaun. He uses his hockey stick which disappears and reappears between scenes. Before he fights zombies, he stands around and does some visualization of how he will defeat his enemy, much like Robert Downey Jr in Sherlock. Got boring quick. First act was okay. Some scenes were funny but nothing laugh out loud. Just a HAH... The build up was a little slow to the outbreak. The second act what just um..disappointing as the comedy slowly diminished to slapstick comedy and dumb choices made. The movie drags in the 3rd act which tries to be serious to wrap up. What else... Kids easily kills zombie with giant boulder supposed they could lift and throw or take them down with their bare hands. What?!?! No...Kids in movie is already a no no. Kids with strength of a tiger? The girl was a little stiff and the boy was a goof.The one redeeming qualities of the movie are the hot actresses and a couple of good dissing. Do not watch."
tt3132450,"Decent little zombie movie, with some good humor and a few twists."

tt3132450,"After a series of strange encounters, a group of friends finds themselves stuck in a rapidly-spreading zombie invasion throughout the city as more and more citizens succumb to the deadly virus, forcing a lazy slacker to pick up the pieces and help his friends get away from the creatures safely.This was a decent if problematic horror/comedy. One of the better elements here is the openly fun nature of the way the group gets the setup here to turn us onto them. Some of these scenes and counters turn out to be genuinely funny as the manner of sowing them to be a fun-loving, easy-going group that can hang out and joke with each other which creates the kind of easy-going connection to the group. Given that the majority of these scenes provide some fine comedic elements including the goofy characters, rapid-fire lines of dialog and just absurd situations that usually result from these kinds of efforts. That also makes for quite a light-hearted and silly which enables all the fun to come about. Even with the lighter approach, the zombie action here is quite fun. The numerous amount of encounters throughout here, from the zombies overrunning the school to the ambush at the cemetery as well as the various rescue attempts to grab the others out of hiding and take them to safely allow for a wholly enjoyable time here. The continuous amount of action is rather thrilling as there are plenty of encounters between the group and the creatures as they attempt to combat the overriding amount of creatures in the building which leads into the wholly original and somewhat creative manner of dealing with the creatures as this is perfectly in tune with the silliness of the rest of the film. Given that the zombies look quite impressive in their detail and manage to look quite impressive as well, there's a lot to really like with this one. Still, there are some problems with the film. The main issue is surprisingly the comedy, which is the true definition of hit-or-miss. The main aspect of driving the comedy in the film is people seemingly unaware they're interacting with the zombies, this requires most of the people here to be moronically stupid for failing to see the obvious and then causing them to get attacked as a result. This is compounded with a preponderance of the rapid-fire dialog, mugging for the camera or goofy accents even in their natural dialect creates the vast majority of the comedy elements here and it's light-hearted in tone to generate laughs in the proper mindset yet completely individualistic in execution. Beyond that, the light-hearted tone manages to really downplay a lot of the severity of the situation since the mandates involved in the filming mean a lot of what goes on in here isn't serious so there's no real damage to anything or anything as a result of this. However, it's not that bad overall and has a lot to like.Rated Unrated/PG-13: Violence and Language."
tt1241317,"An unfortunate missed opportunity. I didn't give this movie a 5 because it was different from the original, i thought it wasn't different enough. I have read the Death Note manga several times and i think that, for a Shonen Jump Manga, it is a Masterpiece.Still, being a Manga made for a very specific demographic it is tied to several silly Japanese teen archetypes. For example: Light Yagami being a High School Student and Misa Amane being a Teen idol, both of them being Japanese, that kind of thing. The Story of a NoteBook of Death that is used to ""create a better world"" however, has a potential that far exceeds the original manga. I believe that, had this been done correctly, it could have been on par with Breaking Bad. It could have been a master piece. They didn't even have to use the names of the original characters, they could have forgotten about the silly high school plot line and the Japanese clichés.It should have been a TV Series and the characters should have been Detectives. Its sad to see such missed potential. I honestly believe that, had this been done by good writers and on the right format, it could have far surpassed the original."
tt1241317,"I want to preface by saying that this movie was my introduction to Death Note, my friends were big fans of the original material so I knew what it was about but I never read the manga or watch the anime. I understand they are also not very interested in this film, anyway the movie just launched on Netflix so I watched it. I thought Adam Wingard overall did a good job, it's not a great movie by any means, but I thought it was well-directed and entertaining, even though it's also largely flawed. The biggest problem with this film might be the tonal changes and the pacing, the movie had trouble finding its voice and is trying to move to fast. There was moments of horror, followed by a quick comic relief and then serious conversations. Tonally, I have to admit it was a little bit all over the place. The performance by Nat Wolff was uneven for me, part of it was great, for example, no spoilers, but there's a scene with his father at the beginning where I thought he was nailing it, but I'm not sure I was into all the screaming and over-the-top reactions, which goes back to the problem with the tone of the film. The script is also messy and might be the sole reason why this movie did not exactly land. Regarding Ryuk, Willem Dafoe did a nice job voicing him, but I guess I was hoping to get more of his flavor into the character, the effects on Ryuk looked great in the shadows, but sometimes he's sitting on a bed clearly and you can notice some imperfections, but that might only be me because he was definitely a strong part of this adaptation. I'm curious what the fans of the original thought of Ryuk in this movie, because I get the feeling that overall most of them might be disappointed. Yes the script is problematic but, Wingard knows how to direct a movie, loved the visuals, the soundtrack, it was interesting and I slightly enjoyed it. 6/10"
tt1241317,"Disclaimer: it is pretty obvious that the anime is far better than this movie. It is arguably one of the best animes/mangas ever written. But this movie isn't actually as bad as many people make it out to be either. So just keep that in mind.Once you realize that this movie was supposed to be a different take on the whole Death Note story it is actually quite enjoyable. Yes, many of the characters from the anime are missing in the movie. But that was to be expected. It would've been impossible to incorporate all of them into a movie of this length.I think that all the die-hard Death Note fanatics need to suspend their disbelief and just accept that this movie wasn't intended for them. None of these live action movies are. I have seen dozens of them and every single time people complain that it wasn't canon or too simplified. As if it's actually possible to comprise an entire series into a movie. Give me a break.About the cast; some of the performances were really solid. L's acting e.g.. I can see how some people complained about the ""whitewashing"" but I think that they just don't get it. There is already a Japanese live action movie about this anime with an all- Asian cast. This is supposed to be a more Western approach to the story hence the white cast. I think people need to respect the vision of the director on this one."
tt1241317,"As a fan of the original Death Note anime I am very disappointed in this film. It was poorly acted, horribly paced, and the drama felt more edgy than composed. The characters personalities were completely changed to the point where I didn't see why they even bothered maintaining the original names and The events of the story were changed so drastically I forgot that I was watching Death Note. In the original anime both L and Light were very calm and rational in how they made each decision, creating a suspenseful psychological drama, but in the film both of them do things that were very out of character and essentially made no sense. Overall this felt very rushed and poorly directed, I wouldn't be surprised if the director had never even heard of the original anime before doing this film."
tt1241317,"I have never felt compelled to write any reviews but I felt that I needed to say something for this movie.I normally like Netflix TV shows but movies lately have been really sub- par with this one being the worst I've seen from them.This is a total waste of time and this movie should have never been made, it's an insult to the original Death Note (Desu Nōto). The plot was totally ruined since it was changed from the original, yeah they kept the premise but they decided it was a good idea to mix it up with stupid teen drama/relationship and a bunch of other nonsensical BS.Go watch Desu Nōto instead if you haven't or if you have then watch it again!"
tt1241317,"First time ever writing a review here. Had to do it now because I don't want people like me who enjoyed the original anime/manga to waste their time on this movie. Firstly i didn't know this was a movie until it was released on Netflix. I'm not going into detail, but there is a reason its a long manga/anime and not a movie.Anyway, the protagonist isn't interesting, L is not interesting and the plot is garbage. They took all the good thing from the original and butchered it and made another bad American adaptation.Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed.Save yourself the misery and never watch this."
tt1241317,"I really enjoyed this movie, having never seen nor heard about the Japanese manga it's based on, I can't compare this movie to it, therefore as a supernatural thriller, it's not a horror movie to me, it was very entertaining, something very different and it kept my interest throughout. The ending was unfinished to me, therefore leaving a window open for a sequel. I'm hoping there will be a part two, I'm intrigued. However seeing the number of negative reviews that might not happen, most negative reviews are from people who have seen the Japanese manga. I say give it a try, check it out, you should be entertained."
tt1241317,"I don't even know where to begin with this, it is rare that an anime adaptation ever turns out to be good, so I didn't go into this movie with high expectations. Having seen the anime twice now I was completely underwhelmed and disappointed throughout the whole movie. The characters in this movie had little to no similarities to their originals. There's honestly way too many things for me to say about this that I simply just don't have the time to do so. I tried to watch this movie as it's own thing and not compare it to the original but that was basically impossible for me. If you're a fan of the anime and manga, honestly don't even watch this, it's not worth your time."
tt1241317,"I had no idea this was based on anything. Sure, I know Akira, Ghost In The Shell, Hellsing, Battle Royale and maybe a few others, but that's about the extent of my manga/anime knowledge. And as popular as manga/anime has become in the West, it is still a niche genre. Them's the facts.If those superfans are able to step back out of their extreme partisanship, they would find a slick, competently produced, directed, shot and acted piece of cinema. Production values are quite high overall and the acting, while far from Shawshank, is also not abysmal by any means.Trust me, I have seen a lot of abysmal acting in films.Willem DaFoe's voiceover was terrific and I personally found the character of ""L"" pretty interesting.All the 1 ratings are completely out of place for this film if one solely judges it as a standalone piece of cinema. And of course with a healthy does of suspension of disbelief, which given the actual source material is a complete must anyway. It can be argued that the MCU (and the DCU for that matter) has done much the same thing with their adaptations so what's the huge problem here?Rather, a 5-7 star rating for this film as a standalone film would be far more appropriate. Honestly."
tt1241317,"The original Death Note was a masterpiece, some of the legitimately smartest most well written television of all time so all these years later hearing it was getting the American treatment I was understandably concerned.Sadly my fears were confirmed, all of them. It's as if the creators were given a 30 second explanation of Death Note and based a movie on what they were told.The characters are simply nothing like the originals, the plot is a compacted mess, this simply isn't Death Note.Light has gone from an arrogant, smart, cool calm and collected person to a weak screaming baby.L has gone from a savant secretive quirky quiet child to an out in the open gun wielding threat spewing idiot.Misa has become Mia and no longer a ditsy blonde bimbo but now a devious manipulative brunette.The original plot? Forget about it, straight out the window and something that misses the point of the story altogether in to replace it.I could rant about what an embarrassment this is for ages, I think I could quite frankly write a book on how much of a slap in the face to the fans this is but I'll resist.But make no mistake, that's exactly what this is.The Good:Willem Defoe as RyukThe Bad:An offensive cluster crap to fans of the originalLight Turner........really!?Terrible representation of LightTerrible representation of LTerrible representation of Mia/MisaMisa becomes Mia.....really!?So........many..........changes to the rules of the Death Note!So........many..........changes to the plotThe soundtrack during the big wheel scene.......really!?"
tt1241317,"First off, I have not read the original source material manga for this. Right off the bat, I realize this will infuriate people, as the vast majority of comments on here destroy this movie because of the heavy deviation from the manga. I get that, I typically enjoy a book far more than the film adaptation. However, this review is strictly about the merits of the movie, not how it stands up against the original. Knowing nothing of the manga, I really enjoyed this movie. The concept was unfamiliar to me, and I found the characters and plot interesting. I realize if I ever read the source material (which I may, as I enjoyed this so much), I might join the chorus of angry voices who think the movie should have followed the source more closely. Today, having just watched the movie, I liked it a lot. Again, I get why people who are fans of the original are hating on this so much. Those of us who actually grew up reading ""Iron Man"" hated the slaughter that was Iron Man 3 (seriously, that is what you are going to do with The Mandarin, arguably Iron Man's most ruthless and deadly enemy?), but the rest of the world, who had no clue about the original comics loved it. So, maybe this is my ""Iron Man 3."" But ignorance is bliss, so I enjoyed Death Note a lot."
tt1241317,"First of all, it's not like the original. At all, really. I felt like with a rewrite, it'd have made more sense to just make it an original story with new characters and names that was set in the Death Note universe. That being said, it is not a legitimate criticism to say it's not like the original. Changing things is fine. Making the story completely different is fine. The question is if it thematically suits the original, and if what was changed works.Well, I think it does. Mostly. It has a lot of the same themes of the original, even if the characters were mostly completely different. It questions the morality of murdering bad people without trial, and demonstrates the fanaticism that can arise with power. The film overall seems to be presented stylistically, moodily, with some nice musical interludes in a Donnie Darko sort of vein. It has a few twists and a pretty nice ending that makes it relatively satisfying, and it doesn't follow a predictable Hollywood format, which makes it at least a bit refreshing. And if you don't believe me that it's thematically similar to the original, the original author and artist of Death Note both praised the film believing it was a good adaption thematically.There were things wrong with it. The pacing wasn't great. It starts off well and then it just shoots off like a rocket, making it hard to follow the second act. It made a pretty big directing faux pas by introducing new characters and concepts right inside a montage. A lot of the dialogue isn't written so well, making characters occasionally sound banal. The Final Destination-esque Rube Goldberg deaths were often overly done and comically gratuitous. I don't think it fits the themes very well to literally laugh when someone gratuitously explodes. You don't need to make huge stretches to be hardcore just because you're on Netflix, guys.Overall I think this is not a film for the fanboys. They're going to hate it because it's different. I feel like I like it mostly because to be honest with you. However, honestly? I found the original to be flawed too. I think it will be an interesting but flawed film for pretty much anyone who doesn't worship the original. It is aesthetically (except for the utterly gratuitous deaths) and thematically pleasing, but has some pacing and writing issues. Hope this review will be helpful."
tt1241317,"This movie was a mess. From a directional standpoint, to acting, to script writing, everything. The VFX is horrible in this movie. It's so low budget, you'd imagine it be a cheap TV show. Ryuk's forehead is too big and feels nonexistent within the mise-en-scene. Light Yagami is everything wrong, changed to a bullied kid to feel politically relevant and correct. He's just eccentric, over the top, and a creepy looking mofo. Mia is supposed to be Misa? She is changed to a typical short girl cheerleader who follows Light around. Also, why would anyone name their kid Light in America is beyond me. This movie was rushed. From the start, we already see the book falling down. There is no build up to this or tension, it just falls and it's one of the cheapest looking movie production props I have ever seen. The design is something you'd see from a fanmade film. Then, the title sequence. They got the colors right at first, but then they went with complete blue, when it should be red and a bit of purple. All of the dialogue is awkward and choppy. Terrible line deliveries from each actor, just overcooked and several mumbling moments. The deaths were immoral, stupid, and just goes to Final Destination B-movie horror territory. The writers they hired wrote Immortal, a terrible movie with Henry Cavill. So, it was doomed to suck to begin with. They hired Adam Wingard too who directed the overrated The Guest. He's just bad, they should stop hiring him. His camera tricks are cheap, choppy, and horrible to look at. Blair Witch was unwatchable, this one is almost too. Ugliest looking cinematography of the year, muddy, unsmooth, bad shot composition, and student film level. The music choice is pop/techno like music and it is all wrong. Death Note was Gothic, operatic, and heavy metal. The only thing they got right was Ryuk's voice.2/10."
tt1241317,"I'm often on the defending party for films. I notice that many reviewers seem to complain much about any movie is released. That was the case with Alien: covenant, for example. That movie was far superior to this one. Prior to the film, I watched in about three days the entire Death Note series. Because I really just got into it and don't plan on watching the anime again soon, I don't consider myself a fan (never watched animes before, by the way), but I reckon it was a very clever series. At times it had its cheesiness, but still worked pretty well. When the source material is well written, I don't think that departing from it is the right choice. The Martian proved that, for instance. Changching the plot should be always for the benefit of it, and not to overly simplify the story and to take out some of it core aspects.Death Note's film adaptation chose this second route. I have the feeling that they didn't understand at all what was the series about. The anime mostly focused on L and Light's intellectual fight, battles of tricks and making one and another be unsure about what his intentions are. Ryuk (who I thought would be a practical effect and not CGI, as instead it sadly proved to be) had more importance. Truth is, this movie had also a very low runtime in order to cover up the plot well, it might have needed an extra 40 minutes (so a 2h 30m film), but it would have needed an entirely different plot.Instead, when the movie finished, it turned out to be just a rushed sequence of events, most of which seemed incoherent if seen next to the anime, which was a very clever story. Ultimately, the film settles for a needless and overly bloody gore feast. The speed of this film is so fast paced that, by when I arrived to the 1 hour mark, I could not believe that we had forty minutes left. And I came to realise that nothing that happened felt relevant to the whole storyline. Death note should have been adapted in a slightly slower paced film, and had minimal gore (most of people died by heart attack). That wouldn't mean that it had to be necessarily a boring film, or a non-R rated one. The themes of moral ambiguity and killing powers make it anyways a very dark story to tell.The only positive note I could find in all of this is that sometimes both L and Light's actor delivered scenes which made me suggest that they where up to the roles, if the original anime was to be followed. L sometimes used the anime character's same line delivery, Light seemed capable of behaving as a bloodthirsty, dark and evil character. Sadly, the movie didn't allow the actors to perform their characters rightfully. Williem Dafoe's voice sounded exactly like the original Ryuk's. That said, Ryuk appeared for about 4 minutes, so there wasn't much there.Ultimately, this is the perfect example on how an adaptation of a good source material can simply suck. I recall only Eragon being such an unfaithful, unrightful and almost offensive adaptation to a very clever and deep story."
tt1241317,"I don't suggest you watch the movie if you are a huge fan of Death Note, because it will ruin the whole thing. The actors and actresses were terrible and just everything was a big disappointment. The movie had almost nothing to do with the anime. If you have never heard of Death Note before, watch the anime first and if you are curious to watch the movie, go ahead..But as I said before, you will be disappointed."
tt1241317,"If you liked the Death Note anime or live action series, you will not like this.If you didn't like the Death Note anime or live action series, then there's a good chance you may like this.Death Note is not meant to be turned into a movie, as the Japanese movies prove."
tt1241317,"I've been around a fair few dacades and watched a lot of movies - among them horror, dark fantasy, and so on. Not sure why this one has so many negative reviews - possibly based on the original anime (which I admittedly have never watched).Even so, I went in with an open mind and zero expectations and I really enjoyed it. The acting was sound, as was the the story, effects, continuity and so on. Yes there were a few times when I spotted a minor error but so what? It was entertaining and enjoyable, without too much gratuitous gore.If you have nothing else to watch and need something to do with an hour and a bit, I'd recommend Death Note."
tt1241317,"This is probably the worst TV to Movie adaptation out there, and I watched the Last Airbender. Tried too hard to be edgy and just turned into a Final Destination rip off with bad effects, choppy editing and a death god who looked more like a burn victim. The Charatizarion and motives were all awful and completely wrong and the stupid twists were cheap and predictable. Just do not waste your time."
tt1241317,"I've came into this film having never read the source material and it has made me want to read it. I agree that bad adaptions of things we love can make us hate films/series, so I'm kind glad I didn't read the source material before watching this as I really enjoyed the story and the idea of it. I thought the actors were all decent and loved Ryuk! I am gutted the film flopped so there won't be any chance of a sequel, but I am glad to have been introduced to it and will definitely purchase the graphic novels, once I've done so I might even come back here and change this review to a 1 and agree with all the hatred that it has been given."
tt1241317,"Interesting and kept me watching it throughout.
I found it a unique storyline and it is worth a watch."
tt1241317,"I understand that movies can have different plots and endings than the original anime/book but this one stripped the entire essence of what was so great about Death Note.The characters are not at all how they are in the series. Light was a stud, smart a sociopath genius who could manipulate and outsmart anyone with and unwaiverable goal to be God. L is almost autistic and incredibly smart, not emotional. He was logical and to the point. Mia is a groupie fan girl with Light, a celebrity on her own but never would try to kill unless ordered by Kira to carry out his true goal of being God for as long as possible and destroying everything in his way.The scene were Ryuk appears makes me want to puke it is so bad, his relationship with Light is far from what we see in the series, the plot is plain stupid. IT is mostly about him and his gf fighting whether they took it too far him and him being dumb enough to know his gf didn't take the book and kill some cops. I hate this movie so much and so mad I spent whatever time I spent watching it because it is not worth even 5 minutes. Whoever made this should be ashamed and never produce a movie again."
tt3422462,"Critic Turned Writer-Director Karan Anshuman's 'Bangistan' is a Good Idea, but the execution is average. Made with noble intentions, this satirical comedy, however, doesn't leave the impact it ought to have, due to not-so-strong writing. 'Bangistan' Synopsis: After being brainwashed by two extremists, an Indian & a Muslim, turn into suicide bombers & plan to execute a dangerous plan at a cultural event in Poland. But their ideologies change, as they learn the truth about religion & god.'Bangistan' lacks sharp writing. The Screenplay by Anshuman, Puneet Krishna & Sumit Purohit, definitely is noble, but it isn't engaging enough. The protagonists are decently written, but their journey doesn't inspire much. There are some moments that work, but overall, the narrative isn't full-proof. Anshuman's Direction is amateurish. Cinematography captures the beautiful locales of Poland, nicely. Editing lacks sharpness. Ram Sampath's Score is good.Performance-Wise Riteish Deshmukh is marvelous & the life of the show. He is sincere, affecting & absolutely believable in his portrayal of a man torn between racial discrimination & violence. Pulkit Samrat is over-the-top. Jacqueline Fernandez is wasted in a cameo, she looks great though. Kumud Mishra is excellent in dual roles. Chandan Roy Sanyal & Aarya Babbar don't work.On the whole, 'Bangistan' is a half-baked fare."
tt3422462,"By the promos, one expects a hilarious laugh riot which sounded amazing, extremely novel and different. But what the film offers is a big let-down. The film runs with a snail's pace. The director is unclear whether he wants to deliver his message through humour and satire or moralizing lecturing.Initially Bangistan promises a bang and showers hints of satire in almost every scene, dialogue and frame; but runs out of impressive ideas and additions soon after the successful take-off. In this supposedly comedy film, there are just handful of moments that bring a smile on your face and most of the time, you just stare in horror at the pointless stuff happening in front of you. The film's music somehow is a relief.Riteish Deshmukh was the eye among the blind. Though he was confused most of the times. Pulkit Samrat was the epitome of over-acting. Jacqueline Fernandez's role was a mere blink & miss in 3-4 scenes & 1 song. She was not required at all & was used as a prop. Aarya Babbar was funny in 1 or 2 scenes. The performances of rest were unsound.The problem with ‪‎Bangistan‬ is that it tries to be too many things at the same time. The film's promos promise a comedy however, the jokes soon start falling flat one after the other. Then the director suddenly decides to make a preachy film with a social message on religious harmony. It's ultimate undoing lies in its desperate lunge towards delivering a message in the climax (which was the saving grace)."
tt3422462,Another lame Bollywood attempt to support the arbitrarily coined notion of Hindu terror. The motivation for the plot for why any Hindu would go to Poland to blast a human bomb is ridiculously weak.
tt3422462,"One expects quality cinema from a guy who is a former film critic and who has a strong production backing, but after sitting through this piece of junk, I want to revisit the idea that film critics make good filmmakers.Poking fun at popular international brands, ideologies, and stereotypes is what the film relies heavily on for humor from the beginning. That a fictitious country called Bangistan is torn between communal tension is a good base to make a satire. But the wagon which was supposed to hit the star looks like it has punctured all its tires, burst all its windows and windshield, and has swerved off road into a known yet unpleasant territory that is best described as moronic and highfalutin. Known, because this territory is already crowded with the Bollywood likes (Roy (2015), et al). Unpleasant, because, well, you know.Two over-smart and over-sympathetic characters (Samrat & Deshmukh) are sent by their respective community leaders to Poland (for heck's sake) of Hindi speaking yet Polish lipping inhabitants to carry out a suicide bombing mission in an attempt to instigate international terror thereby disrupting harmony. Dialogs have been stolen from classic films, and if you were to subtract the steal from the total dialogs in the film, you will have a non-operational womb in your hand.The biggest problem with the film is that its comedy is all single- layered, meaning a joke is introduced and is taken forward until it transforms into farce (and travesty) and into hogwash and then finally spirals into an abyss of dark nothingness. Editing and direction are in gutters, and so is the pretentious screenplay. Basically, the whole film is Mr Anshuman's imagination, and when one imagines things, success is always a presumed by-product. Unfortunately, nothing works in reality; not even those indigenously made explosives that they use in the film. The songs ignite trepidation in its viewers and the music man is growling his way to get noticed. We get it, Mr Sampat, you can scream.There is not an iota of sense in the film which could grip the audience, forget about hooking them. There is no insight into the actual theme of the film and with that sermon at the end, all goes downhill. The protagonists or the antagonists or the anti-heroes (it's all messed up) suddenly stop and introspect about their foolish actions and then we have a genre shift in the film, which is more unbearable than what preceded.While Deshmukh looks confused, Samrat is the epitome of overacting. I checked my phone for three seconds and my neighbor notified me that I had missed Miss Fernandez. I was happier.The plot holes are in millions, plus during a fight scene towards the end, all limits are crossed and one realizes that these two hours will never come back. The background score tries hard like a mother tries hard to teach her son to carve out a perfect cursive letter ""f,"" but the result is a garbled product which looks like a pile of crap. And the whole drama ends with tears. Trust me, there will be tears. River of tears in the situation room of Excel Entertainment. For cryin' out loud, the expectations were higher because of Akhtar and Sidhwani on board, however the man at the wheel goes super retard.When a rookie filmmaker uses Mozart's ""The Marriage of Figaro"" to weigh in the magnitude of a scene, one ought to know that there is nothing much to consider in the film. In the case of Bangistan, why don't you skip the word ""much"" from the previous statement? Ironically, to imagine that if the director was to again don the cap of a film critic one last time and review his own movie, the river of tears that I was talking about would turn into an ocean, all thanks to Mr Anshuman.BOTTOM LINE: Bangistan can be best described in three Us - unimaginative, unfunny, and ugly.VERDICT: No stars. Skip for life.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"
tt3422462,The real terrorist are who made this film and muck with people's belief and prejudice and generalization all true believers
tt3422462,"It feels bad to see such good movies not getting their due, I watched this movie very late from its release but I am happy that I did. From the day I saw promos of this movie, I so badly wanted to see this. The imagination and art direction of this movie is amazing, something really really innovative and new. The whole concept, cinematography, costumes, dialogues, locations and acting, everything is commendable. I accept this movie may not be funny as those brainless Bollywood comedies rather it is more subtle with genuine smile on your face throughout the movie. As I watched this I didn't feel bore for even a second. I wanted this movie to go on and on, there are several small small yet thought provoking lines that shows the brilliance of the writer. I would recommend this movie to any movie lover, watch it for its simplicity, sensibility, and subtle comedy. You wont come out laughing but surely thinking and smiling :)"
tt3422462,"Director does not know his craft for sure. There is not a single scene where you can appreciate his work, rather he drags scenes so it comes as slap than slapstick. Writers had a good idea but execution and development are really not worthy. Like teli shopping style of arms showcasing could have been funny but due to exaggeration is comes flat then turns into irritation. This film is full of exaggeration, rather use of Saffron or Green color or the parallel cuts. First of all, main plot of interchanging religion is totally illogical. When every religion is sending there representative in a religious world conference, which is ridiculously without any security protection, according to makers, then why did their master send their respective person with religion change!? Selected person are so stupid that even being on a bomb planting mission they agree to almost share a duplex type of flat which has unbelievably hole in the roof. Creative team are like aliens, who does not know the basic possibility because they are not ready to find some interesting things so they always take the most convenient childish solution for everything. They insert scene where pigeon carries a letter. Which era they belong to!? Motel owner clearly mentioned that no animal is allowed but person takes that animal for a walk!? Why would any stranger go to other person flat to keep the animal because their society does not allow it!? The Poland Police is so naïve that they can't find anything suspicious and searches in idiotic way. I am unable to understand that why such type of country give makers subsidy to show them stupid. Pre climax is most irritating and climax is above all frustrating. Performance wise Ritesh Deshmukh is miscast. He is an undoubtly a good actor and deserves better script. Pulkit Samrat is perfectly fit, as his unbalanced acting perfectly fits this flick. One thing is sure, you can't stop yourself laughing when he cries. Chandan Roy Sanyal, Akash Dabhade, Kumud Mishra are good actors but without scope. Music by Ram Sampat is good. Lyrics by Puneet Krishna, are heavy but fit in the film."
tt3422462,"Enjoyed the movie, it has good mix of sarcastic humor and parellel drawn.Definitely deserves more credit than I see right now."
tt3422462,The movie has excellent story and excellent theme. Actors performed very well for this movie. Songs are simply superb. I don't watch Indian movies without skipping unnecessary parts. But this movie was fully entertaining and you do not need to skip anything. I don't know why other reviewers didn't like it. But whatever they said is not true. They might be saying because of religion/race. You could not ask for better entertaining movie. There should be more movies like this that explain the concept of humanity with a sense of humor and without insulting or disrespecting any one race. I agree with the user http://www.imdb.com/user/ur18203698/ . This movie is one of the finest movies I have seen in a long time.
tt3422462,"As an idea it really feels exciting to assume a film about two amateurish suicide bombers from a fictitious (Indian) land, planning to sabotage a World Peace Conference held in Poland. And the excitement increases further when in this comic plot, the Hindu bomber poses as a Muslim and the Muslim one portrays himself as a Hindu, trying to fool the authorities and participants together. However as experienced many times before, the plot that looks like a killer one on the paper doesn't turn out to be anything even close to average or fairly enjoyable when transformed into a film unfortunately.Beginning on a positive note, revealing the hidden secret behind every communal riot happening in the city, BANGISTAN commences as a political satire with all Indian characters in the script, but then slowly gets into the mold of a western comedy, unable to make any kind of substantial impact on the viewer due to more than one reason. Apart from all (unexpectedly) over the top performances, it has many weird sequences like a hotel room (in Poland) with a big hole in the roof connecting it with the upper floor, a goat brought in the same hotel for Eid without the owner's permission, an over- clever Hindi speaking taxi driver being the informer, the two Russian/Chinese eccentric bomb suppliers with their hidden laboratories and the two foreign police officers behaving like fools. The dialogues that ought to be the backbone of such message oriented satires, have been written pretty casually with only few enjoyable lines coming after long gaps.Having a decent opening 15 minutes, the pointless script keeps progressing with all forced, supposed to be funny moments post interval too. And then it eventually comes to an end with a long, preachy unimpressive climax that is unable to convey any kind of social message of 'One Religion' to the viewers. In short, though director Karan Anshuman might have had all good intentions to make an entertaining comedy with a message of World peace, the film fails to deliver the same and disappoints badly. In other words, following a western pattern of satirical comedy featuring all Indian characters, BANGISTAN keeps hanging in between and remains far away from impactful attempts such as the recent FILMISTAAN and more.In the performances, Ritesh Deshmukh tries his best but also looks like uninterested and unconvinced with the content throughout its two hours of duration. On the other hand, Pulkit Samrat puts in much more energy than required going over the top and so do the actors in the supporting cast, particularly the hamming Arya Babbar. Moreover its really confusing to see Jacqueline in such a poor role of a local waitress doing simply nothing in the film other than providing the glamour.Summing up, BANGISTAN has a poor direction, below average soundtrack but a better cinematography that unsuccessfully tries to give a significant message of 'One Religion of the World' to its audience. However mentioning its only merit, there is a thoughtful song coming towards the end with the lyrics,""Mujhko Kuchh Bhi Pata Nahin Tha, Waqt Bada Hi Achha Tha, Mera Koi Dharam Nahin Tha, Jab Main Chhota Bacha Tha"""
tt3422462,"Bangistan has a good concept at its core but falls flat on its face when it comes to execution. The movie's plot revolves around these two characters who are highly religious and are manipulated by their religious leaders to commit an act of terrorism. The way in which this is done makes absolutely no sense and is done purely for comedic reasons. The ""comedic"" scenes come of as cliché and doesn't feel organic rather it depends on weak dialogue and racist jokes. The chemistry between the characters works well enough although the performances are at best mediocre. Overall this movie comes of as a fairly predictable and fails to present anything new in terms of comedy. Had it been of a different genre altogether It would have been more interesting and original. It instead makes you think of what could have been."
tt3422462,"Knew this movie from @iamsrk tweet in reply to @FarOutAkhtar. It has Riteish Desmukh (which is comedy guarantee).The idea was a bit weak, but they tried to make it less controversy. Maybe for some people its a good movie, but I'd be not. This movie has a good message (though I got the message long time ago) in terms of peace. But it also emphasizing one's religion to others, maybe Oh My God! told us better, but let's give the credit to Hafeez bin Ali, Praveen Chaturvedi, Imam and the Pandit-ji whom use iPad.Music a bit catchy. Hogi Kranti delivers some unique things to viewers (at least me) then credit tittle song can't be skipped though.Jacqueline Fernandez as special appearance did good, but not really help the case which Hafeez and Praveen has been through. Direction itself is a bit unstable, and the story itself should be developed into something funnier, mightier and so on.In short, Bangistan is a cheerful trying to make us laugh (yes it did, Riteish did well) and delivered mediocre message to us."
tt3422462,"At this point in the Hindi film industry, when it has become so easy to follow a convention and earn a few million, it's refreshingly stimulating to watch a movie that is not only formula-free and original but also is brilliantly made. Its clever cinematography, witty, dry humour (every scene packed with it) and inspiration-driven plot (just shy of being preachy or cloying) make the film a much-needed breath of fresh air. And every breath is, of course, laced with laughter thanks to the satirical approach to serious topics, with a sharp lack of insensitivity. Heavy irony, cheeky puns, and visual humour are only a few of the myriad devices employed with such skill that the only real let-down of the movie becomes its cringe-worthily, predictable end (that I shall very carefully not reveal)- which is the reason I scored this work of near-genius an 8 instead of a greater rank."
tt3422462,"Reading the other reviews all I can think is that I went to see a different movie as I thought Bangistan was excellent from start to finish.I thought it was thoroughly entertaining and carried with it many wonderful messages – and many of those messages are ones that the world desperately needs to heed at this moment in time. Yes they may have been made in a fun, roundabout way, but hey – they're still important messages.I felt the premise of the story was an interesting one, that raised all sorts of crucial points, and that the build up to what was a great ending was woven superbly with all sorts of minor issues to deal with along the way such as lambs for Eid, alcohol, a love interest (or sorts), the funeral/immolation scene, and the way that each of the major characters had interpreted each others holy book.I watched it in a cinema full of Pakistanis and heard many of them laugh out loud in a nice way – which was great to hear, as with this kind of film it is only too easy to offend or to shy away from offending – it is a fine line.Maybe that was because a lot of them were probably expecting it to be an out- and-out Muslim-bashing film (with a title like Bangistan, who didn't?), and the fact that it was a very fair movie with a positive message to all religions made them let their hair down a bit and enjoy it.I really don't know what people were expecting from this movie as some of the reviews are so off the mark that I'd question their motives, and in some cases I'd question whether whoever wrote them has actually seen the movie.Seriously, I worry that so many people have been negative about a film that has such a positive message for one and all. If there were more movies like this - movies that highlight the futility and silliness of hatred - the world would be a far nicer place.And the video as the titles rolled was terrific, as was lots of the music throughout.I wouldn't be surprised if this is one of those slow burners. Once all the negative people have got their personal moans out of the way other people will start to see the movie for what it is - a well made satire on the current woes of the world.Peace :-)"
tt3422462,"Finally an Unbiased Movie, where there is no bashing, no crazy self obsessed Godmens, no sense less jokes, no Angst..... What does it have then? Pure Comedy: you'll literally keep laughing the whole time that to comfortably with Family around, this is movie is nice example where Comedy Movies can be done without Using Explicit Language, Sex Jokes, Booze & Dope References...it's Such a rarity now a days Nice Message: Lack of Understanding about each other is keeping everyone apart, Education this days should really teach each other about the Cultures & Values of each Religion... all Extremists are infatuated & Caught up in wrong understandings & using wrong logic for there own cause, some how Spiritual Values are been lost & only Rituals are left... And all this put forth in Happy Go Lucky Mood, Really good Acting & Direction........it's a nice Breather between all routine cliché movies... A total Entertainer & Paisa Wasool.... I Wonder Why Movies with such Nice Message & Feel Good nature is Banned in Pakistan, UAE...."
tt3422462,Why we are fighting for? Who is pushing us? Why we feel threatened from another group of people & the same they feel for us. If one or another group dies it's not a death or victory of one group over the other. It's a kind of embarrassment of humanity which died in the vicious cycle of thought developed by people who hates each other & can't make this world a better place. So blind faith in any belief can lead to disaster & this movie is eye opener for all of us.
tt3422462,"Movie quality etc is poor...there is humour but from What I have seen they tried to deliver a good message to the world. Why do I give it 9 stars? Because they did make fun of some things. But the reality is that people are really made sensitive about religions. I saw a review where someone mentioned that why ""a Hindu will go to Poland to do blast"". And what I see is that they really didn't understand the movie.The movie simply shows how politicians and leaders manipulate people to go against each other. And brainwash them to do really horrible things to others.I really appreciated this massage. So kindly if you are a professional critic or review person please go for the main backbone of the movie or story. Please do not give negative ratings because It's mentions things that you don't like. And for people who haven't seen it. Please watch it once for yourself before believing in any reviews."
tt3422462,"It shows the intensions of the 2 different religion and their love to their own religion in initial which finally comes to humanity at the end. The way they taught is remarkable, its overall family movie with lots of jokes and tease. The main cast choose was perfect but can be better for side casts. Overall it shows us perfectly about the religion war which we usually did in our daily life and can turns to such huge impact to others. I loved the song, ""Sab kahe marne se jannat, meri jang hai jeene ki"". I must recommend this movie to all youngsters, it might give a good funny moment or a different perspective ahead."
tt3422462,I don't understand why people have given low ratings. We can not expect every movie to be like KGF chapter 2 . It is a good film which you can watch once and enjoy it . Good commedy and good story.
tt5339586,"L. Frazier. Whoever the hell you are, please NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER attempt directing anything again"
tt5339586,"I consider myself easily amused. I truly respond to all sorts of humor. From clean comedians like Jim Gaffigan or Brian Reagan, to some really dark and dirty humor from Anthony Jeselnik or Jim Norton. I love it all.But this was bad. The jokes were mediocre at best, but what really ruined it for me is Mike constantly laughing his ass off to his own jokes. I'm not an expert, but I'm pretty sure it's a bad sign if you laugh harder than the audience to your own jokes. He looked like he was drunk or drugged. Or both. I lasted for about 30 minutes and I quit.If you want similar comedy specials on Netflix, but much better, try with Richard Pryor or Katt Williams."
tt5339586,Boy was this bad. I could not see past the first 13 minutes. Just Mike walking side to side laughing at his own jokes.
tt5339586,Hands down......the worst stand up show I have ever seen. I had high expectations and boy was I disappointed. Avoid this movie at all cost!!
tt5339586,I guess he have done some decent shows before since they put it on Netflix. But he have to put more work into the writing than this.Tom Segura and Bill Burr is another world from this guy.Text me if you need some good jokes with a punchline:.)
tt5339586,"I kept waiting for his performance to get better. It never did.Where he lost me forever was his advocating for dog fighting!!!! WTAF??!?!To my knowledge he has never apologized or walked back his stance on the most reprehensible crime against animals. He should never be allowed near a microphone again. SHAME ON MIKE EPPS!!! He is one of the worst people on the planet!He tried to say that dog fighting is the unofficial sport of the Midwest. Anyone who engages in this horrible practice should maroon themselves alone on a deserted sandbar forever.I hope he finally gets cancelled, because he deserves it.Don't waste your time watching this ""special."" It is anything but. My time would have been better spent by watching grass grow. It would have been infinitely more entertaining and certainly less upsetting.#MikeEppsDogFight #MikeEppsHorrible #MikeEppsLoser #CancelMikeEpps."
tt2392179,"Terribly cheesy voice-acting, cliché villain, horribly written characters, and humor that relies on fart jokes all combine to make this lame show.Honestly I don't understand that love for this whatsoever and the fact that someone here actually compared it to a masterpiece such as Courage the Cowardly Dog is ridiculous.Everything apart from the animation is terrible in this show.It's basically the Sonic Boom for Disney, relying on crap humor, a cliché terribly written plot, and flat characters that they constantly try to add depth to but honestly the characters are irredeemable. The show pretty much relies solely on the edgy teenager cliché for the characters.Basically everything that's been done in this show was done about 10 years ago but was done far better back then."
tt2392179,"I love this show for the clean animation and Erin Matthews' performance as PAC-MAN is amazing. Also, the stories are well written. The Ghost Gang (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde) are my favorite characters. Betrayus is also a lot of fun. Pinky and Pac-Man are one of the best couples. The only things I didn't like were two: First, Cylindria and Spiral. They are torture to me. They both interfere with the story. I really don't like them and wanted them to be taken out the story. And finally, the cruelty that sometimes appears against the Ghost Gang. Eaten or crushed. Well, my conclusion about the program is: half good, half bad."
tt2392179,How could they do this to Pac. They laid him out so lame. And lift him on the program to collect dust.This was not a good site. To watch how they butchered and turned Pac into an annoying wreck is sad.Never watch this. It's not cool. Its nothing like the game to say the least. Its too kiddie and like I said Lame. The Character all of them are uninteresting.
tt2392179,"I forgot about this show for the past years, but it never failed me to laugh to its most scenes. I understand about people somewhat disliking this since it differs from where they think about this show like the animation and voice acting, but for me, it wasn't too bad. I actually like the design of the ghosts, like I would imagine the ghosts from the NES game that what if they have personalities and new appearances.The protagonists are also cute and adorable to be honest. Especially Pac-man, its decent animation tops it all off and make a great contribution to Pac-man's personality. The concept of new power pellets was also interesting like giving new abilities and powers which is very helpful in the battlefield.Overall, it's greatly decent show, I can recommend this to the kids out there or for some who love Pac-man the most."
tt2392179,"This might be one of the worst shows I've ever seen. Nothing clever, or unique about it. First episode, is tolerable but after that, everything goes downhill. The storytelling, the animation, voice acting and your brain cells all begin to get worse after the first episode.My preschooler loves it and that makes sense because it appears to have been created by preschoolers."
tt2392179,"I understand the lip syncing, may be bad, and the show relies on character cliche, but focus on the good things about this show, such as:
The voice acting is at least passable.Some hilarious moments here and there.The characters aren't always clichéd.There is also a bit of a great grasp of the source material, particularly Pac-Man eating the ghosts.The computer animation is decent, although really weird at times."
tt2392179,"My kids are addicted to this cartoon and it is absolute torture for my husband and I. I love certain cartoons (Adventure Time, Regular Show) and I find others to be pleasant tolerances (Ninja Turtles, Mystery Incorporated, Star Wars Rebels). But this cartoon makes me cringe every time it is on. Pacman and the Ghostly Adventures centers on the daily struggle between Pac World and the lame, unfunny, annoyingly voiced ghosts from the netherworld. In fact, on the topic of voices, every voice in this cartoon is like nails on a chalkboard. I understand that this cartoon is aimed at 7-9 old kids, but why on earth is the writing so, so terrible and preschoolish? I feel like my kids are tuned into Disney Jr., which is aimed at preschool aged kiddos. There is potential in terms of interesting story arches, but the writers entirely miss the mark. Pacman lost his parents shortly after a massive civil war that happened on Pacworld, the entire division of Pacpeople and ghosts is a result of the outcome of the war, and there are multiple backstories that are potentially dark and mysterious. The writers barely explore these subplots and it is a shame, because kids can follow sophisticated story lines. Honestly. Oh, the fart, pimple, and burping jokes are nonstop as well. Yay. fun.Good luck staying sane if your kids run across this tripe. It is painful."
tt2392179,"Erin Matthews hasn't really been in much before Kid vs. Kat, but I feel that she gradually became a popular VA icon with Disney XD for both that show and this one, Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures. Like Samurai Jack, the writers of this show are smart enough to keep up the good work more than half the time and almost always have good episodes, which makes it worth while for The Mysterious Mr. Enter to review the 10 best of all 52 of them in Admirable Animations.Like My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, this is a new show in a new generation of a toy/video game franchise that's a lot more interesting than what came before it because you can assume that original fans of Pac-Man or My Little Pony that were kids in the 1980s or 1990s grew up to make this newer version with more substance and better characters. I can even recognize Cylindria, Pinky, Inky and Skeebo as the voices of Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Snips and Soarin because I know they are the same VAs. I'm glad they found a new show after 3 seasons of MLP so they're not stuck with the same show forever and have time to voice act in another one.Pac-Man is the Samurai Jack of the show, the noble hero who can fight almost anything, but still has his flaws and limitations. Betrayus is Aku, the hard-to-defeat villain who's very hammy. After 52 episodes, you wonder how the overall premise of the series is going to conclude and you want to see how Samurai Pac-Man eventually finally permanently removes Aku/Betrayus from existence. Let's just hope that if such a revival does come up that ties up all the loose ends from the beginning, it's not an adult audience revival like Samurai Jack, because that will really ruin what made the original kids show great and turn our hero into something really cruel and awful that even the villain would be scared to see."
tt2392179,"I saw the fist episode in 2014 and I like it so I want to see more episodes of this Pac Man TV Series so much that I started to see all the episodes in Netflix and I loved the TV series is fun, catchy and pretty. I recommend this series to every Pac-Man fan (specially Kids from 7-12). From what is this TV show, well Pac a teenager student and his friends Cylindra and Spiral have adventures saving Pac-World from the evil ghost Betrayus and his army of ghost of the Underworld but secretly there are 4 ghosts (Blinky, Inky, Pinky and Clyde) allies of Pac and his friends that tell Pac the evil plans of Betrayus. The only problem I found to the TV series is that I really want soon a season 3 or finally Pac find his parents"
tt2392179,"Seems that the wrong shows gets a lot a hate. Seriously, it's not even that bad. If you want truly De Niro-awful shows, then go check out The CatDog, The Mighty B, Pearlie, Sidekick, Scaredy Squirrel and The Goode Family. Sure, it may have some taste like debate situations, but that isn't going to stop it from being a terrible show. Anyways, to start the review: TPac-Man and The Ghostly Adventures is an excellent show. The acting and animation is so grand, the premise is awesome, the jokes are very funny, the action scenes are awesome and everything about this show is good. I've never seen any show that could pull of the combination of humor and action that good, but this show did it like a master. I find Andrea Libman very interesting before this show even existed. My most favorite character from the series is the awesome female buttkicker Cylindria because she is soooooo adorable. Anyways, the show deserves more love love. I hope this just as memorable as Courage the Cowardly Dog!"

tt2392179,"This show is by far the Greatest Cartoon i've ever seen.This show is that good people. It has Great characters, A good and rather intimidating villain, and a great plot to the series.Although i DO have some problems with people saying that this show is really bad. It's not bad at all.People say that the characters are the worst and are really stupid. NO, No they're not. The characters are the best. Cylindria is the smartest, she helps Pac and Spiral with whatever they need, Spiral is the strongest (and tallest) of the three. he is always there to put up a fight. The Ghost Gang are the funniest and most amazing parts of the show itself.And the villain of the show is amazing, he may act like a child at times, but that's what makes him funny. He's also one of the most Intimidating villain characters i've ever seen.But what bugs me the most...is that People out there say...that this show doesn't go along with the Plot of the original game. and you know what? I would agree with that. The Show doesn't follow along with the game's plot, and I'll agree with that...If not for one small tiny detail, and that is the fact that THE ORIGINAL PAC-MAN GAME HAS NO PLOT!!!!The game is just Pac-Man chasing four ghosts inside a maze and eating dots. And that's it. No Plot, or Story, to conceive of that. i mean sure it has characters, and is a well known game, but still...the game has no plot. and yet it's still successful.The original Pac-Man Game has no plot, and don't argue with me and say ""yes it does."" NO IT DOESN'T!!! and I'm right, it's a plot-less, and really successful game. So saying that a cartoon doesn't go along with a video game's plot, ONE THAT HAS NO PLOT, is Completely Pointless.I LOVE this show. I will always love this show. It's a masterpiece and i think it should continue with either another season or a movie. I recommend this show to others, and i suggest that people give this show a chance.I really love this show, and I really do wish that the show had another season, or a theatrical Movie. It's that good people, it's that good.I suggest you give this show a chance. I give this show a 10/10 Rating. It's the Best Show i've ever seen"
tt2392179,"I understand namco wanted to make the new pacman show for the new generation, which is understandable because pac-man was starting to be forgotten about. I've watched some episodes, and i will say this: The animation is good (S1 ep 1 part 1 and 2's are pretty good, the rest of the series is kinda mediocre but still good) the ghosts (Inky,Blinky,Pinky,Clyde) have somewhat a personality (same with pac man's friends) One problem is that the fart jokes are VERY unfunny. Especially since pac man is the one who holds that gimmick, it's gross and annoying. But overall i recommend this show if you like pac-man, it's on Netflix (it also used to air on Disney XD from 2013-2016) : )"
tt2392179,"Maybe the show's not perfect but I enjoyed the lore/worldbuilding, especially the Netherworld/ghosts! (I think the antaghostnists are the most memorable thing in the cartoon in general) The animation is pretty good too (for example Betrayus has very dynamic movements/expressions), some of the character designs are really nice and the show has quite a big cast of episodic/background characters. The visual style is pretty vibrant, colorful and recognizable. Each episode has its own plot but there's also a global storyline. If you want to give it a try, I suggest watching Episode 1 & 2, it's a bit like a 40-minute-long movie (they're connected)."
tt2392179,"To all haters of this serie.If you don't like the serie then don't watch, same goes for videos on YouTube, if you don't like the content of the video then don't watch the video.Commenting on the video does nothing, most of the time, the creator would just ignore it.Also don't listen to the haters they are the evil just cuz something new happens it doesn't. Mean it's bad if you don't like something then don't do it, why would you Even do something you don't likeTo all non haters,
This serie was great. And I wish for a new season or maybe 2 or 3 more, who knows what happens in the future. Best regards Holdulv."
tt3282076,Had some okay action sequences but the story was lacking in more ways then one. The acting didn't help much either.
tt3282076,"Is it a comedy or a drama? Is it a satire or is it simply farcical?
From the outset, it's hard to tell. It's also badly directed. De Palma uses his scoring style from the 70's, which in turn was like a homage to Hitchcock, but it worked then. The music feels very out of place immediately and its jarring.He has made some great films, no question. But it's been over 20 years since he's made a decent one. Or even one that wasn't terrible. Mission to Mars, for example, is absolutely woeful. And Domino isn't far off.He takes some great actors, four significant ones, and makes them look like amateur theatre performers. I'm embarrassed for them.A split screen sequence in the middle is quite dramatic but it's not as horrifying as it should be. The scriptwriter must take much of the blame too. The emotional portions feel like they're not written by an adult.There are potential ideas here; you have topical and political notions but they're badly executed. Excuse the pun.A basic fight scene is amateurish. Lazy directing. Was De Palma sick that day? Is this a TV movie? It's all over the place.De Palma has tarnished his own reputation. Most directors falter in old age. But most will still strike upon a decent film every now and then. De Palma should retire. This is a bad movie, following a string of bad movies.He really did make some great pictures back in the 70's and early 80's. And yet, despite the recent documentary about him in which he mostly sung his own praises, he is not of the calibre of some of his contemporaries such as Francis Ford Coppola, Marty Scorsese and others.
If you haven't seen his earlier work, check out Body Double, Carrie or Blow Out. Alas Brian, we knew him well. Before he lost his touch."
tt3282076,"A funny thing happened on the way to the screen...DOMINO never finds its way to a story. A screenplay by Petter Skavlan in the hands of Brian De Palma doesn't gel, and the audience is left wondering why. Nice cast - and perhaps it is the popularity of Games of Thrones' stars Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Carice van Houten that will draw some people to the theater. But the film is not Brian De Palma vintage!Somewhere hidden in the bizarre camera work and odd colorations of the film is a tale about police officer Christian (Nicolaj Coster-Waldau) and his fellow officer Lars Hansen (Søren Malling), married to MS stricken Hanne (Paprika Steen), and the hunt for the perpetrator of Lars' murder. Fellow officer Alex (Carice van Houten), who just happens to have been Lars' secret girlfriend, helps Christian search for the killer as does officer Joe Martin (Guy Pearce) - all of whom cope with the identities of Eriq Ebouaney and Thomas W. Gabrielsson as suspects. And if the aforementioned sounds iffy, that is the film's major problem. Couple that with the very strange cinematography by José Luis Alcaine and the inappropriately 'pretty' musical score by Pino Donaggio and a sound track that presents challenges, and DOMINO!Somewhere a movie got lost in the shuffle."
tt3282076,Who ever wrote the score (music) for this movie should be stabbed in the EARS
tt3282076,"So you're told to watch a movie about a terrorist plot, starring Guy Pearce, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Carice van Houten and Søren Malling. And you think ""Hey, I know these guys, they are good actors!"". You are told that Brian De Palma is directing, and you think ""Brian 'Scarface' De Palma? Let's watch this!""90 minutes later you are still trying to wrap your head around the impossibly bad movie that you have been subjected to.How on Earth did this happen? Yeah, the Trivia section mentions production issues and all that, but then again, what the hell was this? Let's just forget this movie exists and move on."
tt3282076,"This movie is pretty decent. The score and camera work reminds me of Body Double, another De Palma film. Maybe the music used works better in a NY or LA setting but it wasn't a movie killer for me. Terrorist plotline is somewhat worn out for me but still held my attention. Give the film a try.6/10"
tt3282076,"Bad acting all round. Awful dramatic music and unbelievable script.
Made laugh that at a crime scene the CSI are all in masks and gloves with shoe covers. The main character of the film walks right through the crime scene in his own shoes.
Don't waste 90 minutes of your life watching this tosh. It's the turkey of the year for me"
tt3282076,"It's hard to believe that De Palma, the guy who directed great movies like ""Blow Out"" and ""Scarface"" directed this terrible movie. The direction is terrible, this may be one of De Palma's worst. An example of one of the worst parts from this movie is the rooftop chase scene in the first 20 minutes of the movie. It was so lame, and the camera work was terrible."
tt3282076,"One of the worst movies of all time, the scene at the stadium is stupid beyond imagination, if you get there, your TV should be switched off, but do not waste your time, do not start to watch it at all"
tt3282076,"It's a cool little espionage flick with a lot of Hitchcockian inspiration thrown in for good measure. It still manages to feel like a De Palma movie despite a smaller budget than some of his other projects. With movies like this I tend to worry about the intentions of the artist when turning terrorism to any minor or major extent into something that is meant to entertain, but I see no point here for any of this other than that the main character is both weak and flawed, just as we are; such is the point of any Hitchcockian thriller. Watch this film, don't attempt to gather any major message or fact from it because it will just begin to drive you crazy. It's great entertainment, and not much else beyond that."
tt3282076,"I'm a big De Palma fan, and i have loved almost every film he has made. Ok, its not one of his best films, but giving it 1 and 2 stars is just ridiculous. It has all the elements a De Palma film should have and i really enjoyed the way he builds up the suspense in the story. I loved the slow motion scene in the bullfight arena. I know it's a bit weird that all the Danish actors talk English, but i didn't mind. I myself are Danish and i know all the actors from Danish and they are all great actors. I would recommend everyone who like De Palma films to watch it and forget about all the hater's reviews."
tt3282076,What happened to Guy Pierce. His acting is atrocious ! And how can someone go from Game of Thrones to this bomb ? The music sounds like a 1950s soundtrack and DePalma should be told to just enjoy old age and spare us from wasting our time .
tt3282076,Sure Mr. Palma has directed some worthwhile movies but sadly this isn't one. Calls to question whether he ever were much of an director after all. Some times the production team carries the production to completion. I'd might rewatch this on acid for much needed visuals.
tt3282076,This is once of the worst films i've seen! Was this purely put together to get views from game of thrones fans? This is so poor. C movie at best
tt3282076,"One sentence: nothing good about this ""movie""! De Palma's worst ever!"
tt3282076,"Another piece of cr.p from a ""Chosen Ones"". Propaganda for blind sheeps. I think the actors were aware of what kind of bullsh.t project they are working on - and there for they give a 0 effort..."
tt3282076,"This film is really a good movie for those who like old style crime movies and the direction of De Palma is really beautiful, those who like this director will love this movie too"
tt3282076,"First of all the sound track was Horrible. Lackluster acting, weak plot, the action scenes were poorly choreographed. You see the guy from Game of Thrones and you think it should be good, nope."
tt3282076,"Pino Donaggio's music accompanies a very entertaining film shot in different European locations including Belgium, Denmark and Spain, with a nice cinematography and the slow motion, split diopters, tracking shots which guarantee the signature of Brian De Palma"
tt3282076,I don't get all the 1 and 2 ratings on here.This is a typical De Palma film. It does have all the elements one could remember from other movies by De Palma. The musical score fits it well and reminded me of the dramatic music in say Body Double or Blow Out.I thought is was a good watch. Definately not deserves a 1 or 2 rating.So don't mind all the negatives on here. When you like De Palma and a good thriller go see it.
tt3282076,The acting by Guy Pierce and his wife or girlfriend was terrible. How can someone go from Game of Thrones to this is beyond me. The music sounds like it came from a 1950s movie. Put DePalma out to rest somewhere !
tt7127976,I really was looking forward to this because there are not many female comics in india but this was as disappointing as it gets
tt7127976,"Female comedians when they're good do bring their own unique perspectives but when they start talking about their genitals, intercourse or being single.. that's a sure shot red flag that it would be woke comedy that lacks good content or skill.I'd suggest you watch clips of Urooj or Prasasthi if you want to enjoy a laugh with a few of the better female comedians of the crop."
tt7127976,"Its important to remember that comedy at times needs to be simple when your probably not in the best frame of mind to consume it because that's what makes you laugh. 
Cool stuff Aditi."
tt8507516,"There is a lot of hit & miss in Mr Fuzz's jokes. Maybe because I am from Malaysia so I dont really understand his singaporean related joke. Majority of his audience is singapore so they are laughing out loud because they understand him. One thing I dont like is the vulgar that of course, he got it from watching recent american comedian. He is from asia, should just show asian identity that is more ""soft"" and courteous. Just watch Douglas Lim & Harith Iskander, there is too many vulgar american comedian out there who is better than him so when he is doing the same, looks very awkward and unnatural."
tt7149916,"The actor, like walking 100 yard with a knife in his heart, the writers who thought he could do it, or the director who made things happen that aren't plausible."
tt7149916,"Grade F movie, wasted my time watching it. Poor acting and story line. Cringe lines as well. Seriously, worse movie ever. I had to sign up with Imdb just to write this review. Whoever is involved please dont make movies anymore."
tt7149916,"Really, oh my God, what utter drivel!! The main male Chinese actor is so so bad. The story line so ridiculous and obvious. Who in the hell is telling these people to act in these utterly stupid movies!"
tt7149916,"Why so much backlash? Is it because the actors are Chinese and some of the critiques can't stand Asians?I mean c'mon, aren't many of the scenes in most of the box office Hollywood action movies abnormal and doesn't usually happen in real-life? So why is there so much negativity when it comes to this movie?Obviously this movie does not deserve 8+ stars as it has a few flaws here and there (like most action movies do), but in my opinion it deserves at least 6+ stars considering, I never found the movie boring and never fell asleep even once and I found the acting and script pretty acceptable."
tt7149916,"I never give 1s and very rarely give 10s so a 6 means a very watchable movie.The one reason is it's a very tense, edge of your lazyboy, suspense movie. You are engaged throughout, care about the actors, and for the most part are glued to your TV.There is just one predictable, pretty lame, scene with a knife at the end that makes you roll your eyes but, that's it.If you found this helpful please hit ""Yes"""
tt7149916,"Lust!
Bad acting!
Cheap and simple!
Predictable, worthless...
All are words that describes this flick."
tt7149916,"I really enjoyed this film. I thought the story was interesting and a new twist on an old favorite. I agree Patrick (Shen Lin) was not the best actor here, but the character was interesting and we were rooting for him. There are some familiar actors in the cast - - not surprisingly because Bobby Roth also directs Prison Break, as well as numerous episodes of various popular dramas like Grey's Anatomy, Criminal Minds, and Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D. Sounds pretty well-connected. I didn't watch Prison Break but recognize Rockmond Dunbar from his woke family character in 911. The videography is good, the venue is good, there are some interesting surprises.I see at least 2 reviews mention something about a hidden message; one which implied it has to do with the deer. This makes me wish people would just say what they mean rather than talk in riddles to avoid having to add a spoiler tag. Do they think this is pay-back for killing the buck? If so, I (as an animal lover and a vegetarian) disagree that the writer had this in mind. Being in a hunting lodge is super common American fare, especially for a thriller film.I think a lot of the low stars in this forum are just disappointed in two Chinese actors being the leads. But if it makes you feel better, the story was written by a Daxing Zhang. So it's not just the them ""trying to break into Hollywood"" as one person claimed. Their women have actually never had a problem literally already being in Hollywood (becoming a sex symbol after we sent out military overseas in WWII). And there are some famous men, as well, including Bruce Lee, Jet Li, and Jackie Chan. Because this film simply doesn't deserve the low stars. It's well-paced, intriguing, surprising, and at times tender."
tt7149916,"Was this movie of the year? Not really. Would I watch this again? Probably not. But I still liked this one. Story was simple enough, even romantic. This wasn't the average action flick where hero is punching and kicking the bad guys until all of them, the hero included, look like a pile of raw meat. There were plenty of moments which reminded me of MacGyver (original series), which up to this day still remains on my personal top 10 favorites list. Hero is basically an average joe with no skills or means to gun down the bad guys.I warmly recommend this if you're like me, in serious need of a break from shaky cam and god-modding meatheaded heroes."
tt7149916,"For the first five minutes, I was completely confused about what I was watching as four or five actors with roles in Prison Break made an appearance. That was where my curiosity died a cruel death because this film is predictable beyond belief. There were no plot twists and I could see the ending a mile away, which is a shame because I like many of the featured actors. Don't waste your time and find a Robert Patrick film that actually showed his skills instead. My first review because this film was THAT bad!"
tt7149916,"Don't waste your time on this typical and predictable crap. Poor acting, poor storyline."
tt7149916,Cartoonishly bad. It's not 1 star because it's very professionally put together from the point of camera and sound but otherwise it was written directed and acted for trash. Is this Chinese money laundering? Does Robert Patrick owe the IRS?. Wow this is seriously bad
tt7149916,"Bad bad bad please stop taking chinese money so they can use chinese actors.
this film is just a paycheck for the bad actors.
this truely is the worst film that i have ever has the misfortune to see"
tt7149916,"Not as bad as the numerous ""1"" ratings might suggest. This is a typical home invasion movie, yes a little predictable, but it kept me on the edge of my seat for an hour and a half, which works for me. Some good acting, Especially the guy that plays Jack, and some bad acting (the stab victim), and a few good twists."
tt7149916,"Main guy acted like a robot...
Plot was cliche as hell. Shame about the supporting cast.
Felt like a paycheck only acting gig."
tt7149916,Watching the trailer I thought this could be a nice movie.. when I started the movie I realized that maybe it wasn't so good! BUT thumbs up for making me watch it till the end while being so freaking curious about what's gonna actually happen!!! 🙃
tt7149916,It's predictable but it's not as garbage as some of these 1/10 reviews.
tt7149916,"I cant imagine I wasted 1h41mins watching such a movie !
It has no story behind it i doubt there was a script !
And the most annoying thing was this chinese guy with the knife stuck in his heart he kept wiggling the whole movie like the jackie chan movie !
I would have gave it less than 1 if there was a zero"
tt7149916,This is an awful movie. Plain and simple! I thought for a bit that it might be good for a day when you are hungover but it is just laughable. The dialogue and the actors are not of this world.
tt7149916,"Crap! Only 1 star cos there's no zero!
Acting terrible. Screenshots dire. A whole lot of mess."
tt8976710,"Easy to follow, relaxed watch. Laughs throughout. A feel relaxed movie for a lazy day."
tt8976710,Marlon Wayans put his physical comedy and multiple characterizations on display and carried pretty much the entire movie on his own. I wouldn't go comparing his effort to Eddaie Murphy but for a guy who makes his way being goofy and all over the place he did a good job in his multiple roles. I only wished he performed as well playing his regular character as he did the others. Russell is the star of this movie.
tt8976710,"Off top, you have to like this style. Wayans have been making movies for decades. This latest is just the next in line. It has a solid storyline and it has the Wayans style of comedy. I've seen better movies but this is definitely not a one star movie. Forget the low reviews and check it out for yourself!"
tt8976710,"I grew up watching wayans brothers movies and marlon was my favourite, but my god what happened to him?? This movie if filled with old, tired and unfunny cliche bits (not even from his old movies, from generic comedies)
I have to assume the chemistry of the acting is due to the fact it's all the same person talking to each other but the script and dialogue is shockingly dull.
The storyline is half decent, and the idea for the movie is mildly interesting but it just doesn't hold up.
If they worked on the script a little more and tried some more progressive humour it might actually work as a half decent comedy, but if you compare this to the old stuff he used to do it's just awful."
tt8976710,Without doubt this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I am slightly disappointed in myself for watching this all the way through.
tt8976710,"Like the title says, this Nutty Professor-like movie is extremely painful and cringeworthy. If you like a B-rated 90's movie, this might be something for you, if you don't, i suggest you don't watch this."
tt8976710,"I really wanted to like this film. Was hoping for some White Chicks vibes. But clearly i was mistaken. I found the first 30 minutes of the movie to be funny. And had a few laughs while watching. After than it wasn't even funny anymore. Really sad because usually
I find Wayans to be pretty funny. But lately he's gotten to comfy it feels. He's such a good actor and really does great impersonations, and does very well playing such messed up characters. The humor was just way to dull. It definitely lacked something."
tt8976710,"Had a few laughs here and there throughout the movie. Not Marlon's best work in my opinion, but definitely not his worst. You can tell he put much effort into it and really enjoyed making it. The storyline is coherent and it's impressive how he manages to portray seven different charachters and keep their mannerisms apart. Although some of the characters aren't always believable and the acting is sometimes a little over the top, it still worked for me and I had a fun experience watching the film."
tt8976710,"Marlon Wayans is hilarious. He's a great representative of his legendary family. He can do drama(Requiem For A Dream) and lowbrow comedy. He does great standup. White Girls is a classic movie for some..50 Shades Of Black is a great level of Wayans silliness. A Haunted House is dumb fun. But this film disappoints me...No doubt playing six different characters takes talent, but the jokes were falling flat 85% of the time. Still, this may be good for those who want lighthearted silliness and no raunchiness-it's treading on the edge of being family-friendly. Still, the jokes fell flat. I wanted to like this movie but it was ridiculous, and not in a good way.If you watch this film, do it for love and support of Marlon; like me you'll be entertained by the work he puts in as the sextuplets. Still we all have to hope that he gets better movies to display his wacky comedy."
tt8976710,"I thought this was hilarious, nearly choked laughing at one point last night. And he did so well playing all the characters himself that I am sure is no mean feat. I don't understand all the bad reviews? Probably from younger ones that don't get that silly humour from years ago and are offended by everything ? I dunno. Loved it. Looking forward to the next one. Cliche but please bring out white chicks 2 🙏"
tt8976710,"This movie was its own, Marlon did good. If anybody was looking to compare it to the family show from his past you might not like it. Accept it for what it is a keep it moving. It was silly and funny, different personalities made you think of people from family, friends and coworkers. I liked it 👍"
tt8976710,Really unfunny movie. People writing reviews saying if you don't find it funny you don't understand the culture. Get a grip. It's supposed to be a comedy. It's supposed to make you laugh. It's not funny and is in fact cringe worthy. Simple as that.
tt8976710,"This is by far one of the worst Wayan movies out there, probably good for the low brow people out there who enjoy mindless quips and utterly stupid scenarios.The Wayans were once funny, what happened?"
tt8976710,"This has to be the worst excuse of a film I have ever seen in my life! Like seriously who actually green lit this bull? Don't waste your time watching it, go out and watch insects walking on the ground it more entertaining than whatever this is."
tt8976710,"Damon; ""Goofy comedies"" had their day in the 90's, when you were actually 35y.o.
Admittedly I didn't watch the whole movie, so I can only really critique the first 5 minutes."
tt8976710,"Avoid
1 Star because I couldn't give 0 or 1/2
This is supposed to be a comedy but you will be hard pressed to even crack a smile during it"
tt8976710,Based on Marlon's miss after miss after miss track record last couple years I'm giving this movie a 2/10 based on the trailer alone. Please stop enabling him Netflix and pull the plug.
tt8976710,"A weak and poor screenplay, make this movie a boring time. It's ok to try Eddie Murphy's formula, but with such high standards, you gotta make it real good. Unfortunately, the poor jokes, bad performing by Marlon, and utterly forgetable characters can make this one a worth the time. Skip this one, don't say I didn't warn you."
tt8976710,"Not as funny as many of his movies, but I like the story and it was still entertaining to watch, laughed a bit here and there."
tt8976710,"I do love Marlon Wayans. Takes the piss out of white and black stereotypes. That's exactly what I love him for. This is Comedy!
This isn't his best movie but its a fun late night comedy. If you love to watch a painful and cringeworthy comedy; this is the movie for you. If you are reading other reviews saying its ""Offensive"" clearly they are no fun at parties. (Snowflakes)."
tt8976710,"I do not normally write reviews of movies but that being said I think this one is getting shade for the wrong reasons. I grew up in the 80s and 90s when comedy was simple and fun, this movie was exactly that simple and fun! Take it for what it is like I did and it will be one of the best comedies you have seen in a long time, not to bulgur but not to clean....just right!"
tt8976710,His sister is by far the funniest. As the movie started I didn't have high hopes but i ended up being pleasantly surprised.
tt8976710,No Comment...using time on this movie is like self sufocating...
tt9419834,The best part of this movie are these reviews. A+ content.
tt9419834,The stairs were the best plot decide in the entire movie.
tt9419834,I wish they showed more of the bathrooms. Wanna see how they decorated it.
tt9419834,"It was my night to pick the movie, and 'Secret Obsession' popped up at the top of my Netflix account, so I thought rather than spending an hour sifting through the choices, I'd take Netflix's recommendation.Throughout the movie my husband made several comments about how unrealistic the plot was, and I agreed, but for some reason we sat through it, thinking it would get better...As the movie ended, my husband left the room to make a phone call. I didn't think much of it, but he was gone for quite some time. When he returned 30 minutes later, he was brandishing divorce papers he had printed out himself on our new hp printer. I didn't even know a person could procure divorce papers so quickly! I begged and pleaded with him to forgive me, but he said he couldn't be with anyone who would hurt him like that. A part of me knows that it's the truth. He deserves better. We all do."
tt9419834,"This film is based on a completely improbable scenario: Russell (Mike Vogel) is apparently a smooth tempered and fulfilled man but he is actually 'relatively' unbalanced. Thus, he will implement a far-fetched stratagem in order to capture Jennifer (Brenda Song), the woman he loves unilaterally, while she is not even aware of his attraction to her. Despite the presence of Dennis Haysbert with his mesmerizing voice, the film is strongly disappointing. I do not really known how but I unexpectedly managed to see the movie until the end. Please do not make the same mistake and do not even start it!As a synthesis: 2/3 of 10"
tt9419834,"Ok so the plot and premise isn't really anything new - however the film really does it's hardest to make you interested in the film. The first act of the film is a little confusing. I almost stopped watching after first 10 minutes or so - however i am glad I stuck with it. Brenda Song does really well and is the stand out for me - great job at breaking her 'Suite Life' label. Good Acting. It could've developed the detectives character a bit better. It won't thrill you to bits, but i found it a pleasant surprise."
tt9419834,I had a restlessness night and this movie managed to help me take a nap. Went straight to sleep with absolutely no concern for Jennifer.
tt9419834,"Not sure why this is getting such bad reviews. Yes there might be some silly moments where you shout at the TV but all these kind of movies are like that. My wife and I sat and enjoyed this movie and so might you, give it a try"
tt9419834,Best thing about this movie is the reviews aahh. I just watched and thought how could you do this to me Netflix😂😂😂If you want to feel better after watching read the reviews
tt9419834,Couldn't stop thinking that this was an Allstate commercial. Overall movie was predictable and hilarious! Russell's photoshopping skills gave him away.
tt9419834,"I was in trouble in the opening scenes when she couldn't get her car started, but the windshield wipers were working."
tt9419834,This script was written in one hour at 3 in the morning and then the document got deleted so they tried to recreate the script that they couldn't remember because it was written at 3 in the morning.
tt9419834,"Do not waste your time. Netflix seems to be giving everyone money to make movies without caring about the finished product.
Bad plot + bad screenplay + bad acting = bad movie."
tt9419834,"This isn't the best movie ever, but defineptly not terrible. If you're someone who is into lifetime suspense movies then you'll enjoy this.
A bit predictable but still enjoyable."
tt9419834,"Despite the trailer, this is a very clever movie about the afterlife, where President Palmer is stuck in hell after being killed and has to spend eternity as a lame detective. He meets London Tipton, who isn't rich anymore, and they... oh. My husband said that's not the plot. I guess it was just a really bad movie. Pity."
tt9419834,"I don't get it. The guy provided a beautiful home for his ""wife"". Walkout kitchen, hardwood floors, treed lot. What's not to like? Oh and did she even consider all the work he put into her rehab? Cooking meals? What about his photoshop skills? You think a well rounded man like that comes along every day? Nah, no appreciation for him whatsoever.A guy can't catch a break these days."
tt9419834,It's so bad that I felt disrespected by Netflix. Now they're making any generic movie to convince users that's worth it paying a monthly subscription. I should've been paid to spend my time watching this
tt13445242,"It still has the same issues, except half the characters are literally just there with no rhyme or reason, with the exception of Santa, who straight up changes into a raccoon and an owl solely to punish Mistletoe the cat that somehow is green. Theres no explanation, hes just green. There also these 3 smaller kittens that Santa kidnaps and gives it to Mistletoe, thus giving him more punishment. After that, Spookley does the only good thing to run into the woods to save Mistletoe, but gets brutally beaten by the weather. After a few bland musicals, we learn at the end that the farm is indeed runned by legit humans. Or just 2 kids, and the parents fled, which makes me question: If this was a sequel, then how do the humans not realize that their scarecrow is stupid, the pumpkins are alive, and they have 2 bats- oh speaking of the 2 bats, they hardly appear. They seem to have just died in the bridge thanks to the cold. Thats the only good thing I can say about this movie. Kind of wished the scarecrow got attacked too."
tt13445242,"It's okay, the animation is very good, better then the original, but it's music is a little, boring.The poster is a good recap of what i've said, the story, is, well, alright, I think more of the cats would be cute."
tt13445242,My daughter absolutely loves this. We've watched this about 15 times already ... this weekend. The songs are cute and it's a sweet message. And she sings along with the music and dances so I approve of this interactive tv experience. If you have a child under 3 I bet they'll enjoy the adorable colorful kittens!!
tt13445242,"The animation in this film is just *chefs kiss* and the characters designs are a 10/10. The lip syncing is clearly done professionally as well as the voice acting. The songs in this are an absolute BOP and ""sung"" soooooooo well!I love the colour scheme of the cat! The bright green really created an amazing contrast against the red! And his voice perfectly matched it! (He's my favourite- he's hot, don't know his name tho)"
tt13669344,"Whoever wrote the screenplay was high because this movie isn't funny, nor does it have a plot"
tt13669344,Comment on peut réaliser un film aussi mauvais ? Un film aussi mal écrit ? Un film aussi malsain ? Un film aussi vulgaire ? Un film aussi débile ? Et surtout comment peut-on produire ça ?
tt13669344,"Don't waste time, i made the account just to say this"
tt13669344,"A crazy cartoony comedy. Derived from the internet series ""en passant pécho"" of which I had found several amusing episodes, I found the film a little heavy and a little long."
tt13669344,"There is no story, this movie encourage me to create an account and add a negative note."
tt13669344,"If your going to enjoy yourself watching this raunchy comedy with good humor. IF NOT, you'll be uncomfortable the whole movie. This is a good movie to just laugh too. You have to have fun with it."
tt13669344,"Very bad movie , me too i just created an account to write how bad this movie is !!
film tres mauvais , il y as pas d histoire , totalement nul !"
tt13669344,"...but I laughed my ass off through the movie and really had a great time.It's dumb, crude, weird, vulgar and violent and not to be taken seriously at all.Kind of refreshing in its own way."
tt13669344,"The actors are very bad, the scenes even worse. History is to be thrown in the trash. Too many vulgar scenes and swear words. I do not understand the cinematic object"
tt13669344,"Light it up and get ready to die laughing!
These guys are killing it"
tt13669344,Havent seen a pure comedy in such a long time. Reminds me of luis de funes. Great comedy!!
tt13669344,"If you want to laugh and past a good time just go for it, it's hard, it's trash, it's totally hardcore humor and it's really good as it is!There is not a big plot around it, but the facial expression of the actors and all the funny scene they got in are really good!If you ve liked How High, dumb and dumber and movies like that you will really like it! The actor are really great, they always go straight to get into troubles cause they are hilariously dumb!Do not listen to bad critics and give it a try, you ll see! The humor inside this movie will not be for everyone taste, as i told you, if you don't liek this kind of humor you will not like it. But if you do like me, you will past a really good time!"
tt2392179,"Terribly cheesy voice-acting, cliché villain, horribly written characters, and humor that relies on fart jokes all combine to make this lame show.Honestly I don't understand that love for this whatsoever and the fact that someone here actually compared it to a masterpiece such as Courage the Cowardly Dog is ridiculous.Everything apart from the animation is terrible in this show.It's basically the Sonic Boom for Disney, relying on crap humor, a cliché terribly written plot, and flat characters that they constantly try to add depth to but honestly the characters are irredeemable. The show pretty much relies solely on the edgy teenager cliché for the characters.Basically everything that's been done in this show was done about 10 years ago but was done far better back then."
tt2392179,"I love this show for the clean animation and Erin Matthews' performance as PAC-MAN is amazing. Also, the stories are well written. The Ghost Gang (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde) are my favorite characters. Betrayus is also a lot of fun. Pinky and Pac-Man are one of the best couples. The only things I didn't like were two: First, Cylindria and Spiral. They are torture to me. They both interfere with the story. I really don't like them and wanted them to be taken out the story. And finally, the cruelty that sometimes appears against the Ghost Gang. Eaten or crushed. Well, my conclusion about the program is: half good, half bad."
tt2392179,How could they do this to Pac. They laid him out so lame. And lift him on the program to collect dust.This was not a good site. To watch how they butchered and turned Pac into an annoying wreck is sad.Never watch this. It's not cool. Its nothing like the game to say the least. Its too kiddie and like I said Lame. The Character all of them are uninteresting.
tt2392179,"I forgot about this show for the past years, but it never failed me to laugh to its most scenes. I understand about people somewhat disliking this since it differs from where they think about this show like the animation and voice acting, but for me, it wasn't too bad. I actually like the design of the ghosts, like I would imagine the ghosts from the NES game that what if they have personalities and new appearances.The protagonists are also cute and adorable to be honest. Especially Pac-man, its decent animation tops it all off and make a great contribution to Pac-man's personality. The concept of new power pellets was also interesting like giving new abilities and powers which is very helpful in the battlefield.Overall, it's greatly decent show, I can recommend this to the kids out there or for some who love Pac-man the most."
tt2392179,"This might be one of the worst shows I've ever seen. Nothing clever, or unique about it. First episode, is tolerable but after that, everything goes downhill. The storytelling, the animation, voice acting and your brain cells all begin to get worse after the first episode.My preschooler loves it and that makes sense because it appears to have been created by preschoolers."
tt2392179,"I understand the lip syncing, may be bad, and the show relies on character cliche, but focus on the good things about this show, such as:
The voice acting is at least passable.Some hilarious moments here and there.The characters aren't always clichéd.There is also a bit of a great grasp of the source material, particularly Pac-Man eating the ghosts.The computer animation is decent, although really weird at times."
tt2392179,"My kids are addicted to this cartoon and it is absolute torture for my husband and I. I love certain cartoons (Adventure Time, Regular Show) and I find others to be pleasant tolerances (Ninja Turtles, Mystery Incorporated, Star Wars Rebels). But this cartoon makes me cringe every time it is on. Pacman and the Ghostly Adventures centers on the daily struggle between Pac World and the lame, unfunny, annoyingly voiced ghosts from the netherworld. In fact, on the topic of voices, every voice in this cartoon is like nails on a chalkboard. I understand that this cartoon is aimed at 7-9 old kids, but why on earth is the writing so, so terrible and preschoolish? I feel like my kids are tuned into Disney Jr., which is aimed at preschool aged kiddos. There is potential in terms of interesting story arches, but the writers entirely miss the mark. Pacman lost his parents shortly after a massive civil war that happened on Pacworld, the entire division of Pacpeople and ghosts is a result of the outcome of the war, and there are multiple backstories that are potentially dark and mysterious. The writers barely explore these subplots and it is a shame, because kids can follow sophisticated story lines. Honestly. Oh, the fart, pimple, and burping jokes are nonstop as well. Yay. fun.Good luck staying sane if your kids run across this tripe. It is painful."
tt2392179,"Erin Matthews hasn't really been in much before Kid vs. Kat, but I feel that she gradually became a popular VA icon with Disney XD for both that show and this one, Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures. Like Samurai Jack, the writers of this show are smart enough to keep up the good work more than half the time and almost always have good episodes, which makes it worth while for The Mysterious Mr. Enter to review the 10 best of all 52 of them in Admirable Animations.Like My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, this is a new show in a new generation of a toy/video game franchise that's a lot more interesting than what came before it because you can assume that original fans of Pac-Man or My Little Pony that were kids in the 1980s or 1990s grew up to make this newer version with more substance and better characters. I can even recognize Cylindria, Pinky, Inky and Skeebo as the voices of Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Snips and Soarin because I know they are the same VAs. I'm glad they found a new show after 3 seasons of MLP so they're not stuck with the same show forever and have time to voice act in another one.Pac-Man is the Samurai Jack of the show, the noble hero who can fight almost anything, but still has his flaws and limitations. Betrayus is Aku, the hard-to-defeat villain who's very hammy. After 52 episodes, you wonder how the overall premise of the series is going to conclude and you want to see how Samurai Pac-Man eventually finally permanently removes Aku/Betrayus from existence. Let's just hope that if such a revival does come up that ties up all the loose ends from the beginning, it's not an adult audience revival like Samurai Jack, because that will really ruin what made the original kids show great and turn our hero into something really cruel and awful that even the villain would be scared to see."
tt2392179,"I saw the fist episode in 2014 and I like it so I want to see more episodes of this Pac Man TV Series so much that I started to see all the episodes in Netflix and I loved the TV series is fun, catchy and pretty. I recommend this series to every Pac-Man fan (specially Kids from 7-12). From what is this TV show, well Pac a teenager student and his friends Cylindra and Spiral have adventures saving Pac-World from the evil ghost Betrayus and his army of ghost of the Underworld but secretly there are 4 ghosts (Blinky, Inky, Pinky and Clyde) allies of Pac and his friends that tell Pac the evil plans of Betrayus. The only problem I found to the TV series is that I really want soon a season 3 or finally Pac find his parents"
tt2392179,"Seems that the wrong shows gets a lot a hate. Seriously, it's not even that bad. If you want truly De Niro-awful shows, then go check out The CatDog, The Mighty B, Pearlie, Sidekick, Scaredy Squirrel and The Goode Family. Sure, it may have some taste like debate situations, but that isn't going to stop it from being a terrible show. Anyways, to start the review: TPac-Man and The Ghostly Adventures is an excellent show. The acting and animation is so grand, the premise is awesome, the jokes are very funny, the action scenes are awesome and everything about this show is good. I've never seen any show that could pull of the combination of humor and action that good, but this show did it like a master. I find Andrea Libman very interesting before this show even existed. My most favorite character from the series is the awesome female buttkicker Cylindria because she is soooooo adorable. Anyways, the show deserves more love love. I hope this just as memorable as Courage the Cowardly Dog!"
tt2392179,"GHosT CHOMPING AT HIs FeeT Pacs OUR HeROPAC JUST CAN'T Be BeAT YeAH HAHAHAPac-Man yellow, Pac extreme
He's a chowing down machine
Ghosts, monsters, ghouls, and only one can stop them#PacManSweep #GetThemFries."
tt2392179,"This show is by far the Greatest Cartoon i've ever seen.This show is that good people. It has Great characters, A good and rather intimidating villain, and a great plot to the series.Although i DO have some problems with people saying that this show is really bad. It's not bad at all.People say that the characters are the worst and are really stupid. NO, No they're not. The characters are the best. Cylindria is the smartest, she helps Pac and Spiral with whatever they need, Spiral is the strongest (and tallest) of the three. he is always there to put up a fight. The Ghost Gang are the funniest and most amazing parts of the show itself.And the villain of the show is amazing, he may act like a child at times, but that's what makes him funny. He's also one of the most Intimidating villain characters i've ever seen.But what bugs me the most...is that People out there say...that this show doesn't go along with the Plot of the original game. and you know what? I would agree with that. The Show doesn't follow along with the game's plot, and I'll agree with that...If not for one small tiny detail, and that is the fact that THE ORIGINAL PAC-MAN GAME HAS NO PLOT!!!!The game is just Pac-Man chasing four ghosts inside a maze and eating dots. And that's it. No Plot, or Story, to conceive of that. i mean sure it has characters, and is a well known game, but still...the game has no plot. and yet it's still successful.The original Pac-Man Game has no plot, and don't argue with me and say ""yes it does."" NO IT DOESN'T!!! and I'm right, it's a plot-less, and really successful game. So saying that a cartoon doesn't go along with a video game's plot, ONE THAT HAS NO PLOT, is Completely Pointless.I LOVE this show. I will always love this show. It's a masterpiece and i think it should continue with either another season or a movie. I recommend this show to others, and i suggest that people give this show a chance.I really love this show, and I really do wish that the show had another season, or a theatrical Movie. It's that good people, it's that good.I suggest you give this show a chance. I give this show a 10/10 Rating. It's the Best Show i've ever seen"
tt2392179,"I understand namco wanted to make the new pacman show for the new generation, which is understandable because pac-man was starting to be forgotten about. I've watched some episodes, and i will say this: The animation is good (S1 ep 1 part 1 and 2's are pretty good, the rest of the series is kinda mediocre but still good) the ghosts (Inky,Blinky,Pinky,Clyde) have somewhat a personality (same with pac man's friends) One problem is that the fart jokes are VERY unfunny. Especially since pac man is the one who holds that gimmick, it's gross and annoying. But overall i recommend this show if you like pac-man, it's on Netflix (it also used to air on Disney XD from 2013-2016) : )"
tt2392179,"Maybe the show's not perfect but I enjoyed the lore/worldbuilding, especially the Netherworld/ghosts! (I think the antaghostnists are the most memorable thing in the cartoon in general) The animation is pretty good too (for example Betrayus has very dynamic movements/expressions), some of the character designs are really nice and the show has quite a big cast of episodic/background characters. The visual style is pretty vibrant, colorful and recognizable. Each episode has its own plot but there's also a global storyline. If you want to give it a try, I suggest watching Episode 1 & 2, it's a bit like a 40-minute-long movie (they're connected)."
tt2392179,"To all haters of this serie.If you don't like the serie then don't watch, same goes for videos on YouTube, if you don't like the content of the video then don't watch the video.Commenting on the video does nothing, most of the time, the creator would just ignore it.Also don't listen to the haters they are the evil just cuz something new happens it doesn't. Mean it's bad if you don't like something then don't do it, why would you Even do something you don't likeTo all non haters,
This serie was great. And I wish for a new season or maybe 2 or 3 more, who knows what happens in the future. Best regards Holdulv."
tt9527662,It isn't much compared to the original. When I see they rebooted the show I was very excited. But this show is obviously catered to smaller kids. The story line is not engaging and you hold no attachment. The animation is very weak. I really wish they would've try to revive the old show. Or at least tried to have some kinda story arc other than how do we get views on the internet.
tt9527662,"They try too hard to make it funny and kid friendly. The original series seemed more closer to anime style then this new one thats more like a kid cartoon.Also i dont like how the visual graphics looks, the old one looks more like an anime and this new one looks like its for kids."
tt9527662,"I watched this series in my childhood! Bakugan Battle Brawlers is the real thing! This is a fake copy with a whole new story line and new characters. If they wanted to do a so called 'Reboot' they should have used another name too!! Bakugan: Battle Planet only has 1 different word compared to the original Bakugan: Battle Brawlers... This is mockery! This should not be rated positive by anyone who knows the original! I'm not saying the storyline isn't good, but they are making fun of their own series. Now this series is available on Netflix and I'm deeply disappointed. The original is way better for nostalgic reasons & the battles are just crappy now, if they changed the name completely I would have agreed more, but changing only 1 word in the name? Come on now anyone who watched the original series should relate to how I'm feeling now. I was deeply disappointed, the battles are confusing and not good at all, battles have been the exciting part of the series since the start, now it is confusing. You don't know what's happening at all! This is not even worth 1 star for me. 0 stars should be the minimum."
tt9527662,"As a big Bakugan fan I am, I gave Battle Planet a try (on a kids channel called Pop), but 2 or 3 episodes in I disliked it and think it's garbage. The theme song doesn't bring as much hype, as the original theme did, the Bakugans all look robotic, less organic, instead of the looking like actual Animals or mythical creatures or Aliens or other compared to the original series, the characters are boring and childish. They ruined Shun Kazami's & Dan Kuso's characters, I prefer the original Dan & Shun over the new ones, they should have just made new characters instead, the animation looked more like a western world animation, rather than a actual Japanese Anime.This show is very childish, very kiddy friendly, in the original series, it was more grown up as the seasons went on and more mature.I'm sorry But as a OG Bakugan Fan Bakugan Bakugan Brawlers, New Vestroia, Gundalian Invaders and Mechtanium Surge Arc 1/2 will always out beat Battle Planet.Bakugan:Battle Planet is trash."
tt9527662,The reviews up here are mostly lies. the animation is weak and the characters are too childish.
tt9527662,"The reboot of Bakugan is not worth watching.
The animation is weak, so line isn't that great and the bakugan battles are confusing.
The Original Bakugan is much better then this lame and cheap reboot."
tt9527662,"I remember watching the original first season. When Battle Planet was released I was very disapointed. It didn't had anything from the original. Well it had Dan and Drago, but they were just shells of the original once. The new squad is very bad. The fused Shun and Mrucho and we got this weird aquos Shun thing. Also I can't get over with how ugly these CGI bakugan are. The original was enjoyable for even teens and adults but this is just for 4-9 year olds. Also Dan is nothing like the original. Also the series was made in America. So it's no longer anime, I think."
tt9527662,"So I've watched Bakugan Battle Brawlers when I was 6 or 7 and LOVED IT but this... this is just cringe and they didn't keep many things from the original like any of the symbols for the bakugan elements and they didn't keep half the names for the elements. That just makes it seem like they didn't care about the people who watched the original at all. Also most of cartoon networks reboots aren't good no matter how you put it. Yea the animation is good but if your a weeb it feels like a really old anime (like around early 2000s) when it comes to the animation but just with more frames. For the people who are liking the reboot good for you I just personally can't stand how much it feels like a major off brand of bakugan. (Btw why do you pronounce Kuso as Kuzo and not Ku-so that's how it was produced in the original). And one more thing before I submit Drago was more of acting like a tough stubborn kind of guy in the original but now he is just like ""oh you're my partner I'll do whatever you say"" like a big suck up."
tt9527662,"The show isn't bad, the main problem it faces is bad voice acting. Not bad quality wise, the voice actors themselves aren't terrible but the dialogue pacing is terrible, there's even the occasional pause withing a sentence that doesn't belong. All in all it's not the worst thing out there for kids to watch, and it's not inherently worse than it's predecessor, it will likely have your kids begging you to buy them Bakugan toys however."
tt9527662,"What is this? This is not Bakugan at all, I know what I am talking about, the original Bakugan is still the best, this new series is garbage!"
tt9527662,Yes the changed many things but this reboot has good story.
tt9527662,"This is only good if you have a younger kid/sibling who is into this. And you are stuck watching it with them. At max this is 6 stars; with some funny slapstick moments. It can even get cool sometimes and is inclusive with the cast. However, that ain't enough . . .But if you take into fact this isn't nearly as good as other kids shows. Like the original Beyblade series, Yugioh, Medabots, or/and Zoids. Then this is definitely trash tier at about 3 stars. Some people might even say the OG Bakugan is better than this reboot. But honestly it doesn't matter, because even the original wasn't that good.Last two things; those transformation scenes are a tab bit too long, they should consider shortening them. The video games that were on the Wii and DS, were bomb! At least 7 stars out of 10 for those bad boys; if you ever come around them online, or in a mom and paps shop."
tt9527662,"This show is a reboot of a series that I could still safely say had the biggest impact on my childhood and is probably still my favorite show of all time, but I'm not going bore you with my whole life story instead I'm going to talk about the small portion that I watched before I couldn't suffer through it anymore.This show did a great job of being more child friendly and reaching out to its new target audience but sadly that is probably the only good thing I can say about this show. The story was changed so much from the original that you almost can´t compare them at all. Their choice of making all of the Bakugan mechanical instead of living creatures from another dimension/planet completely takes away from one of the main points from the original and some of the character conflicts. ¨Drago¨ the main partner of Dan despised mechanical Bakugan this was one of his defining character moments during the events of the original series' new Vestroia arc, now this being said it was probably a choice to more easily explain Bakugan to children facing the shift to a younger target audience now that being said I almost can't hold it against them because it certainly did maker the show much more simple.Unfortunately, it's almost to a fault the choice to make the show much more simple means that at times in the show they basically throw out all the rules of the show and make the battles harder to follow and the change in the original 6 attributes didn't help with myself being a returning fan the executives overseeing this show made too many changes to ¨ modernize ¨ the show that they basically turned into a pile of hot garbage."
tt9527662,I like bakugans but my sister noticed that some are shaped like letters in the alphabet. My sister said that one looks like a S and the other on looks like an L. It's kinda freaky and I am not wondering why are they shaped like letters. Is it some kind of code? Or they just want to have fun with the bakugan's and shape them like letter from the alphabet? People who have bakugan's check the shape of you bakugan's to see if they are shaped as letters. If you do see letters please make a comment and type which letters. To see if it's a code or not. Well that my Review /comment.
tt9527662,"Now before you say ""But Bakugan is my childhood"", ""CN make a good reboot, are you high?"" ""It's decent but they barley air it"" or some other crap like that just shut up. And on a side note, I made IMDB list of other good reboots on CN. Anyways what I like about this Bakugan is that the battles are more engaging to watch. I know it's par for the course for trading card anime to play out a more epic version of the game in show but at the end of the day it is them just playing the game. The original show was like that too but here the bakugan have more range to fight when compared to the turn based style of the first show, the kids can pitch in by throwing power up baku-cores that can either power or heal a bakugan so the kids aren't rendered useless, plus it also ties into the rules of the new game. Speaking of which checkout the new toys their pretty cool. I also like the 11 minute run time it's rare for an anime to do that and considering that most other card game shows could have been this short if the the meat of the action (the card games) wasn't just playing the game (which that type of format is good but it's great to break away from it every now and then). I like the new look of the creatures since they are basically toys they have a mechanical look to them which is a nice attention to detail. The characters are typical but likable and act more like actual kids, kinda like Craig of the creek. Over all this show is a lot more engaging and fun to watch than some other card game anime in past years like Scan 2 go and Monsuno that aired on Nicktoons. I look forward tot seeing the Bakugan brand grow."
tt9527662,"Very funny, awesome battles, a good story that doesn't reveal to much early on, likeable characters, and good dialogue and character interaction, Bakugan: Battle Planet is everything you want in a reboot. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes Bakugan, game based animes, or even just action packed shows in general."
tt9527662,This Reboot is better than the original this one has nice characters excellent story good dialogue and writing And nice Animation I love this Show Soo much
tt11194508,Think I made my point. What a GOOF! His gf is also an entertaining side note in pretentious affectation! Good times OR was it???? DA DA DUNNNNN........
tt11194508,I always Iove Asian representation. And this one is quite a light hearted show to finish in one go. I quite enjoyed it. But it's just all over the place. The storyline is very weak and incomplete. The drama feels forced and I feel difficult to relate to any of the character.
tt11194508,"There's a lot that you will find confusing when you start off watching this show - because no one is really introduced to the viewers. I'm not a Singaporean local and I don't know who and why anyone should care about any of the people this show follows. And that was what the creator or producer or whoever cuts this show together missed. There should have been better intros so the viewers are meeting new friends but this show makes you feel like you're just a voyeur in these strangers lives. You just begin to follow people who's name flashes across the screen and you just have to watch and figure out for yourself who they really are, what they do and etc. I had to Google some people as I watched because even the show doesn't even show anyone but a few of them actually working on screen. There is too much left out to make you feel really invested to care about some of these peoples outcomes. This show does reveal the many different dynamics of people that exist in the world, especially in this one group of friends. Where each is in a different stage of their lives pursing and achieving different goals but celebrating them together. I was however pulled in by this show because of the truths this show does reveal. The mental difficulties Asian adults / young adults face and constantly struggle with when it comes to becoming your own and breaking traditions in culture."
tt11194508,"There's been many parallels drawn between Crazy Rich Asians and Singapore Social with some reviews calling the latter a ""sequel (to the former) that no one asked for"".Crazy Rich Asians was a box office success. It also fared relatively well amongst critics, and was touted as a game changer in the Hollywood scene.It shone the international spotlight on Singapore and whilst some online commentators raised the lack of ethnic diversity and argued if Newton Hawker Centre should have featured as the Hawker Centre of choice amongst locals, many more were in unison that the film presented Singapore beautifully.Was it an representative view of a regular slice of life in Singapore? No, but neither did it claim to be. In fact, it was in its name itself - that it was a focused anthropology surrounding the lives of Crazy Rich Asians, and in this particular case, some of them happened to be Singaporeans.With Singapore Social however...were they just looking to alliterate? The promotional blurb on the Netflix site for the programme says ""Peer into the lives of young Singaporeans as they defy expectations...""No wonder young Singaporeans took offence - because if you're going to put their young nation into your title name for promotional purposes globally, then you better do it justice.And to do it justice, please first take a look at who should be given the rights to tell our story.It's a known fact that CRA featured an Asian American director Jon Chu, with Kevin Kwan the Singapore-born novelist as counsel. Chu also insisted on bringing in a screenwriter of Asian descent Adele Lim to revise the original script. I'm not saying they know Asia/Singapore, but you have to give them props for trying.In Singapore Social, if you take time to scroll through the credits (that is if you've lasted long enough), you will be hard pressed to find Singaporean names, especially amongst the first few ""executive"" roles. Instead, the guys who took care of transportation must be undeniably Asian/Singaporean (really, go look!).When will we learn that we ourselves must tell our own stories? I'm sure you will find quality production houses a plenty in Singapore (but none of them would probably try to sell a whitewashed wannabe Singapore as a pitch).All it takes is one small slip from an ignorant party (Love Productions USA, I'm looking at you) and the validation of several others who don't know better (um Netflix?) to undermine years of progress in making Asians feel like there's something relatable for them on the screens of international TV.To be fair, I might have an uneducated opinion - after all, I am writing this review having watched only one single episode in the series.I simply saw no point in wasting an additional seven good hours of my life."
tt11194508,"When the media wants something to look a certain way, it will show it in that way, and completely miss the point. According to Singapore Social, Singapore youngsters are all millennial Western wannabes, moaning about their ""traditional Asian parents"", even though their parents were all born in the late 80s.""Why get a diploma?"" ""I confront that school of thought."" ""Hashtag Asian parents.""I teach higher education in Singapore, and I don't see any of these characters. Ignorant and self-obsessed.""You look Thai.""
""I don't know whether to take that as a compliment or not.""""Maybe sometime in 2019, I'll work on communication with my mom. That's not going to happen.""""Sukki's questioning how I'm such a rebel"" (for getting an inside lip tattoo).Singapore is not like this. I just hope these inane empty-heads aren't taken as role models by the thousands of youngsters trying to find their own way in an increasingly hard world.And even without the Singapore context, this is painful watching.Just awful."
tt11194508,"Where do I even begin? Horrible dialogue, jokes, premise and the consistent vapid ramblings from people so detached from the average Singaporean life they wouldn't know what a kopitiam or mama shop looks like. This show should be a test for those trying to deal with secondhand embarrassment."
tt11194508,"I just got done watching all 8 episodes and it's not that bad or it's not even bad at all. I don't understand why people who watched only the trailer and said oh, I don't like this continued to further rant on something they never wanted to watch in the first place, just don't WATCH the show. Now to the review I saw some people think it is trashy it's NOT.To be honest it's just about well to do young people in Singapore that face problems with family/relationships and they are trying to figure out their next step in life and hanging out with their friends. Yes, it's a bit cringe and corny at times but it's a fun watch, that's all. Watch it when you have nothing to do or your waiting for your favorite tv show to come back on.If you take this show so serious you have never watched reality tv, take it with a grain of salt and keep it pushing. If your upset with the casting don't give this show any clout by talking bad about a show you want cancelled it's contradicting. Also the cast weren't awful people nor were they trash because if they were considered that a reality show with REAL TRASHY PEOPLE would be a bit more pleasant.
P.s. if you hate people that are doing financial well I guess this show is not for you."
tt11194508,"Utterly tedious, give it a wide berth.
The dialog is ridiculously phoney and feels forced. Throwing a few four letter words into a discussion doesn't make it any more watchable or trendy. What where the producers of this garbage thinking?"
tt11194508,I'm surprised to see so many negative comments and so many people butthurt because of the title. I found this show silly but nicely shot and entertaining. Just some easy and mindless entertainment.
tt11194508,"I've never watched a show where I straight up cringed at every scene.There's absolutely no plot or storyline, obviously scripted dramas along the way. Seems to emulate the 'Crazy Rich Asians' theme but in poor taste.Not sure how they came up with the title since it definitely doesn't offer any glimpse into the scene in Singapore. Whoever who did the casting did an awful job - picking Mae, a trust fund baby who's only talent seems to be partying and complaining about her first world problems. Tabitha and Sukki were rather bland. What's weird is how they picked Paul, a 50 year old pan asian man to fit into this clique."
tt11194508,It's interesting to see how others live. Don't take this series too seriously. Easy watch.
tt11194508,Totally obsessed with this show.. they better make a season two!!
tt11194508,"These pretentious and self-entitled young ""Singaporeans"" don't even come close to representing the average Singaporean one bit. Most of us don't even talk like this, act like this, and share the same values as them. Please don't get me wrong, I'm in no position to judge them nor their values, I'm just saying that the title is extremely misleading which if you're not a Singaporean should definitely only take with a pinch of salt. I don't blame the youngsters but the producers/director for this disaster of a show."
tt11194508,"I don't think my review will be different from the others so I'll keep it brief. What a bunch of lost, young individuals. Especially when they get all deep and meaningful, I hope other young people don't take it seriously-- it's their expression, not advice."
tt11194508,Is this Singapore's version of Jersey Shore? I somehow managed to get through 25 minutes of this absolute garbage.Thankfully I'm yet to ever come across anyone in Singapore remotely close to these people.This should be pulled off Netflix now! People shouldn't think this is reality and switch to anything else.I challenge someone to get through the entire series without wanting to throw up
tt11194508,"I'm an outsider, never lived in Singapore, have worked with a couple of Singaporeans, and I'm surprised to see so many harsh comments on this TV series. For me, it's an entertaining watch. I don't think it represents the majority of Singapore as the characters feel the burden of being an outcast or an inbetween. These people are out-going, it is so real that you're troubled when you stand between cultures and prejudices. Perhaps it's the headline that leaves a mis-leading message.Now, after watching a few more episodes, I'm finally tired of the drama that we already get from the few first episodes."
tt11194508,"Poorly produced joke of a show - trying to hard to copy The Hills reality tv format, but missing the mark by a long-shot. None of the characters portrayed show any real personality - instead they are all cashed-up, binge drinking millennials who prance around sprouting scripted lines with their trendy hairstyles. There's no heart or soul to the social situations or characters portrayed. Is this a peek into Singapore life? No. Unless you're into aerial shots of the cityscape by night... there's nothing that you can get out of watching this tryhard garbage....it's the wealthy 1% with their rich parents, who have no real problems, fake accents, even faker social connections, stand for nothing and amount to nothing. An utter waste of time."
tt11194508,"Netflix I hate you for this, I really do. I hate everything about this show. The actors, the cast behind the scene, the director, the person that pitch this idea to Netflix and the dumbo at Netflix that gave this project the green light."
tt11194508,"I hate to say I have a favorite but Sukki is freaking awesome. However, I do believe if you enjoy reality shows that actually give entertainment and realness this is the show for you"
tt11194508,"I found it really weird that after hearing so many negative comments online, i find 20+ 10/10 reviews in a row. Oh no what did i miss? A fresh new perspective? How about no.I cant believe NF was willing to invest in trolls to pump the rating. CHECK OUT all the 10/10 ratings. ALL CREATED ON 21st December. How budget can you get? At least pay more for trolls with different creation dates and some reviews of other titles. Man, what amateurs. But again i don't blame NF, their originals are usually fantastic, probably not used to doing stuff like this.How bout we just call this ""Social"", set in Singapore."
tt11194508,"Major cringe fest. Trying too hard. The money into the production can be used to make a lot of good quality Indie films..
I didn't make it through the first episode. KUWTK is way better. (Can you imagine that?)"
tt11194508,"I just hope Singapore is nothing like the series.
Everything in the series is so pretentious and off the track of the genuine humanity culture of a place."
tt11194508,I managed to finish the first and last episodes with nothing in between. This is nothing but a Singapore Tourism Board advertisement at best. The rest is trash.
tt11194508,"This is one of the hardest things I've ever watched, every scene and conversation had me cringing"
tt11874042,Wasati is the golden bag of them all. A total loss for Netflix.
tt11874042,"Im sorry guys, but this is bellow your professional level of directing and filming.And Meshal aljasir... Are you a psycho?"
tt11874042,Very good directingToo mysterious + very bad endings
tt11874042,Trash garbage and waste of time ...... just dont watch it
tt11874042,Very disappointed. It only shows their skills in production and that's it.
tt11874042,"Ideology all over the place, never forget that you are a punch of clowns."
tt11874042,"It seems like only recently that westerners have been able to see films shot in Saudi Arabia or by Saudi directors (e.g., Haifaa al-Mansour's brilliant Wadjda). This series of several shorts is one of them. The offerings are absurdist, and without the cultural background to evaluate them, I get the feeling that I missed a lot. But they're entertaining and some are quite brilliant."
tt11874042,"I absolutely find this series refreshing. Some scene may be provocative I must say, but it certainly is interesting. The storylines are also out of the box. The production and the way these short stories are shot in a very artistic angles, so I suppose it is not for everyone's liking. As a foreigner, who is always curious about new culture, this series offer me a glimpse to the new and young contemporary art scenes of Saudi. I Love it! Not giving it 10 stars because not all stories are that interesting."
tt11874042,"I can summarize my review in one word, DISAPPOINTED ."
tt11874042,"If you're not Arab, probably you won't like it. It's discuss a Saudi culture things that you won't interested into or it won't touch you basically"
tt11874042,"I thoroughly enjoyed this mini series of films. The storytelling, camera angles, and overall themes of some the short films were quite good.One of them even managed to make me tear up because of the event that happens in it, and there was some that left me thinking ""Wait, no, that can't be it, it couldn't have ended like that"".But despite the 4 good short films, there were 2 others that weren't as good (Rat and one which involves a character named Sumyati).For one of them (Rat) I didn't understand the story, maybe because there is a deeper meaning there which I haven't yet grasped, as for the other one, it just felt off to me and I didn't really like it because of the pacing and another thing which I can't quite out my finger on."
tt11874042,"The worst thing I've seen this year.
What a waste of money and energy"
tt11874042,Actually I respect they trying but it's not good enough to be in Netflix..The idea is very superficial and one of the actors in the film says that the audience does not understand the idea..this is a sufficient reason to give this work one star..and I do not wish to see similar works on international platforms.
tt11874042,The worst TV series ever. Waste of time Do not watch it.
tt11874042,"A real time waster, totally pointless.
It was then justified to be directed only to critics not to us.Ps. A good movie/TV series shows up itself, stop asking others to raise the rating lol."
tt11874042,This is so bad to the point that i want to kill my self for spending 10 min of my life watching this
tt11874042,"Too many reviews written in exactly the same language and not saying much except for the movies being bad and the need to be on youtube rather then on netflix.I didn't watch it all but some. I honestly saw all the awful reviews and had to check what made such awful impression on people. I found what I watched interesting and the parts I didn't understand made me curious. I think it's as the title says, windows to another culture. I saw not one movie done in the middle east and let me tell you, some are pure garbage. I didn't think that way about what I saw here."
tt11874042,"Bad acting , bad stories , bad cast
Im sorry for myself to watch this .."
tt11874042,"I liked the cinematography in all the episodes, the music choices and the casting was very good, having a set of episodes that were directed by different people every time was an advantage and a disadvantage at the same time , you like one episode and you want more but something different comes your way, it definitely takes you for a different style every episode but some people aren't going to be happy with it ... there is a sense of social responsibility in some episodes and then it's a sense of we don't care about society in other episodes but overall it wasn't a total waste of time you should definitely give it a chance if you have the time , it's better than I thought"
tt11874042,"Some of the artists have a bad personality, and the story not interesting and if we are going to talk about how they are actresses this is funny because no one of them is good so don't waste your time in a bad movie if i can but -10 star i will do it"
tt11874042,"Being a fan of BBC style documentaries and dramas; very little ever excites my senses. This definitely measures up to be of such superior quality and content!If anyone ever watched 'Inside Number 9', they are comparable! However what makes this even BETTER is how artistic and how beautifully this was shot.Every frame is immaculately planned, perfectly positioned, with perfect contrasts and lighting. Everything thematic; for e.g. the bedsheet which Sumiyati lies in is so vivid compared to everything around it which I found unnerving!It aims to take the viewer on a emotional rollercoaster; which it has achieved well. However what makes this REALLY special is what this is trying to tell the rest of the work about Saudi Arabia.Firstly, the characters are relate-able; they are humanised to us irrespective of time or space; then they show us the issue they are portraying. They have successfully portrayed 3 main aspects of Saudi society:
1) Ultra conservative religious right; who still to this day gets uncomfortable with the idea of a woman travelling in a bus with 4 men! It's crazy but a FACT in KSA.
2) Educated, globalised, cultural and modern centrists (to slightly liberal)which is a good majority of the population (probably 50%).
3) the FAR LEFT; whom until this film I never realised existed to this level.The third type has not been portrayed at all; however the mindset and thought processes required proved that the producers, directors and writers had to be!Maids are abused to NO end, but no one talks about it; now we have a whole short film on focusing on issues that transcends Saudi Arabia; but how usually the rich treat the poor in all developing countries.No, NONE of the stories follow some strong storyline which is gripping...this is more of a feast for your eyes and ears. You make what you want it to be; pleasantly surprised, never thought Saudi film makers are al ready there.To all the 1 liner, ""film no good"" reviews, or complaining about the absence of love and betrayal or dancing in the rain...I say go and keep watching Bollywood movies this is not meant for you.The issue I found is; there aren't many people in Saudi that would enjoy this; because most of us are of the country 😂. This give me hope that one day I will return and many of my liberal friends will too!Kudos! MashAllah! Bellessimo! Onward and upwards! Fantastic job!"
tt11874042,Finally a saudi film that fairly represents the actually events that happens in Saudi in a creative way
tt11874042,It's bad series save your time and watch something else
tt11874042,So bad movie .. it's the worst movie I've ever seen .. i don't recommend ..
tt0117765,"for those of you who don't know (and I'm sure there's a lot of you) Strip Tease was actually a book written by Carl Hiaasen, and a damn good book at that. Brilliant characters, an intriguing storyline, hilarious incidents, sex, violence, the works...I gave the movie a 5 because Robert Patrick and Burt Reynolds were absolutely hysterical and on-point (I'm sure THEY actually READ the book), but aside from those two gems this movie was a disgrace.What happened to the plot?!? What happened to like half the story?!? What happened to my self respect?!? Why change the ending?!? The story was enthralling and thoroughly enjoyable when I read the book, the movie (breasts considered) not so much..There's a gratuitous 3 minute topless dancing scene, followed by 3 minutes of Demi and the little girl crying and being superdramatic. CHOOSE which audience you're marketing this movie towards! Women won't respect a nonsense T&A fest and men don't want to see a bunch of sappy overdramatics when the movie was advertised like a softcore porno flick.The fact that a BOOK about strippers was exponentially better than the movie.. that's saying something.Anonymous Disgrunted Hiaasen Fan"
tt0117765,"...the flop that deserves six of its Razzies and the nomination for Worst Picture of the Decade?I think, ""Striptease"" (1996) directed by Andrew Bergman based on the book by Carl Hiaasen, is all of the above - a curious mixture of laughs, satire, absurdism, darkness, silliness, and over-seriousness. The latter comes from Demi Moore who plays Erin Grant, the FBI secretary - losing her job and the custody over her daughter to no good small time crook wheelchairs stealing husband (Robert Patrick looking and acting like a stoned, redneck version of Gary Oldman) and who takes a job as an exotic dancer in the local club ""Eager Beaver"" to earn money for her court appeal. In the club she becomes the hottest attraction and meets many...interesting characters, the most colorful being, of course Congressman David Dilbeck (Burt Reynolds) who ""just loves naked women. It's a character flaw"" and who is absolutely smitten by Erin. Erin also makes friends with a club bouncer, Shad (Ving Rhames) who is perhaps the best thing in the movie - clever, sharp, sarcastic, with the great sense of humor. One scene where Shad tells to Dilbeck's bodyguards that Meryl Streep used to work in ""Eager Beaver"" as an exotic dancer and they seem to believe him is brilliant. If only everything had been as good as he was we would've had a really great movie. What do we have now? Well, Demi Moore looks really good with the minimum clothes on. I mean, the woman was a 33 year old mother of three at the time and her body was marvel to behold. I just think that she was too serious, intense, and solemn doing the striptease numbers  after all it is not only strip it is tease, too. It goes to her acting in the movie in general. Reynolds seemed to have a lot of fun with his sleazy drunk Congressman David Dilbeck, election-day choice of Christian groups and a lot of laughs comes from his mannerism and quotes. There are plenty of laughs, actually, in ""Striptease"" but quite often they seem like the wrong and unintentional type for the movie material. Who had the best laugh? I'd guess, Demi Moore did after been paid $12.5 million  one of the highest paychecks for an actress back then."
tt0117765,"Demi Moore reinvented herself from a hot cutsie girl in the 80's to a powerful sexy woman in the 90's. She used that power to create some pretty dynamic roles at the time, G.I Jane being her best effort.Striptease is not the greatest movie but it does have enough highlights to make it an ok watch. Rhames is enjoyable as is Reynolds.Moore however owns the screen on this one. She had power at this time and she knew it and was happy to wield it. Good for her."
tt0117765,"I read the book first and I can only say that I feel sorry for its author, Carl Hiassen.  The book was an extremely funny satire of capitalism, politics, gender roles, etc. and the film was just an excuse for the lead actor to show off her surgically enhanced body.  I mentioned the book in a university tutorial for my course on literary satire, and no one would believe me that it was not trash because they could not separate it from the movie which followed it. Too bad - the book is good enough to have warranted a script that stays true to the original story rather than exchange wit and sophistication for extended dance sequences and the lubricatory possibilities of yogurt."
tt0117765,"The summary line above came from my wife after seeing Andrew Bergman take a really funny book by Carl Hiaasen and turn it into a ""Sincere Sally Field Gutsy Mom Works As A Stripper Even Though It Means Shame And Disgust Because It's For Her *Daughter*!!!"" movie.Ving Rhames and Burt Reynolds deliver deft, wonderful performances that are completely sunk by Demi Moore's Jawline Of Grim Determination.  The book pointed out that the ones degraded by stripping are actually the men, who turn into drooling, brainless fools, while the women have the control and collect the money.  The movie has to add a scene where the daughter sees the mother dancing (oh horrors!) and the mother has to explain her Sordid Living to the Innocent Babe.Also, in the book, Erin is a top dancer who doesn't have the biggest boobs in the room, but who gets the best tips because she actually knows how to dance.  So who do they get to play her?  Bebe Neuwirth?  Noooo.  Demi Moore. All tits and no dancing talent.Demi Moore was apparently determined to keep this movie from being seen as a comedy.  The worst thing to say about this movie is that she succeeded completely."
tt0117765,"StripteaseDire, but strangely fascinating, Demi Moore vehicle about a single mother who turns to a life of stripping in order to gain custody of her daughter. (Robert Patrick is the drug-stealing ex-husband who gains custody of the child.) Ving Rhames is a bodyguard and Burt Reynolds has a nice co-star role as a sleazy political candidate. This movie was extremely bashed when it came out, but it's better than ""Showgirls,"" and sort of watchable. If you don't expect much of a story, then this is for you...be warned, however, that there is  a lot of stripteasing in this film.** / *****"
tt0117765,"Shabby comedy-drama from Carl Hiaasen's novel has former-FBI clerk Demi Moore turning to stripping at the Eager Beaver in order to pay off her legal debts; seems she's in a fight to retrieve her child from her ex, yet the film doesn't see stripping as disreputable, thereby presenting Moore's Erin Grant as a hard-working heroine with a heart of gold for us to sympathize with. Director Andrew Bergman may have helmed this project blindfolded, how else to explain the sketchily-drawn characters, the ridiculous strip-club sequences or a dire subplot involving Congressman Burt Reynolds? Solid supporting turns by Armand Assante as a cop and Ving Rhames as a bouncer give the film its only validity. As for Moore, she isn't a bad actress, nor is she a stupid one, but the $12 million she acquired for her non-performance here seems like a joke on the audience--and on Hollywood. * from ****"
tt0117765,"This film begins with a woman named ""Erin Grant"" (Demi Moore) arguing for custody of her young daughter before a judge. Unfortunately, the judge rules against her because of her current occupation as a stripper even though she has explained to him that she was fired due to her husband's criminal misconduct. Not long afterward, while performing her routine at the stripclub, a brawl occurs involving a person who just happens to be a morally flawed United States Congressman named ""David Dilbeck"" (Burt Reynolds). Yet, even though he was wearing a disguise to hide his true identity, he is still recognized by a couple of people. And this creates a huge problem for them as Congressman Dilbeck has surrounded himself with people who are intent on keeping him in power and are willing to take whatever measures are necessary to keep his reputation intact. And their ruthlessness becomes even more pronounced as his lust for Erin increases-with those able to identify him becoming prime targets. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an extremely uneven film due in large part to the ambivalent direction, meandering plot and horrific acting of Burt Reynolds. On the other side of the equation, I liked the performances of Ving Rhames (as the bouncer named ""Shad"") and the aforementioned Demi Moore who I thought was absolutely sensational. That being said, in spite of the rather obvious flaws, I still liked this movie to a certain degree and I have rated it accordingly. Average."
tt0117765,"Some people take both life and cinema far too seriously . Look at STRIPTEASE for example . The opening scene takes place in a court where Erin Grant is fighting for custody of her child against her husband Darell who has a serious problem with drugs . The judge decides that because Erin is unemployed pill popping Darell should get the kid ! Erin realises that the only way to get the kid back is if she gets a job as a stripper at The Eager Beaver nightclub and on her first night there she blows away the opposition . Got that a woman who has never stripped before is miles better than than the old pros who have been doing their dance routine for years . In fact she's so good Congressman Dilbeck feels duty bound to save her from a punter by hitting a drunken punter over the head with a champagne bottle . Hmm so you've got a senior politician who frequents The Eager Beaver nightclub which obviously doesn't harm his career prospects and assaults a fellow patron andnobody calls the press ! That's just the start of the movie ( And it gets more and more incredible as it goes along as if you hadn't noticed ) but people come on to this site to say what a terrible movie it is ! Thanks for pointing this out but it's not actually supposed to be a great movie is it ? It's done tongue in cheek with Burt Reynolds giving a career worst performance as Congressman Dilbeck . This alone would have made it watchable enough without Demi Moore flashing her silicon enhanced breasts around at every opportunity . If you think this is a serious movie then perhaps Ving Rhames role as Shad is a knowingly ironic character: "" No it's a f--kin' shrimp . Course it's a roach "" which is a clever way of explaining to the less clued up audience members that it's not a shrimp , a roach or a turkey - It's a tongue in cheek movie"
tt0117765,"It may not have mirrored the book, but it has its own charm. I haven't read the book, so maybe that's why I can judge the movie on its own merits.Ving Rhames is terrific-- honestly, has he ever had a clunker of a performance? Demi is luscious (the dance scenes, and the cute scene where she's getting dressed/dancing after a shower), and Burt Reynolds is hilarious. I really loved the congressman character meeting the right wing group slathered in vaseline. ""Fresh, hot, lint!"" indeed! Give it a whirl... it ain't Citizen Kane, but it ain't Battlefield Earth either."
tt0117765,"In Florida, the FBI secretary Erin Grant (Demi Moore) loses her job because of the arrest record of her scum husband Darrell Grant (Robert Patrick). Immediately after, she loses the custody of her seven-year-old daughter Angela (Rumer Willis) since she is unemployed, and Darell is a C. I. of the police. Now she needs to raise fifteen thousand dollars to appeal by a court of higher instance to retrieve Angela and becomes a stripper at the Eager Beaver strip-club. Meanwhile, Darrell uses Angela to steal wheelchair from hospitals to sell them later. At the club, Erin is worshiped by her fans and is well treated by her fellow strippers and colleagues, including the bouncer Shad (Ving Rhames) that protects her. When Congressman David Dilbeck (Burt Reynolds) goes to the club, he has a crush on Erin and hits a daring client that invaded her stage with a bottle of champagne. He is recognized by her fan Jerry Killian (William Hill) that promises Erin to use this information to force Dilbeck to help her to retrieve the custody of Angela. However, Dilbeck is the chairman of the sugar committee and is connected to powerful and dangerous people in Florida related to sugar business that protect his image. Soon Miami P. D, Lt. Al Garcia (Armand Assante), who is on vacation with his wife nearby a lake, finds Jerry's body and interviews Erin, since Jerry's house is full of photos of Erin, and she explains that he was trying to help her. When the Lawyer Alan Mordecai (Stuart Pankin) gets the photos of Dilbeck in the club, he decides to blackmail the congressman. Soon his body is found, and Lt. Garcia believes Erin is in danger, but she needs money and has to continue working as a stripper.Despite the great cast and soundtrack, ""Striptease"" (1996) is a disappointing movie. The plot is lost among several genres and none of them works well. The comedy is unfunny, the thriller is silly, and the drama is shallow. Names like Armand Assante, Ving Rhames, Robert Patrick, Paul Guilfoyle and Burt Reynolds are wasted in a poor screenplay. Demi Moore's face is still very beautiful, but her excessively buff body with silicone lost the femininity. Therefore, her nude is disappointing. The soundtrack with Annie Lennox among others is the plus in this forgettable movie. I revisited ""Striptease"" yesterday to see whether it has improved after almost thirty years, but unfortunately it has not. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Striptease"""
tt0117765,"This is a very misunderstood film. It's not some sleaze erotic thriller but a comedy drama. It can be off putting when you go from joke to a serious part of the story, and there might be a little too much stripping but it's not that bad. The story has murder mystery and and full belly laughs and a few terrific one liners. If it was made by the Coens everyone would call it a masterpiece. You shouldn't watch this film expecting something serious, just go with it and see how much fun you have. Burt Reynolds gives the performance of his career, Ving Rhames as good as ever, and there's Robert Patrick playing a loser so with out morals he steals wheelchairs for a living. Films like this, that are neither one thing or the other, are always uneven. But the director/writer manages to pull it off. It could be better but it could have been a whole lot worse."
tt0117765,"Striptease (1996) is a movie that I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows a mother going through a divorce who loses visitation of her daughter due to a lack of steady income. She becomes a stripper to build the security she needs to get her daughter back and establish herself. The stripper life will throw her a series of twists and turns.This movie is directed by Andrew Bergman (It Could Happen to You) and stars Demi Moore (Ghost), Burt Reynolds (Deliverance), Ving Rhames (Pulp Fiction), Robert Patrick (Terminator 2), Paul Guilfoyle (Airforce One) and Armand Assante (Gotti).This has an absolutely awesome cast that was well selected and fit the storyline perfectly. The strippers were gorgeous. Burt Reynolds was hilarious, and the Vaseline scene is legendary. There's some good humor throughout the movie as Ving Rhames was fantastic and the anaconda scene always makes me crack up. The soundtrack was solid also. The storyline was fairly straightforward but did a great job of depicting strippers as ordinary people with ordinary problems.Overall, this gets way more criticism than it should. This is entertaining and worth a watch. I would score this a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once."
tt0117765,"I am a big Carl Hiaasen fan and, while this may not be his best work, it certainly exposes the flaws in Florida politics for all the world to see. While certain environmentalists are celebrating Governor Charlie's transfer of $1.7 billion to Big Sugar, you can see in this film, even in a comical way, how they have out congressmen in the bag.Demi has come up against DCF and has to do anything to get her children back. Unfortunately, she has come into the clutches of Congressman Burt and his evil henchmen. I really didn't think her performance was all that terrible, and I certainly appreciated the new work she had on display in a very skintastic moment, just as I appreciated seeing the lovely Pandora Peaks, Rina Riffel (Candyman 3), another skintastic performance by Dina Spybey, and that snakey performance of Barbara Alyn Woods. Let's hear it for all the fine performance that took our attention away from, well, I guess there wasn't much else.Ving Rhames was good as usual, and I did enjoy Armand Assante. But, that aside, it was the performance on stage that really stand out."
tt0117765,"The novel ""Striptease"" was everything you could ask for in a novel.  The movie is the complete opposite and a major disappointment for me.  I thought Demi was a decent choice and also applauded the casting of Robert Patrick as her good-for-nothing ex, and Ving Rhames as a bodyguard at the club.However the entire thing ended up being a mess, and I can only hope I can erase the image of Burt Reynolds in his boxers, smothered with petroleum jelly from head to toe, from my mind.Read the book!!"
tt0117765,"The poster is attractive, and Demi Moore has definitely had dancing lessons in how to gyrate in strip dancing. It is not a real world, but her performance is believable. Even Ving Rhymes looks as though he can act in this film. Her estranged husband is despicable, but his performance is good. The detective also put in a good performance, but you weren't sure if he was one of those seedy characters that frequent a strip club. Burt Reynolds was just himself. I had no sympathy for Moore's character. She is prepared to dance for $2,000 and $5,000 respectively. Just how far would you go just to earn money? The film ends up being a comedy because it just cannot be taken seriously. Only the performances make this film commendable."
tt0117765,"This soft-core glossy skin flick (which is what it is, if you're honest about it) actually was better than I anticipated. the story was interesting all the way through, featured some great female bodies of course, but had decent acting and photography. The nudity involved breasts, nothing else and there was no sex. Demi Moore looked awesome at times; too tough-looking at other times.Robert Patrick and Burt Reynolds played over-the-top characters who got a bit annoying after awhile. Reynolds is particularly sleazy and they use him in this film to denigrate elected officials and people who speak out for ""family values."" Hollywood loves to trash the latter, having no values of its own. They also trash Republicans and a group called ""Young Christians,"" just more typical cheap shots of the Libeal film-making industry. They are unrelenting.The only likable character in the movie is played by Armand Assante, although the film makes you root for Moore in her custody case.I understand the book is much. Gosh, that's a surprise!"
tt0117765,"I have considered this long and hard, but can honestly conclude that I have never seen a worst film than this. Most films in ""worst films"" lists are low budget films that were rushed B movies that turned into D movies. But Striptease has no excuses. The story is taken from a good book and made into the worst script I have ever heard. Of course, the acting, direction and script are all bad, but with Striptease they are so consistently awful throughout the film that it really defies belief.And don't even mention Demi making her character such a mindnumbingly clichéd ""doing it for the kids"" mom! Starpower at its worst? Nothing can beat this."
tt0117765,"Two amazing things about this movie; no, make that three:(1) That Carl Hiaasen actually liked the adaptation of his hilarious novel.  Hiaasen is still one of the funniest writers around(if you read STRIPTEASE and liked it, I highly recommend all of the other novels he wrote by himself), but this proves his taste is questionable.  This movie, unlike the novel, is painfully unfunny.  There are occasional good lines from the novel(like when Ving Rhames(the only good actor here, along with Demi Moore's daughter Rumer Willis) telling two security guards that Meryl Streep used to strip under the name Chesty LeFrance), and even a couple of original ones(like Moore refusing to dance with cream corn because she doesn't want it to go up her ""hoo-ha""), but the motivations, the characters, and the story are all hacked away; (2) that Andrew Bergman is responsible for this mess.  After all, from his track record as writer(THE IN-LAWS, FLETCH, co-writer of SOAPDISH) and director(THE FRESHMAN, HONEYMOON IN VEGAS(both of which he also wrote), IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU), you'd think this was someone who knows funny.  But he goes so wrong here it's unbelievable.  Typical is the scene where Burt Reynolds character, who we know is a lech, delivers a sermon on ""family values.""  Did Bergman think he was actually breaking new ground here? Contrast that to a similar scene in the book, where we hear(though don't see) his character deliver an off-the-cuff speech on Israel which works precisely because he's feeling horny.  This is funny.  What's in the movie isn't; (3) That Demi Moore keeps appearing in novel adaptations when she apparently doesn't understand what made the source work.  This is the third novel adaptation(THE SCARLET LETTER, THE JUROR) in a row she appeared in, and they were all awful adaptations of fine books.  Okay, I'm not a big fan of hers, but she's done good work(G.I. JANE, IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK), and this isn't it."
tt0117765,"Hey, come on, guys - where's your sense of humor??  The movie is based on a book by Carl Hiassen, the master of comedy/thrillers set in southern Florida.  Demi Moore, Burt Reynolds and especially Ving Rhames bring the characters to life, and then some!  Doesn't seem realistic?  Have you seen John Sayles' ""Sunshine State""?  This is how the ""other half"" lives, believe it or not... And even not, it's a very funny film.  Demi deserves a lot of credit for taking on this quite challenging role.  She's got a great body, and more power to her!! May the best woman win!!  And she does!!!In addition, Burt Reynolds once again proves that he has a marvelous sense of comedy timing, character creation, and isn't afraid to make a fool of himself.  And Ving...., he's just marvelous. For a good time, rent ""Striptease"".  And bring along your friends."
tt0117765,"Different people watching this film see different movies. T and A people see naked and think great. The rest see this as crap. Except for Carl Hiaasen fans. I'm one of the latter and since I've read the book I can't help but see this as an attack on political corruption and environmental folly.After losing her job as an office clerk for the FBI due to her ex-husbands recent criminal proclivities, Erin Grant (Demi Moore) resorts to stripping to support herself and her daughter as well as the high legal fees of a custody battle with said ex. When a corrupt congressman takes a lewd interest in Erin, she is drawn into a profitable but dangerous situation involving Florida sugar growers.Become a Carl Hiaasen fan and see this movie for what it really is and delegate the stripper bar to just the setting, much as a spaceship is in a sci-fi movie. It's not a great movie, but when can see the content rather than the package, it is worth far more than a 4.3. Burt Reynolds character is worth much more than that. It deserves a 5 or so. I give it a 6 just for Hiaasen."
tt0117765,It is a good movie. It is not a great movie. It did not have great writing. It has okay writing. It has great acting. And some very pretty women in it. It is okay.
tt0110657,"This is one of those harmless sequels that seems to draw unnecessary ire. This is a ""rip-off"" sequel, but the cast plays it well, and it's true to its formula.  Michael Ironside is a fine villain.  And Hillary Swank, who went on to win a Best Actress Oscar, shows sparkle and potential in the lead. There are many worse movies to rent to watch with your niece.  My score -- 6/10."
tt0110657,"I really didn't think The Next Karate Kid was THAT bad. Flawed yes, but it is not terrible I don't think.As I have said, the film does have its flaws. The story is quite predictable and formulaic, though in its defence, the story wasn't necessarily a strong point in the previous three either. Second, the script has its weak spots, it did have its moments such as with Miyagi's humour. Third, there are some unrealistic moments here, the ending especially. Fourth, it isn't as efficiently paced as the first or third films.However, it is nicely filmed, the cinematography is good and the scenery is very nice. The soundtrack is pleasant, and the karate is good. The direction is good enough, and the characters are still at least engaging. The acting is decent, Hilary Swank is a worthy replacement for Ralph Macchio, while Pat Morita elevates this movie to a better level acting who is arguably the best character of the film and giving a strong performance in the process.Overall, it was pretty decent, and better than its reputation. It could have been better, but I have seen much worse movies. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0110657,"When I first saw this movie it was playing on TV. I almost didn't watch it because really could it be any better than the original. I decided to give it a try anyways. After watching it, I really enjoyed it. It was really cheesy but other parts were enjoyable and funny.Miyagi is great as usual, which is the main reason I even bothered to watch the movie in the first place. I've always loved his character. This movie is worth at least a one-time viewing if you really liked the Karate Kid movies. It's fine for what it is. It's not the greatest movie in the world but definitely something you could enjoy on a nice rainy day with the kids.Hillary Swank did a pretty good job too. This movie brought Hillary to the forefront and was a good jumping off point. She did the best she could with a not so great plot."
tt0110657,"I thought this movie was going to be a disgrace to the series. After all, part 3 didn't measure up to part 2, and this one doesn't have Daniel Sawn. Miyagi's humour wasn't quite as witty in this one as in part 3, but it was funny enough to make the movie worth watching.The girl's part was pretty good. She's a lost teenager who needs direction. I find the plot a little hard to believe. That the aunt would simply agree to leave her home and her niece under the care of Mr. Miyagi, a man she just met. Of course, he was a friend of her brother.I did appreciate the monastery. One might think from some of my other reviews that I wouldn't have liked the dancing monks, but I thought it was amusing. It showed that they know how to have some fun. Now if these were monks in ancient China dancing to pop-music, that would have been another matter.Probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks wouldn't kill a bug. Miyagi told her that street gangs killing each other is stupid, nations trying to destroy each other is stupid, but having respect for all life is not stupid. Miyagi has expressed such wisdom in the other films as well.I give this movie a 4 out of 10. Sure, there were some things I liked about it. It wasn't as funny as part three, and no character could ever live up to Sato in part 2. This movie has no re-watch value. I can't imagine watching it again, but it is worth seeing once."
tt0110657,"Strange, utterly needless sequel has Pat Morita returning one last time as Mr. Miyagi. Set several years after Part III, Daniel is off on his own, leaving Miyagi free to instruct another troubled teenager, this time a woman, played by Hillary Swank, who is the granddaughter of his old commanding officer, who is being terrorized in her school by(you guessed it!) bullying martial arts/military cadet students(led by the dependable Michael Ironside) Plot is utterly predictable and uninspired; Miyagi's story was tied to Daniel's so having him instruct this girl is incongruous; it just didn't involve the viewer. Though not as silly as Part III, this is still not credible either, and marks an unfitting end to a story best left alone."
tt0110657,"I cant believe that some people gave this such high marks! First off, I have a hard time believing that this group of thugs would be allowed to go around tormenting students, and sexually harassing girls. The principal OVERHEARS the head thug bullying Julie into meeting him ""at the docks...most girls have to BEG me for an invitation, and you're turning Me down?!?!"" Yet, even though he OVERHEARS this and SEES the girl trying to pull herself away from this dork, the Principal STILL sends HER to the office?!? Yea, right. You cant tell me she is the FIRST girl he has tormented, and you cant tell me that no girls went home and told their parents.It appears that the football coach (?) has his own private gang/ army and he allows them, encourages even, to torture others. He says ""If a student throws a piece of paper on the floor, you make them eat it"" Yea, RIGHT! This gang walks the halls together, dressed like a bunch of 1950 throw-back thugs, in their tight jeans and tight, matching black t-shirts, and black leather belts. GET REAL! And apparently, they also have the right to wander the halls of the school in the middle of the night. No parent would put up with this crap going on in their child's school. If MY kid came home, told me this crap was going on, you can bet Id be on the phone with state superintendent.The coach (?) beats up his students outside, on the field, in broad daylight. This is okay? My FAVORITE, though, was the coach telling his ""gang"" to blow up that dudes car.This whole thing was a joke. The thug busts out the guys windows on prom night and says ""MEET ME AT THE DOCKS"" OK, see, Id go inside Julies house, pick up the phone, call the cops and SAY"" Some crazy dude in a jeep just busted out my windows and told me to meet him at the docks if I was brave enough"" Then, let the cops go to the docks and find his jeep, and arrest his butt. This movie was just lame."
tt0110657,"""The Next Karate Kid"" is not a very impressive film.  However, it introduces a young actress named Hilary Swank to the mainstream audience.  Amazingly, just five short years after this film Swank would be holding the Oscar for her gender-bending role in ""Boys Don't Cry"".  In this film she takes Macchio's role and does an admirable job even though the material is just not there.  2.5 out of 5 stars."
tt0110657,"While I totally objected to this chapter ever being made, at least it had a young Hilary Swank (I seem to be her only male fan). While this film was kind of hokie and predictable, at least it accurately portrayed the horrors of men trying to shop for women. Pat Morita's performance in that scene alone was priceless. While this proved to be nothing more than a spin-off grasping at straws, at least no one completely embarrassed themselves. Also, where the heck was Ralph Macchio! Couldn't he have made a guest appearance. It's not like he had anything to do at the time."
tt0110657,"Here is introduced a new kid , girl , with the subsequently two times Oscarized Hilary Swank . This is an entertaining and fun martial arts movie with the intimate Pat Morita (his final appearance as Keisake Miyagi) , and , as always , the show belongs to Noriyuki-Miyagi . The story deals with a troublesome teenager named Julie (a newcomer Hilary Swank) , thanks to Miyagi she learns that Karate is her salvation , as she battles an evil nemesis , facing off a violent young group trained by an expert fighter (Michael Ironside) . Along the way, the Japanese Miyagi (Noriyuki, Pat Morita) born in Okinawa teaches his martial arts and to combat at a Zen temple along with some sympathetic monks . Meanwhile , Julie falls in love with a friendly youngster (Chris Conrad) .This enjoyable movie , a sort of female junior version of 'Rocky' , develops a sincere and deep friendship between two protagonists , the rookie young girl and the wise old man . Using more than her fists , Julie learns about herself and the sense of life . Agreeable and likable acting by main actors : Pat Morita and Hilary Swank . Furthermore , it appears as secondaries , the ordinary baddie : Michael Ironside , and the veteran Constance Towers who formerly worked in various films directed by John Ford . The picture contains adequate cinematography by Laszlo Kovacs and long-standing musical score , though with some disco-music , by composer Bill Conti , trilogy's usual , who composed Rocky saga as well. This feel-good message picture was professionally directed by Christopher Cain , though John G. Avildsen was originally slated to shhot his fourth Karate Kid film , but he dropped out in order to make 8 seconds (1994) . The three previous films , all of them produced by Jerry Weintraub and directed by John G Avildsen , are the following ones : original ¨Karate Kid I (1984¨) in which are presented the classic characters : Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita , ¨Karate Kid II (1986)¨ where the protagonists travel to Okinawa and ¨Karate Kid III (1989)¨ where Daniel again battling nasty enemies . Finally , this ¨The Next Karate Kid (1994)¨, rating : acceptable and passable sequel , worthwhile seeing . This heartwarming will appeal to Karate Kid trilogy fans ."
tt0110657,"This movie is very bad. First of all the acting is awful. I mean the first 3 movies had cheesy acting and some cheesy moments, but this movie has got to have some of the worst acting in film history. The main character played by Hillary Swank is the worst. her expositions and line delivery is so bad and off that it makes the movie hard to watch. Also the villains are horrible as well. The villains in the 3rd movie were bad too but in this movie they are so over the top and unrealistic that you simply can't take them seriously. The evil teacher in this movie played by Michael Ironside is WAY to over the top. They make him straight up evil. Anyways, the movies plot is lame, the acting sucks, the characters are terrible,and the film is unnecessary and pointless. Don't watch this garbage."
tt0110657,"Personally i have seen this movie about half a dozen times.I think it is great.Do not get me wrong,in my humble opinion the original karate kid(1984)with Ralph Macchio was better but Hilary Swank gets the job done nevertheless.An exciting story,a lot of action,a little bit of drama and sentimentality when it was required and exceptional acting;What is not to love?All that hate does not make any sense.Someone who liked the first movie should like this one too and even if you were not a big fan of the first movie you absolutely have to give it a try.Mr Miyagki for once more turns out to be an excellent teacher that every (karate)kid would want to have.This is a must see and it goes in my personal top 25 movies."
tt0110657,"In a few ways this movie isn't too bad, the acting is cheesy but decent enough, the characters are well developed, and good cinematography. But... there is literally no plot, it's just a bunch of random storylines. Not to mention these senior boys look like they're about 30."
tt0110657,On what day did God create Karate Kid 4 and couldnt He have rested on that day too?
tt0110657,"This is a really bad movie. First, it is supposed to follow other parts of Karate Kid with ideas, action and energy. However, the only action we get happens in the last 7 minutes of the movie. Everything else is more a ""drama"" genre, about a spoiled and angry clichéd teenage girl who is all about ""you're ruining my life"" and ""leave me alone"". When Mr. Miyagi says that ""boys are easier"" I would definitely agree that Daniel-san was much more sophisticated and simple. However, this girl is actually a terrible paradigm of a teenage girl. We watch her little arguments, school problems, etc. and poor Miyagi trying to teach her to be as sophisticated as his former student. Had there not been Mr. Miyagi in this movie, it would be a complete disaster. With him, it is a little bit better. The chemistry and energy from the first part completely disappeared in this movie. The girl does not have the charm nor the energy of Daniel-san. Therefore, while I gave the first part a 10, I give this movie a 3. (Without Mr. Miyagi it would be between 1 and 2.)"
tt0110657,"After several referrals from friends and hearing their incessant quoting, I decided to see this film. I grew up with the Macchio movies, but never had the pleasure of watching this train wreck of a movie.We meet Swank's character, and with no regard for subtlety, we learn her story: teenage girl, parents died, mad at life, no respect, looks like a dude. To show her defiance, she sneaks out a lot. Where does she go? That's right. Swank visits an injured hawk on the top of her school building that she feeds raw meat to every other day. Genius.Jester from Top Gun is the Faux Cobra Kai's sensai. It's depressing to watch Michael Ironside's career take a nose dive (get it) with each of his scenes. ""Absolutely."" The FBK is pretty ridiculous. Somehow they get away with trespassing, vandalism, arson, property damage and assault because they are some sort of pseudo-ROTC. And what was with the prom-night bungee-jump scene? The love connection between the two homosexuals (Swank and Conrad) is entertaining. As is the first fight scene at the gas station. Miyagi taming a vicious Doberman, and the owner of the dog picking a fight with him because of it? . And of course, watching Swank perform Karate moves is nothing short of hysterical.Best Line of the Movie: Miyagi explains to Swank, ""Your Grandpa saved Miyagi life... a long time ago... so Miyagi tried to say thank you... teach him karate. He love Karate. He teach your father. Your father teach you."" To which Swank replies, ""And then they died. Everybody died."" Awesome. It was this scene and the delivery of that line that I learned the real range of Swank's talents. I also projected what I was drinking out of my mouth across the room. How this was the jump-off to Swank's career, I have no idea.It's just sad this movie was the last thing we will remember from Pat Morita's acting career. I understand he needed the money, but this is a travesty towards his memory. RIP, Morita. We forgive you."
tt0110657,"The 4th and final karate kid film with Mr Miyagi is by far the worst. It's only notable for being one of Hillary Swank's first films and the brilliant Pat Morita, everything else in this film is terrible and even Hillary Swank's performance is fairly bad compared to her others.The villains are terrible and one dimensional, the villains in the Ralph Macchio trilogy are far superior and more fun, in this they're just cruel and have no character. The fights aren't very exciting either and lack the cinematography and music of the originals, however there are some notable moments such as the final fight whilst not great is ok and has high stakes and the chase through the school was rather tense. The music is decent too, but not enough to save the film.3/10: Total rubbish, probably worth a skip."
tt0110657,"I really like this movie and find it to be underrated. I like that this movie had new dynamic in some ways.Hilary Swank was really good as Julie. She portrayed a troubled adolescent really well and has an interesting relationship with Mr. Miyagi. Pat Morita is his usual amazing self.Eric made for a pretty cool supporting character and a nice love interest for Julie. I also loved getting to know Miyagi's friends.The training scenes and fight at the end were pretty well done. ""You Gotta Be"" by Des'ree is a fantastic song, too.The movie was not without it's silly moments and questionable elements of the plot, but overall I enjoyed it. Like I said, I found it refreshing that they tried something new with this.I wouldn't say it's anywhere near as good as the original Karate Kid or Part II, but I enjoyed it more than part III.RATING: B"
tt0110657,"i am a big fan of the 1st three, even the 3rd one had its good qualities, but there is nothing good about this movie i can say , i am shocked pat Morita did this movie, the story and acting is laughable , the plot makes no sense , the jade smith one is better than this, I'm sorry to say this is a karate kid movie, thank god they didn't make another, i feel like someone used a crane kick on my head after watching it , if i could give it a zero i would. I am so sorry pat that you did this."
tt0110657,"Okay this movie doesn't touch the original three and it's not a masterpiece but it's tolerable and there is enjoyment to be found. I'm the biggest fan there is of the original 3, but this movie isn't quite as bad as they say."
tt0110657,"This film is so bad. I mean, who commissions this stuff? And the costume designer deserves an award for making everyone look like they had just stepped out of 1983. A bloke puts a female wig on and fights....nuff said."
tt0110657,"When analyzing this fourth film of the Karate Kid series (although I would consider it more of a ""distant cousin"" to the original trilogy), the first phrase that comes to mind is ""you can only go to the well so many times"". With ""The Next Karate Kid"", the well ran dry.For a basic plot summary, the film sees Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) mentoring a troubled teen (Hilary Swank) who's parents have passed away. A mash-up of Karate Kid I, II, and III then occurs, with themes from each film present but briefly touched upon.Though I could go on and on about why this film is poor, here is the primary reason: the high expectations. The original ""Karate"" trilogy is so incredible, that anything less from the established characters is going to be a letdown. Thus, the whole movie I kept waiting for great things to happen, but they never did. I can't think of one single scene from this film that tops any scene from the first three.The only thing that elevates ""Next"" above a one star is the performance by Morita as Miyagi. As in KK III, he steals the show with his comedy and words of wisdom.I think that the fourth Karate Kid film can be summed up thusly: Had the original trilogy never been made, this film may be looked at as decent. However, when comparing it to the gold standard of that trilogy, it is hugely disappointing."
tt0462229,"Watching this movie, I kept thinking they couldn't afford to have a real script written, and must have run out of money when they were about 2/3 of the way through, and couldn't finish editing it. Not to mention, they probably couldn't afford Martin Lawrence for the lead role, so they filled it with Cedric the Entertainer, who does better in supporting roles. Cedric does have several funny scenes, though.The plot is completely unintelligible, and undeveloped, but based on the genre you can predict most of the action. It's the ever-popular ""hero has something secret the bad guys want, so they can sell it to terrorists for a fortune, but it's missing."" Not to mention, the scenes or ""shticks"" that have been better done elsewhere. For example, every time Cedric tried to be funny with judo moves, I kept thinking that he ripped that off from Martin, who does it much better. There is a brief cat-fight scene that is far inferior to the one in Undercover Brother (which is an excellent movie, and much funnier overall)."
tt0462229,"Codename: The Cleaner reviewed by Sam OsbornWelcome to January, generally known as the first of two months that consist mostly of studio duds poured discretely from the back of the release slate and into your multiplexes. Like a late August release, January and February releases generally spell 'trash,' with the best of them offering only a nonsensical relief from the heavy, fading awards season. Thus, we have Codename: The Cleaner. It's the latest work from director Les Mayfield, a man whose earlier films (Flubber, American Outlaws, The Man) are best described as righteously mediocre. This January gem weighs in on a case of missing identity and FBI espionage with Cedric the Entertainer playing Jake Rodgers, waking up in a hotel bed with a dead FBI agent and a cut above his ear. His memory's been fried, leaving him without a name and only fragments of what looks to be a secrets ops combat mission batting around his brain. Dianeplayed by Nicollete Sheridan, whose beauty has been stretched and manipulated to the point of mimicking a mask from White Chicksapproaches Jake in the hotel lobby, filling him in on some important details pertaining to their supposed marriage and occupation of a bloated estate mansion. It all turns out to be farce, however, when Jake overhears Diane plotting to send Jake into cardiac arrest over a bit of information surrounding a computer chip. Soon Jake's on the run, doing his best play-pretend imitation of spy work, trying to hunt down the computer chip and unveil his own identity. Like last year's You, Me, and Dupree, Codename: The Cleaner banks heavily on the likability of its lead, giving him the screen-time equivalent of carte blanche. But where Owen Wilson's sly, sandy-haired innocence can grow tiresome, Cedric's rotund antics are nothing if not charming. He leaps to great and often desperate lengths to mine a chuckle, but sometimes surprises us by shoveling out something truly hilarious. So it's a shame that the material surrounding him offers little more than static. Lucy Liu is superbly misused as Jake's girlfriend, rattling off forced punch-lines and rickety, unfitting ""sistah"" feistiness to match Ms. Sheridan's miscasting as the young, busty blonde (the joke here, I suppose, is that Ms Sheridan's peaked forty). The plot feels improvised; so weak that is seems to modify itself according to whatever improvisation Cedric throws at the script. It all comes together like a Jackie Chan Hong Kong action picture, only with Cedric the Entertainer doing the karate. It works, but only if you slouch in your seat and let your ears and eyes glaze over in a popcorn haze. It is January, after all. Sam Osborn"
tt0462229,"Cedric the Entertainer is certainly a talented comedian, but with a script this boring and stupid, even he couldn't breathe life into this horrible mess of a comedy. Despite the bad reviews, I was still slightly eager to check out the movie. The year has just started and already I have a candidate for the worst movies of 2007. The spy comedy has been done to death. And the fact that the writers had nothing new to bring to the table didn't help. I must've chuckled a total of 5 times, and received no laughs whatsoever. As the movie (thankfully) approached its conclusion, I jokingly thought to myself, ""This is probably one of those flicks that contains a gag reel over the closing credits."" Well...I was right! I frequently disapprove of gag reels over the credits of good movies. When you show a gag reel after a bad movie, it's like rubbing salt on a wound. The only part of this movie worth checking out is Nicolette Sheridan doing an erotic dance in her lingerie. If the movie ever makes it to HBO On Demand, I suggest you just fast-forward to that particular scene, mute the sound, and watch it in a loop. Yes, it's that friggin' hot! As for the comedy, expect your usual assortment of bland, crude, sitcom-style gags. If you can't see the punchlines to each gag coming a mile away, you might want to consider getting a cat scan. In one scene, a janitor (one of Cedric's co-workers) is interrogated by a federal agent in a restroom. The agent points a gun at him, urging him to give him some information about Cedric's character. The janitor is an aspiring rapper, and goes on a whole rant about how he wants to be shot, since he wants to be the first rapper to write his songs while in a coma. He bends over, begging the agent to shoot him in the backside. The agent eventually leaves the restroom, as the janitor keeps screaming out, ""Put a bullet in my a**! Put it in my a**! Put it in my as**!"" And--guess what--one of his fellow janitors strolls into the restroom as he continues to scream out, ""Put it in my a**!"" Unless you're a teenager who will laugh at all things scatological, you might want to consider putting a bullet in your own rear end for finding an outrageously stupid gag like that funny. My God! How screenwriters actually get paid to write this crap still boggles my mind! A man of Cedric's talent is capable of doing much, much more, as he's shown in the ""Barbershop"" movies. But when given rotten material like this, he attempts to mend each failed joke with improvisation, which in turn makes the jokes even more annoying."
tt0462229,"I had seen the trailer for ""Code Name: The Cleaner"". It looked like a spy spoof. However, more importantly it starred very hot movie starlets Lucy Liu and Nichollette Sheridan (""Desperate Housewives""). Gathering from the trailers Cedric the Entertainer's character is suffering from some sort of amnesia. He finds out he has a white wife played by Nichollette Sheridan and a mansion. Cedric the Entertainer says, ""I must be Lionel Richie."" I thought that was hilarious. However, I am old. Audiences today are more familiar with the arrests and eating habits of his daughter Nicole Richie. Thus, this is the inherent miscalculation of ""Code Name: The Cleaner"". The movie was probably funny to those making the movie, without a tangible audience in mind. Too bad. I really like Cedric the Entertainerhe is funny. But he is so off the mark here. Sexy Nichollette Sheridan is whacked out as the femme fa-tale Diane posing as Jake's (Cedric the Entertainer) wife. The only thing that could have saved the movie is if her lingerie mysteriously slipped off her stunning body. Really, too bad. Lucy Liu looks fabulous and looks killer in the marital arts action sequences. Her fight scene with Sheridan could have been a lot longer. Also, too bad.There is little redeeming in ""Code Name: The Cleaner"" other than its stars. For that blame the lameness of Director Les Mayfield and the horrendous writing of Robert Adetuyi and George Gallo. The tell tale symptom of this miserable collapse is that the most entertaining part of the movie are the outtakes at the end. Seems at least the cast and crew were having fun. One can only hope that there is more of Cedric, Sheridan, and Liu in the DVD release. Don't hold your breath."
tt0462229,"Ever since Cedric the Entertainer burst onto the scene with his critically acclaimed, scene-stealing performance in the original ""Barbershop,"" no filmmaker has quite figured out how best to harness the considerable talents of this longtime standup comic. In the years since that film was released, C the E has appeared in one monumental turkey after another, with his latest endeavor, ""Code Name: The Cleaner,"" marking what we can only hope will be a professional low point before he begins his gradual ascent back towards some degree of cinematic respectability.In what is clearly one of the lamest, dopiest and most ill-conceived spy comedies in movie history, Cedric plays an amnesia victim who wakes up in a hotel room next to a dead FBI agent and a suitcase stuffed with hundreds of thousands of dollars. Unsure of who he is - the possibilities range all the way from an undercover spy to a local janitor - or how he managed to get himself into such a predicament, the mystery man, Jake, is soon on the run from unknown forces out to nab him and the valuable computer chip it is believed he has in his possession.This is such a perfectly ridiculous piece of celluloid-wasting cinema that it is scarcely worth the time it takes to watch, let alone comment on, the movie. Suffice it to say that Cedric needs to start looking into getting himself a better agent, while his co-stars - like Lucy Liu, whose career is clearly in as much trouble as Cedric's - should begin deleting this film from their professional resumes as quickly as is humanly possible."
tt0462229,"For a James Bond prototype, this isn't that bad. One of the few that deserve more attention then they really get. The only other 'Bond' prototype that is as funny as this one would be Johnny English. Yes, we all have seen the plot, but it's the twist to the storyline that keeps it interesting. This time our hero wakes up in a hotel room, on the bed next to the dead man's body. It starts out more of a mystery, then quickens the pace just before the half way mark comes. Cedric is clearly at the top of his game both pyhsically and in his jokes. For sure he does a better job at keeping his material censored, heck, depending on the child, this could even be a kids movie."
tt0462229,"Friday night my wife and I went to see Code Name: The Cleaner, staring Cedric Kyles (AKA Cedric the Entertainer) and Lucy Liu. It's about Jake, a man who wakes up in a hotel room, next to a dead body, with no memory of who he is or how he got there. As events unfold around him, he starts to recollect that he is a secret agent, and puts together that he was working undercover as a janitor on a deadly mission.This was another fun movie. It had a PG-13 rating but I would say that it was a fairly mild PG-13 (a few shootouts and Nicollette Sheridan in her undies), so I wouldn't worry too much about taking a 13 year old to see it. It's the first movie I've seen with Cedric in the lead role and only the second with him in it at all (Serving Sara was the first). I really liked him. He was absolutely hilarious without going over the top. Of course Lucy Liu is always a sight to behold.The rating it has received on IMDb was a dismal 3.0 but that was because a significant number (52%) of the votes were a 1. I suspect that the movie or one of it's actors really perturbed some group, so they retaliated with a vote drive. There is no way this movie rated a 1. I personally gave it a 7 and my wife tells me we will own this.Incidentally, stick around for the first half of the credits. The show some very good outtakes."
tt0462229,"This film begins with a man named ""Jake Rogers"" (Cedric Antonio Kyles) waking up in a bed at a hotel and finding a dead body right next to him. To make matters even worse, because of a recent head injury he not only doesn't remember how he got into this situation, but he also doesn't remember who he is. However, as luck would have it there is a small attache case with approximately $250,000 in it and an attractive blonde named ""Diane"" (Nicollette Sheridan) waiting for him in the hotel lobby who claims to be his wife. And to top it off he is apparently quite rich as well. However, that doesn't seem to matter as much as it should because he soon realizes that there are people out to kill him over a computer chip that he doesn't know anything about. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film definitely had some good humor here and there. Likewise, having two attractive actresses like Lucy Liu (as the waitress named ""Gina"") and the aforementioned Nicollette Sheridan certainly didn't hurt matters either. Having said that, however, I must admit that some of the comedy was rather low-brow and the film could have used a bit more suspense or drama as well. Even so, I thought that this was an okay film for the time spent and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average."
tt0462229,"I saw the movie last night. I am a fan of Cedric The Entertainer. He is so funny! Nicolette and Lucy Liu added to this cast made it a dynamic movie.I liked how the story line kept you guessing on ""Jake"" the role that Cedric played and what was his true identity and job.And to see him play not only a comedic role as he usually does, but a role filled with action.........Loved it! I would recommend this movie for all to see. I liked how it was not filled with lots of cursing, explicit sex scenes and lots of blood and guts. Yes there was some fighting etc, but I found it more in a humorous way it was done.Ciao, Leslie"
tt0462229,"I don't know why some people slander this movie. They should get some antidepressants or something - somethings not right with these people anyway. This movie is well made, has good actors doing a great job, interesting (but somewhat predictable) plot! It has pretty much everything you want from a nice action/comedy movie and I certainly enjoyed the movie a lot.I almost gave it a seven but I'm a cheap b*stard - and even if it's closer to a seven than six - it falls just short of it... =)I just made up my mind - why the h*ll not..."
tt0462229,"I have no idea why I rented this film. It must have been the name Lucy Liu. This type of comedy is not something I like, though it probably will appeal to some.The Cleaner from 2007 stars Cedric Kyles, Lucy Liu, and Nicolette Sheridan. Jake (Kyles) wakes up in a hotel with a dead body next to him. He has no memory of who he is or what he's doing in the hotel. Then he meets a beautiful blond, Diane (Sheridan) who claims to be his wife. When he goes to a restaurant, the waitress (Liu) pours a pitcher of cold water on him -- he doesn't remember having any relationship with her, but she's plenty angry.Slowly he starts to realize that he was a secret agent undercover as a janitor, and that his enemies want something he has.To be honest, the outtakes shown at the end were funnier.Cedric the Entertainer, as he is called, is funny with a nice presence, but this movie was just a lot of slapstick and shootouts. Lucy Liu was sexy and tough in her role -- it turns out she's an agent. There just wasn't much to it as far as humor. Mark Dacascos is so handsome, it was almost worth watching it for him.I don't have too much to say -- if it weren't for the fact that Nicolette Sheridan prances around in her skimpy underwear, a five year old might enjoy this movie."
tt0462229,"This film is not very good. Cederic the Entertainer can be quite funny as a stand up comic, and he was hilarious in both ""Barbershop"" films, but here he is not funny, nor is the rest of the cast. This is a poor attempt to make a spy comedy, and spy comedies are usually not that good to begin with.The only spy comedies that I have found to be hilarious were the 1983 film ""Bullshot"" and Leslie Nielson in 1996's ""Spy Hard"" The old amnesia attempt is used here to string together 90 mins of absolutely no laughs.2 out of 10"
tt0462229,"With perhaps any other contemporary actor in the lead role -- Jake Rodgers, aka, The Cleaner (Cedric the Entertainer) -- this film would have been a total bust. As some of the other folks commenting on here have already mentioned, the storyline is both contrived and in many ways superconventionally executed -- so much so that it risks becoming one long cliché. If you're looking for stimulating American cinema, or even a good action movie or espionage thriller, you should see something else.What saves CODE NAME: THE CLEANER for me, I think, is the utter preposterousness of casting Cedric the Entertainer as an amnesiac slowly convincing himself (and, supposedly, the viewer) that he is actually a secret agent working for the American government. I love Lucy Liu, but this is not her (best) film -- she plays more or less the same character she has played elsewhere (including the borderline racist trope that, since she is of Asian descent, she must be a masterful practitioner of at least one martial art) -- although her performance is true, and is enhanced comically by her playing opposite Cedric. None of the rest of the characters or actors -- including Nicollette Sheridan -- does much for the film, and the writing and direction are mediocre at best. But Cedric the Entertainer trying to convince us he's a superspy? That's worth the rental."
tt0462229,"I found ""Code Name: The Cleaner"" to be a harmless, entertaining little spy comedy-mystery, and was somewhat surprised to find so many negative reviews about it. The plot is intriguing enough to keep your attention and adds up quite well, Cedric The Entertainer is more often funny than not, Lucy Liu and Nicollette Sheridan are both very sexy (no James Bond film since ""Goldeneye"" has had such a dynamite female combo), and the action / martial arts parts are surprisingly solidly handled: Mark Dacascos and Lucy Liu are in top form, and even Cedric and Sheridan get to perform some moves! Strange as it may seem, Liu does better action work here than in both ""Charlie's Angels"" films! On the whole, this is not the kind of movie that will change your life, but it's perfectly watchable just the same. (**1/2)"
tt0462229,"20 August 2017. Cedric the Entertainer is no Geena Davis nor Kevin James in this comedic espionage action thriller. Geena Davis played a housewife with amnesia in The Longest Kiss Goodnight (1997) while more recently Kevin James played a wannabe author in True Memoirs of an International Assassin (2016), both comedy action movies involving spies and espionage. While Lucy Liu from Charlie's Angels (2000), Ballistics: Ecks and Sever (2002), and Cypher (2002) brings her confident, sparkly, pixy performance, Cedric keeps the over the top montage, the leftover of dumb slapstick of Peter Seller and Jerry Lewis (who recently passed away). But even Lucy Lui has seen better scripts than her's in this movie. The storyline isn't nothing special and the performances are average."
tt0462229,"We've seen this premise before in countless comedies in the past, an ordinary man with amnesia who finds himself ducking bullets and has to figure out what's going on. It's possible that it could have successfully been done again, but this particular effort doesn't make the grade. I'll start with the actors. Cedric The Entertainer does seem to be trying at times, and sometimes he comes across as a likable goof, but more often he comes across as loud-mouthed and abrasive. Lucy Liu has a thankless role as the woman who helps him, and Mark Dacascos is totally wasted as the villain, even though he does get to show off some martial arts (which are badly choreographed and directed.) But the main problem with the movie is the script and direction. The movie contains some blatant product plugs, several instances where the action comes to a halt to show off some ""hilarious"" comedy (such as the Dutch dance sequence), and an ending that does not know when to quit. And the outtakes shown at the end are even less funny than the scripted gags that preceded them!"
tt0462229,"Had never watched this movie and it was on Netflix with the french/canada audio track so i was like ""why not?"". If you watched a bunch of 2000s movies, this one is right in the textbook section of that era.I don't know exactly how to describe it with words but it reminded me of movies like National Security for instance. The humor is not completely slapstick but its a bit exagerated, with characters being a bit cartoonish in a way. But thats something i like. Its basically a light hearted comedy and since it was made in the late 2000s, its completely free of any wokeness so bonus points.Every main actors had their charm and were funny and the overall story despite being another of these ""microchip to control the world yada yada"" that you seen a million time was totally servicable. The fun happen in the interactions between the 3 main leads. You also get an extended cameo by Marc Dacascos wich is an actor i always enjoyed.Overall just a good time and worth a watch if you never seen it."
tt0462229,"This movie is nothing more than a collection of poorly executed, denigrating tropes. It's racist AF and a total sausage fest. I've seen some people describe it as light and entertaining, but I can't imagine watching it and not being insulted. If you're not Black, Asian or a woman, you should at least be insulted to be handed such an uninspired pile of garbage.It's possible to engage damaging tropes with comedy in a way that disarms them, but this film exploits them instead, which is just lazy."
tt0462229,"While this by far the best comedy I've seen, it had it's moments.But that's not to say that it was bad.The worst part was in the mansion...the butler role was absolutely dreadful and unneeded.In fact the entire scene with the butler should have been cut and something else added in.Clearly the lead role was not written for Cedric...he seemed lost in it in many areas and just didn't fit quite right.Ronnie, however was a riot as the rapping custodian. His bathroom scene was just hilarious and possibly the best in the entire movie.**A little known fact is that Jake's house - the blue one was filed in a well known drug house in Vancouver, BC and had to be searched by police with dogs before filming began in the house."
tt0462229,"Don't be fooled with Lucy in credits. The movie is so bad that I switched it off after 7 min.. No acting, poor dialogs."
tt0462229,"I was working all day and I thought that nothing would be better, than a nice comedy to cheer me up. But unfortunately I was wrong. The movie started fine, not awful, not great. After about 20-25min of the movie I realized that the movie wont be on my top list. More precisely it was going to be one of the worst movies. First of all movies about spies, especially comedy related ones, are all washed up. Secondly in this certain movie you can see ahead, everything is so obvious that even an eleven year old kid would be bored. The dialogs are very poor, all the ""funny"" things were already used in other movies. I was really very surprised about the quality of it, as there are at least three good actors in it. Personally I think that Cedric the Entertainer and Lucy Liu are better actors than it is seen in this movie. I advise you, if you don't have anything else to watch, pick up a book or listen to music. The time will be better spent."
tt1255916,"Hostel: Part III could be so named for the three main points that set it apart from its predecessors.One: the departure from Slovakia to Vegas. Ultimately, this turns out to be a good decision. Bringing the chaos closer to home (for us Americans) adds an effective layer of chill and gives us something fresh and new to work with, as opposed to churning out what could have been basically a remake of the original film. At times the nostalgia of the foreign setting was missed, but ultimately I accept it as a wise choice.Two: Roth is out, Spiegel is in. The change in direction is noticed heavily, and in the end I was disappointed and left wishing Eli Roth had never given up the reigns.Three: Straight to DVD. This, also, was a change that was noticed for all the wrong reasons.The film kicks off with a highly interesting opening scene with a twist in which our expectations are squashed and it is established that we are working with a totally new style of villain. We see that the Elite Hunting Club has progressed into something much more advanced than just a pay-to-kill deal, and while a little over-the-top, I enjoyed the new additions to the game. During the climax we are fed table-turning twist that had my heart pumping with excitement. Sadly, however, here is where my praise ends.The torture scenes are terrible. They are all bad ideas executed very poorly. Furthermore, they are over within seconds and contain almost no gore compared to the first two (an OBVIOUS reference to the lack of budget). The cinematography is dead on arrival. Don't expect the dark and gritty look that is required for this type of film, but instead look forward to distracting brightness and elegance. And finally, the acting (spare one or two) is the worst of the series.Overall, I give it a painfully mediocre rating of 5/10. I do, however, definitely recommend you to see it if you liked the first two. Just go into it with low expectations so you will not be let down, and look out for the unique routes the story takes instead of the torture sequences. These fresh twists and turns are bittersweet, though, because it showcases the fact that the film could have been a big success had the necessary efforts been put into it. Hostel: Part III will forever be known to me as the little film that could... but didn't."
tt1255916,"Hostel 3 has absolutely no reference to Eli Roth. That's the first hint you get that this probably isn't exactly the sequel you are hoping for.The movie sets about the same story that was featured in the previous 2 parts only this time uses actors and actresses who aren't exactly gifted. I've seen my fair share of horror, good and bad, and this definitely qualifies as a bad movie.The acting is poor, the story a quick rehash of the stuff we've already seen and once the gore hits its actually uninspired and with a total lack of anxiety for us as viewers.You'd be better off looking at ""A Lonely Place To Die"" or ""Kill List"". Im sorry for everyone involved, but in short: avoid!"
tt1255916,"Gone is director Eli Roth, the desolate European location and a major theatrical release, but that didn't stop Sony Pictures from developing a third entry in the semi-successful but uber-popular Hostel series.Ingeniously titled Hostel Part III, the terror comes to America with a setting in none other than Sin City itself – Las Vegas, where a group of guys get together for a bachelor party only to have their week-end fun interrupted by events of torture and extreme misfortune at the hands of the Elite Hunting Club.The 'fun' begins when one of the four bachelor party friends is abducted from an out-of-control party. He is taken to some remote yet high class facility that has state-of-the-art torture rooms equipped with classy looking tables and display walls filled with random torturing tools. Outside the room watching behind a large glass pane are a group of high class business men and women who use hi-tech betting equipment to play 'Wheel of Misfortune' – a gambling game where they can bet on everything such as what a tortured individual might yell out when at the height of their pain.Meanwhile, the remaining friends begin a desperate search to find their missing companion. A search that will land them in the same torture room subjected to the gruesome effects of the sadistic game.Directed by Scott Spiegel, Hostel III has no resemblance to the previous Eli Roth creations. The new setting might bring the series into a more modern world, but it was the dark, dungy backdrop of Slovakia that made Hostel that much more frighteningly believable.Screenwriters attempted to fill Hostel III with rudimentary twists in an attempt to try and out-smart their audience, but they were generally unnecessary and hardly OMG material. Couple that with some extremely unfunny lines (""Is this a joke?"" one about to be tortured man screams answered by ""Oh yea, and the punchline is a killer"") and characters that as wooden as an Ikea bedroom furniture set and you get the gist of this unworthy third entry.Of course, billed as a horror film, it is the torture (or torture porn) and bloodletting that will make or break the film with franchise fans and Hostel III can't hold a candle to the two Roth installments. Even with a state-of-the-art torture facility, the kills are truly uninspired and lacking in any true 'I can't watch' scenes of extremedom (I just made that word up). And nudity? Well, let's just say that Hostel III can border on the PG-13 edge of nudism.With an opening scene that did nothing more than offer a chuckle to an ending that was just plain stupid, Hostel III proves that the franchise is now dead and those that have been tortured the most are us saps that paid money to soothe our curiosity with Part III.www.killerreviews.com"
tt1255916,"...not really very good. The opening scene got my hopes up for this movie but it never really gets going. The change from desolate post-Soviet landscape to Vegas doesn't work at all. Eastern Europe (or maybe Asia/Africa/Middle East) would have provided a more suitable backdrop to this movie.At least this 3rd in the series didn't just increase the footage of graphic torture-porn - it was more subdued than I expected. But I can't help feeling this, like the US of A setting, was more to do with getting a wider release at a lower classification than artistic taste & restraint.A solid B movie."
tt1255916,"I watched this movie and kept thinking WTF was wrong with the writers/editors/and even Director.... This was undeniably the worst movie out of three. Hostel franchise has carved a niche among a certain class of movie-goers and this one is definitely a Slap on all of our faces.Ridiculous story, poor cast, awful acting, funny CGI, cheap grade torture/execution and the list is on and on.. What is ""NEW"" in this installment is the ""camera move"" during torture... It literally moves towards the ""Wall"" and all we can see is the blood splashing out.C'mon, is this for real. Looks like the new director simply never watched the previous movies and literally decided to direct one for his 6-7 years old kids..My advice: Save your penny and don't even think about renting it. You will get furious and eventually end up breaking up the DVD, which will later cost you more... ;)"
tt1255916,"Let me start by saying I'm a huge fan of Hostel 1 & 2 along with the Saw franchise etc. OK so i first saw Hostel 3 available in my local Tesco store on DVD. I couldn't believe my eyes... another Hostel film?! Why hadn't i even heard about this. Being an avid IMDb user i immediately looked it up when i got home and was gutted to see so many bad reviews about it. I was instantly put off and thought ""ok i won't bother with this one."" Hearing Eli Roth had not directed it either was a major blow to me and i instantly forgot about it. A few days later i came across a Hostel DVD box set of all 3 movies for a tenner. I was gob smacked seeing that 3 had only just recently come out and was £13 in my local Tesco store! I snapped up the box set off of Amazon and thought well at least iv'e got all 3 of them for a tenner and one day i might watch part 3.When the box set arrived i still didn't check out part 3 due to the bad reviews i have heard and the amount of slating going on about it. It was a week later on a boring rainy afternoon that i thought what the hell let's see how bad this really is. I said to myself i'll watch half hour and if it really is that awful i will turn it off and never go there again.Hostel 3 in my opinion given the chance will keep you watching beyond the half hour point. The movie opens up with a twist fairly near the start that i didn't see coming for such an ""awful"" movie. I actually really enjoyed the first half hour and didn't think about turning it off. The first say 45mins of the film is all leading up to that big first kill... i expected a kill a lot sooner but never the less the story and build up kept me hooked. The first kill was Hostel worthy without a doubt.... I've seen this first kill get slated on other reviews saying it was unrealistic or not gory enough etc I disagree and think it would meet the needs of those looking for that Hostel style kill.... i say no more about that.My gripe is with Hostel 3 is that i wish Eli Roth had directed it... if he had taken this idea on and executed it his way then i wouldn't have found the 2nd half of the film as disappointing as i did. I loved the first half of the movie and the first kill but it seemed to go a bit downhill from there. The second kill was weak in my opinion and it's the twists and turns in the movie's second half that kept me interested rather then the kills. I gave this movie an honest 6 but i did enjoy it. It's hard when your competing against the first 2 Hostels but i certainly think it deserves more then 5 for the effort. The storyline is engaging, there's twists and turns you wont see coming and there's a gory kill (the first one). I think the ending along with the second half of the movie was a let down gore wise and after all this is what Hostel is supposed to be about... imaginative gory kills. But don't completely write it off as i did. It's deffo worth a watch if your a Hostel fan. ;0"
tt1255916,"Exspect the unexpected in hostel 3, if you haven't seen the other ones it's fine but i highly recommend them."
tt1255916,"I had low expectations for this, and after watching it, I really just think they should have put more effort & money into it. You won't see the gore that was in the first 2 movies, mostly just splattering blood, but the story and change of scenery was a nice twist. The lower budget is evident. I thought the acting was fine except for a couple over-the-top performances. The first half set up was good, but the second half just seemed rushed. Maybe they were running out of money. I thought they should have expanded on the new Las Vegas Hunting Club set up a lot more. Was it purely for betting purposes? Were the Hunters paid to perform or were they paying to kill as in the first movies? The first kill had potential, but it felt unfinished... The second kill made no sense at all. The third one screamed for a higher budget... Someone once said that they don't understand why they are remaking great movies, what they should be doing is remaking not so good movies. This is a candidate for the latter."
tt1255916,"I didn't hold out much hope for this sequel to what I thought was a pretty good movie the first time out. The second one was up there as well and I enjoyed them both. This one just didn't hit the spot and was a bit disappointing.Unlike the first two being set in a foreign country this one is set in Las Vegas and that is, I think the first mistake. The second mistake is the lack of blood and gore and fairly tame violence up until the last 10 minutes of the movie.There were a few twists that gave me a few enjoyable surprises. I especially liked the one in the first 6 minutes of the movie. The others while nice were not totally unexpected.Some of the ideas were good, but I felt that the tame way in which some of the victims were killed just didn't fit with the Hostel theme that was set by the first two."
tt1255916,"This is the first movie I've reviewed on IMDb. This movie was so awful I had to login and review it because it was that bad. This movie feels nothing like the first two movies. The first two Hostel movies felt very raw and unedited. This movie looks like it was made for 12 yr old girls. The concept was OK, not great. The acting was poor. The script was terrible as was the poor CGI and the obvious rubber knife in the middle of the movie. As another reviewer pointed out they don't show any of the actual kills in this movie like the first two, they just zoom out and show blood squirting. Lame. And what's with the no nudity? This isn't a Disney film. This is NOT a movie that any director should feel good about hanging his hat on. My 8 yr old niece could have made a better Hostel movie. If you want to have a good Hostel experience, don't watch this one."
tt1255916,"Hostel was gritty and edgy, with a fine cast and well executed. Hostel 3 however is lacking in all of these features. Cheapens the franchise."
tt1255916,"The twist in the first scene was excellent. The rest of it was disgusting but if you're going to watch Histek, what do you expect"
tt1255916,"I appreciate what some narrow-minded gore snobs are saying about this entry's clever use of subtlety in favor over the excessive, graphic violence and gore that sometimes kills suspense and lends nothing to most sequels. Instead, this Hostel entry breaks the mold with well-timed gags, fake-outs, misdirection, and legitimate suspense. I can honestly say I didn't expect one thing that happened in the movie from the beginning. Every sharp turn kept the plot more interesting and the action more intense, and that more of the action took place outside the torture room was much more satisfying in my opinion. The gore and violence in the torture scenes and around Vegas is more than sufficient, and wickedly satisfying compared to the other, more disturbing and nasty torture sequences of the former films. There seemed to be an overall homage to ""what would really happen in 'The Hangover'"" that played out perfectly. I liked the characters, who were basically believable and surprisingly well acted. I like how the director played on the audience's stereotypes at certain times, and I would be very interested in seeing more of this production crew."
tt1255916,"Going to keep this one short, as this movie deserves no better. This is like the PG-13 version of 'Hostel' All the things we like about 'Hostel' are no where to be found in this film. Very little gore, and its all off camera. Nothing has been added to the hostel story arc, other then the fact that they now brought the story to the US. Which was a bad mistake in my opinion, they should has left it in Europe. There is no character development whatsoever. The acting is bland at best. There is better special effects on prime-time television commercials. It pretty much seems to me that this was only made as a quick cash grab to cash in from the people that like this kind of series, at the time of year when most people have a little money to spend. Do yourself a favour and pick up the unrated version of the original on blue-ray instead, and stay far away from this corporate garbage as you can."
tt1255916,"A universally acknowledged and practiced, albeit unwritten, rule in horror states that sequels are always supposed to be nastier, more brutal and more relentless than its predecessor(s). If this rule was applicable to the infamous ""Hostel"" series, it normally would have meant that number three was one of the sickest, most depraved things ever shot on film. But Eli Roth can comfortably sleep on both his ears, as his original two installments are FAR more disgusting and shocking than the overall weak and pitiable third effort. This is a straight-to-video release with obvious budgetary restrictions, but there are a few other aspects contributing to the fact this isn't a very successful sequel. The one thing which made Roth's movies unique was the authentically raw and uncanny East-European filming locations. The poor suckers in ""Hostel I & II"" were young enthusiast students that ended up in the grimmest areas of ""dubious"" countries like Czech Republic and Slovakia, subsequently to be captured by heavily scarred Slavic beefcakes with whom they couldn't communicate at all. Their actual purpose was to serve as living & bleeding toys for rich businessmen who paid fortunes in order to submit their victims to the cruelest and most agonizing torture games. For ""Hostel III"", the torture playground has moved towards Fabulou$ La$ Vega$, which is pretty much the least scary place on the planet if you ask me, and the torturing gimmick has been processed into the daily gambling activities. When four pals head to Vegas to celebrate Scott's bachelor party, they wake up the next day noticing that one of them didn't make it back to the hostel. He was last seen with one of the hired escort girls, so they don't immediately panic, but when searching for him they get sucked into a dangerous spiral of kidnapping, illegal gambling and painful loss ratios. The lack of gore in ""Hostel III"" is almost astounding! Some of the deaths are literally bloodless and even the ""gorier"" ones are never truly upsetting or remotely shocking. Several of the scenes in Roth's films made you cringe and nearly even experience the pain. Director Scott Spiegel, in a distant past responsible for the excellent late 80's slasher ""Intruder"", admirably attempts to compensate for the gore-shortage through sub plots and story twists, but (a) this isn't what the die-hard fans of the franchise were waiting for, and (b) even the plot twists are predictable and unsurprising. The performances are mediocre, with the exception of Kip Pardue who's truly insufferable. The only real positive thing I can say about the cast is that Zulay Henao (escort chick #2) is very cute. ""Hostel III"" is just a plain weak film, better skipped by the avid fans of parts one and two."
tt0136153,"English Babu Desi Mem combines many elements: romance, drama, comedy and music. At times choppy, it did fulfill those elements, though weakly at times. Both the conflict and romance between Vikram and Bijiriya (shabrukh Khan and ) could be felt, the chemistry was there. The love between Bijiriya and Nandu (Sunny Singh) was full of affection and devotion. I was quite taken with Sunny Singh's performance actually. There were serious elements in the movie, and they were portrayed sincerely. The poignancy is what I will remember most when I look back on this film. The comedy was goofy, but that was largely a result of zooming in on the characters'whenever they made exaggerated faces. I liked quite a bit of the songs/lyrics, and the dancing was well done, a credit to a good choreographer."
tt0136153,"The general idea behind the movie is interesting.  The movie itself was predictable.  SRK was so funny at the beginning!  The songs weren't that good; some were catchy, some weren't.  The action scene left a lot to be desired by Western standards, but weren't that bad for a Hindi film.  The ending was cute too."
tt0136153,"Pravin Nischol's 'English Babu Desi Mem' has been labled as Shahrukh Khan's worst movies. I last saw it more than a decade ago and have recently revisited it. 'Worst film' is an 'over' exaggeration. If this is Khan's worst then what are 'Koyla', 'Trimurti', 'RaOne' and 'Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna' (which are much worse in my opinion)? 'Engish Babu Desi Mem' certainly has its share of faults. The story's quite naive, sometimes even a bit silly and cheesy but on the other hand it doesn't pretend to be anything else.An energetic Shahrukh Khan and sizzling Sonali Bendre make a terrific screen pair. Their chemistry is solid. Shahrukh had already established himself as a versatile actor and his scenes with Sonali and child actor Sunny Singh are some of the best moments of the film Sonali Bendre is outstanding. Not only did she show great potential as an actress back then but she also gets to display her versatile dancing skill. Child actor Sunny Singh does a good enough job. Saeed Jaffrey is also quite likable. All the actors seem to have played off each other and have had a good time filming.The songs are enjoyable. The lyrics aren't anything particularly great but the melody's fine and it certainly has you tapping your feet or even humming. The visualization of the tracks is also well done and they are paced out well throughout the film.On the technical side, I was positively surprised by the cinematography which is brilliant here. In the 90s, poor cinematography was quite abundant in Hindi films.To me 'English Babu Desi Mem' is solid entertainment, with heart. It has all the ingredients of a successful masala (spicy) film and perhaps above all, it's sincere."
tt0136153,"Along with Guddu, English Babu Desi Mem is known to be one of Shahrukh Khan's worst films. It is. The movie starts with a melodramatic sequence which is a kind of a prologue to the entire story. One couple dies upon the birth of their son. The deceased wife's little sister decides to bring this baby up all alone. Right after that it moves several years forward and we are presented with a young Sonali Bendre dancing in a bar. Her nephew Nandu is now 8 years old and she works hard to feed him. But Vikram Mayur, Nandu's paternal uncle, has come to India to take the kid to England, as he is the successor of their dynasty. That's the basic story of this movie, and it just does not work. Maybe it's got to do something with the fact that we expect more from Khan and his movies. Khan himself is pretty good and as expected he has a great chemistry with the leading lady. Sonali Bendre is very pretty and she does a fairly good job as well. The kid is okay. The film's music does not add that much. English Babu Desi Mem has its moments, but they are few and are not enough to make a watchable film. If anything, this one is worthy of a one-time watch and nothing more."

Nandu has been raised in India by his young aunt, Bijuriya (Sonali Bendre), who supports them both by dancing in a club. Vikram goes to India to bring Nandu back with him, an event which leads to many emotional complications.This movie was declared a flop at release, but it's really not bad. The plot is predictable, but at times quite moving. The acting from the leads was solid, but the child actors were fantastic. Young Sunny Singh gave a compelling performance and the actress who played the child Bijuriya was a natural. (Unfortunately, I've been unable to find who this child was for certain, but it may have been Baba Brahmbhatt.) Bijuriya's near-vulgar dance routines are particularly unappealing, however, giving the film a sleazy feel not compatable with the innocence of the rest of the movie. While English Babu Desi Mem is not a stand-out movie, it's mostly enjoyable, and the child actors make it worth watching once."

tt2677816,The movie was really cool specially the comedy sequences were the best and since it has some flaws compared to the original specially the songs doesn't had suitable songs. delly belly had really nice song like Bhaag D K Bose which pushed the movie even more and as usual santhanam rocked the show with his brilliant comedy
tt2528814,"Yeah, it's a bad movie, but I was expecting something entertaining. Not like, ""pretentious"" bad. There's not really any message within ""God's Not Dead"", just an assortment of validated stereotypes. And even though the film seemingly debates the existence of an all-powerful being, it's really more concerned with extraneous side characters and the shoehorning of reality stars and a rock band. Kevin Sorbo's playing a personified strawman (before going full-on bad guy), which should give you an idea just how seriously this movie treats the philosophical subject matter. What made it hard to stomach was the syrupy tone; it felt a lot like ""Crash"", and that's the last thing I need with a movie about God.But its real crime is the horrible pacing; an interminable two hours. This thing's a trainwreck.4/10"
tt2528814,"It's impossible to review Christian films because if you're a believer you think this is a great film with a great message. If you're a skeptic or an out and out atheist you'll not view it kindly. Credit however should have gone to such items as Crash, Magnolia, and heaven forfend Boogie Nights because in terms of structure God's Not Dead most closely resembles those films. There's a bunch of stories with people all interconnected somehow.But the main plot line involves young Shane Harper who is a Christian kid who is taking philosophy as an elective course. Instead of free academic discourse we have Professor Kevin Sorbo right off the bat wants to have his students declare God is dead. Harper is the one holdout and Sorbo essentially turns the class over to him, not for just one lecture, but for several periods where Harper has to get up and defend his faith.Back in the day I had college professors, mostly liberals to be sure, but would never act like Kevin Sorbo does. Later on we learn in the film that he's got some deep issues.As for Harper, he's told by the local pastor David A.R. White that this is an opportunity to go to bat for his faith. It would have been a lot easier to just drop the course and take another elective. In fact Harper is such a devoted believer one wonders why he's not in some place like Jerry Falwell's Liberty Baptist University or Pat Robertson's Regent University. Especially the latter since they have a law school there with guaranteed employment in the Justice Department when a Republican administration is in power.As we all know Kevin Sorbo first came to prominence portraying that most mythic of pagan heroes Hercules on television. Another former television superhero in this film is former Superman Dean Cain who is a lawyer with one colossal ego. His part is almost a caricature, especially when his girlfriend tells him she's got cancer. What a comfort Cain is to her.Christian icons like Willie and Korie Robertson from Duck Dynasty make an appearance. The finale is a concert by that most noted Christian Rock group the Newsboys. As a non-believer, not an anti-believer and there is a difference despite the position this film takes I'm not thoroughly trashing a job moderately well done. Why though the existence of a Creator/Deity is automatically meaning that a fundamentalist interpretation of Christianity is necessarily valid. Or a literal interpretation of any religion for that matter. Harper even concedes that there was no literal 24/7 creation. I suspect that if he had tried to defend the Bible in a literal interpretation of the flood or Joshua stopping the sun, etc., things might have turned out differently.One thing however did offend me greatly. David A.R. White is playing host to a visiting missionary from some unnamed African country. These are the same people who are currently pushing with glee and delight pogrom like laws against gay people in many African countries. Of course no mention of that in God's Not Dead, but I assure you that any gay people who see this film will mark it well for this colossal bit of hubris.Technically God's Not Dead is not a horrible film, but people depending on their point of view will react accordingly to it."
tt2528814,"... when he said the movies are a great big empathy machine. At least in this case he probably was, because this film is a great big stereotype machine.I'll cut it some slack on acting and direction because the whole thing was shot in 20 days with probably a low budget. The screenplay itself, mainly focusing on the conflict between Christian student Josh Wheaton and his atheist philosophy professor, really has a narrow point of view. The film really paints everything with a black and white brush and makes assumptions about atheists - AND people from other faiths and countries - that cause much of the criticism of the Christian community in the first place. I know several atheists, and they are not all narcissists that abandon sick friends or people that blame God for some tragedy in their past. Many of them have a behavior code that exceeds that of Christians because they do not have a ""ticket to heaven in my pocket"" mentality which many Christians do have and I have observed.Meanwhile, we get a look at what is supposed to pass for a typical Arab-American Muslim household, as dad always makes sure that his daughter Ayisha has her face totally covered when he drops her off at school. He doesn't seem to mind that she has on short sleeves and clothes that are just as revealing as her peers. Note to dad - the face is not the only physical thing about a young lady that catches the eye of young men. No matter though, because as soon as dad is out of sight. Ayisha removes the face covering. It turns out that Ayisha is a closet Christian, and when dad finds out he reacts as we would expect any Muslim man to react who is three times his daughters size - he smacks her around fist to face and then physically throws her out into the street. Getting back to the film's main protagonist,Josh, he is now having to debate the philosophy prof in class as to the existence of God using philosophical arguments or else he will fail. The in-class debate part of the film was interesting, but I believe professor Raddison when he said they did not have pre-law at the university, because just about every action he took was completely illegal, from threatening his students with failing grades or at least greatly enhanced workloads if they did not write down ""God is dead"" on a piece of paper and sign it, to confronting and taunting the student Josh when he began to get his goat.Josh makes a big deal during his portion of the debate about God allowing free will to reign on earth and that being the reason for all of the evil, and then the plot goes on to disprove exactly that by implying divine destruction of the ignition capabilities of every car that two random missionaries on their way to Disneyland touch (in one of many sideplots) so that they can be at a particular place at a crucial time. As one missionary states to the other ""God has you exactly where he wants you"". What happened to free will if these two are just manipulated actors in God's grandiose play? Other interesting points - apparently all atheists turn to Christ when confronted with death (a point the late Christopher Hitchens disproves), and exactly what is this generic cancer that the atheist blogger has? Inquiring minds want to know. Plus - filmmakers - I know plagiarism is the sincerest form of flattery, but many of us know an ""I am Spartacus"" moment when we see it (Josh's argument in favor of the existence of God causes everybody in the class to stand and say ""God is not dead""). The great irony here - the screenwriter for Spartacus was James Dalton Trumbo, who just happened to be an atheist. I would say this film is worth watching as a curiosity if nothing else."
tt2528814,"I was dragged to this ""movie"" by a Christian friend who keeps thinking that I""ll finally come around to her religious way of thinking. Jeez, it was worse that I expected. Atheists are portrayed as evil beings who ""hate god"" and are determined to convert Christians. Actually, atheists do not ""hate"" god; god is simply something they don't believe exists. As to forcing their way of thinking on anyone, the movie has it backwards. It's Christian zealots who demand that everyone think like them. Most atheists - those that I know anyway - are happy to let others believe as they wish as long as they don't force their ""values"" on the rest of us. As to production values, etc., the film is pretty basic. The lead actor over-emotes and the supporting cast of Kevin Sorbo and Dean Cain look pretty silly. The plot is pretty much what you'd think. Thoughtful friends shouldn't let friends see this piece of propaganda: it has no basis in reality. As to Christians, knock yourself out. Like Fox News, it's been produced to reinforce your preconceptions without actually presenting another point of view in anything resembling a thoughtful way."
tt2528814,"You know when a movie made by Christians is about religion, it's going to demonize secularism. It makes out that Morality is entirely exclusive to Christianity and that without God, there is no point in being moral, which is just ridiculous. It makes every non-Christian look either evil or stupid, which is just insulting. It is just propaganda, no way around it, it's trying to make Christianity look perfect when it isn't and it's trying to make secularism and any other religion look evil and immoral. It's almost like this movie was made Christians who knew absolutely nothing about their own faith and of other beliefs. It's a new low for cinema, it's upsetting to think that this movie was allowed to be made."
tt2528814,"The ways this film treats all atheists is the rough equivalent of a film treating all Christians as Fred Phelps clones.It's a thoughtless, unintelligent film whose only appeal is that it preaches to the choir. It presents the world in the most one- dimensional, black-and-white format I've ever seen.And if anyone sees it fit to jump in and criticize me for being biased against the film: I have several friends who are very sincere and devout Christians. I have the utmost respect for their beliefs, and would never try to convert them.THEY have even said that this film is the pinnacle of stupidity, and that it misrepresents their religious beliefs entirely.Skip it."
tt2528814,"I'm not a Christian but I watched this movie and I got a big kick out of it. Not in the way that the producers probably intended, but I thought it was entertaining.Of course this movie is complete hogwash with conversations in the script that would never ever happen in real life. OK, where do I begin? As mentioned elsewhere on this page, atheists, for the most part, don't ""hate"" God...that would be like hating Santa Claus. And the argument that one can't be moral without Christianity...gimme a break. Has anyone ever heard of Aristotle? He wrote a book about ethics long before Christ trod the Earth. And finally, no professor would ever act like Kevin Sorbo's character. Anyone with a truly inquisitive mind would welcome a debate and no, Stephen Hawking is not consider ""infallible."" You can't just bring up Hawking's name as proof of anything. Never been done. Never.Overall, this movie is about bashing what the producers see as militant atheism and secularism. Richard Dawkins is mentioned several times. And why anyone would get their life's philosophy from a dude who sells duck callers on TV I'll never understand. If you enjoy overwrought, wrong-headed religious melodrama with a sort of a dark and surprisingly nasty undertone, then God's Not Dead is for you."
tt2528814,"I am not sure why all the reviews are so negative. This movie has been able to do one of the most amazing things I have ever witnessed. It is so bad and ridiculous that it has actually managed to unite Atheists and Christians alike in being both offended and disgusted at the same thing. Do you know how difficult that actually is? Come on people, you should be happy that it one thing has proved that we all can get along and hate the same thing, arm and arm... LOL!! I mean this movie (and I use that term loosely) is so bad that it really has me wondering what the creator of this movie was thinking. I mean overly cliché'd stereotypes, mixed in with a ridiculous premise, coupled with even more ridiculous subplots. All culminating around the premise of a professor at a University requesting to do something that I am pretty sure would be deemed illegal and I have never come across or even heard of, someone making people sign a paper denouncing their religious faith. My favorite part is they then allow this kid to argue points of which in this day and age people can watch on any youtube clip, probably have already come to their own conclusions and doesn't answer anything on either side, in my opinion. So the fact that everyone thinks this movie is preposterous in a united front is quite amazing, and if that was the intent of the creator of this movie, then he is a genius!!"
tt2528814,"Kevin Sorbo gave a pretty decent performance as the atheist professor. Along with this, Shane Harper turned in a solid performance as the college student challenged by his professor. The multiple story lines which intersect in the film was a nice touch as well. Many reviews I've read are pretty hard on this film and it's plot. This is confusing as the title pretty much gives the thesis of the movie away. Taking the film for the one-sided argument that it was meant to be, I found it to be entertaining and engaging. I thought the interaction between the protagonist and the antagonist was plausible and the dialogue realistic enough to suspend disbelief and be taken into the story. I thought the pace of the movie was just right."
tt2528814,"So first of all, in God's Not Dead, let's get this out of the way first: this is not how a college classroom works. As someone who has now been teaching in a college for over a year now, I've seen first-hand how students act and react to things, and more importantly how professors act. Maybe this character that Kevin Sorbo plays has tenure, maybe he's an 'untouchable' in Academia. But how this class operates - how he firmly puts it to these students that they must write down on the first day of class on a piece of paper 'God is Dead' and that counts as 30% of their grade - is just stupid and illogical off the bat. What goal is this professor looking for? Does he want a *sincere* answer from these students? The conflict comes that one student (named Josh Wheaton... like uh, Joss Whedon, I guess for some reason) challenges the professor by not writing it, not because of any logic about how a classroom works, but because he's a Christian and won't give in. So then an entire debate is set up - forget a class being taught or lessons - between the theist side and atheist side.This isn't to say the movie doesn't pour on its message thicker than syrup on a dozen stacks of pancakes. But even having to think about this shows that the director and writers here don't care about having actual, human characters here. Not really. They have some kinds of shades of what a person might be like, like, well, words and thoughts and things, but there isn't much past: this side believes, and this side doesn't believe, and they really, deep down, don't believe because either someone in their family died (the professor) or may be dying soon (the reporter woman, who by the way gets a very hackneyed scene where an a-hole boyfriend breaks up with her after her cancer news).It would be one thing if it was just this BS straw-man back-and-forth in front of a plastic classroom full of stick figures for these mouth-pieces to talk (and that's what they are, make no mistake about that, unless you're already coming to this as the heavily-converted). It's really in the structure of something like Crash, a multi-character 'tableau' that has some very minor connections to some of the characters - it all comes together, naturally, at a Christian rock concert in the last third. There's multiple crappy plots to go along with the main 'plot' of the freshman student and the professor, including the local pastor/preacher/whatever and a car that won't start (the rental car guy that comes is meant to bring the one 'joke' that falls flat), and a Muslim girl and her strict father, who we know NOTHING about and decides to go for Jesus and gets slapped and kicked out of her house.Who is she? What about the reporter, who we maybe know a little more about due to her sorta-storyline with cancer and interviewing a guy from Duck Dynasty (huh) and then later in a prayer circle with the Christian rock group at the end. She has just the shades of anything like real motivation, past ""I'm going to die, that sucks."" And what about the professor's girlfriend, who is made to look like a doormat to her boyfriend (always an a-hole, even up until the very end of the film), and says she is a Christian but has little to really say against her super-Athiest-Dogmatic man? So many of these scenes, for all of the characters, are just springboards so that people can get into these arguments and talks about God and faith that are, for lack of a better or more original expression, preach to the choir: you already know coming to this that God exists, right? Then get ready for some mighty Christian rock (ugh) and messages from certain intellectuals in lecture-form about this. You know God doesn't exist? Or are unsure? Well...There's no middle ground here, no other voice or nothing to make for any real spot for ambiguity. And even with the sense of these students really having their own thoughts or expressions in the class there's basically nothing (one student, out of the blue, quotes Richard Dawkins like she knows it off the back of her hand, at the start of a 101 Philosophy class, and another, the Chinese student, kind of a supporting character, has a moment with his far-away dad who says simply 'yes, the professor says God exists, He exists, go away'). Ultimately it comes down to the script for a lot of these problems, and how it's really, aside from having badly written characters and bad dialog and not necessarily bad filmmaking but bland direction (and among the actors, only Kevin Sorbo doesn't look there to drone on with little emotion), it's an anti-intellectual film. It's epitomized in the whole 'hook' of the college classroom, which is (to repeat myself) how a classroom works, on any level.So near the end, if you're still enraptured by the message and praising Jesus as people become converted and songs are sung and the Duck Dynasty guy returns (?) then have at it. But as a film, as a story, with characters, and a meaningful message, it's as subtle as an anvil dropped Wile E Coyote."
tt2528814,"Overall the movie was wonderful. I was hesitant to take my two young children, 8 and 9, but we decided to go as a family. I was fearful of taking them because they have only recently accepted Christ as their savior and was unsure how they would react to hearing arguments from the other side. I have to say I greatly underestimated their understanding. When my daughter informed me the star of the movie was from one of her Disney shows, I just knew they would be alright.What was awesome about this movie was the realism. In my life I have come in contact with people represented by each character in the movie. Especially the narcissistic professor who corrupts data to get across a particular anti-Christian point of view. The scene at the house party struck me as a perfect way to represent the arrogance and corruption of a leftist educational system that self-validates their denial of the truths of our creator. Even the melancholy of the believer who doesn't know why God has placed him in a particular service was powerfully displayed by the pastor who couldn't get his rental car straightened out. And the attitude of his contemporary from a more challenging home land.At the end of the movie my son asked me why do they hate God so much? It dawns on me that I don't have the right answers for him yet, but our family is thankful for a movie that has him curious. Maybe he will be of the generation that reverses that ugly trend."
tt2528814,"God's Not Dead delves deeper into the complex reality of life for people in this postmodern world than its predecessors in the evangelical Protestant big-screen efforts. God's Not Dead definitely represents a step up in quality over films such as Facing the Giants, Fireproof, and Courageous. A higher budget brought an overall improvement in the cinema experience for the viewer. That and stronger acting and sharper editing drove along this evangelical Protestant film's most obvious upgrade to this reviewer: the genuine development of more characters.Could that have been even stronger? Yes. Could it have been a bit more balanced? Yes. But I applaud the makers of God's Not Dead for exploring real human complexities, and that's a river most evangelical Protestants are reluctant if not downright unwilling to swim. In God's Not Dead, for example, we see a university coed raised Muslim converting to Christianity, and, while her father is violent in his reaction to learning of his daughter's conversion, both before that scene and at the end of that scene, we see a human dad sincerely striving to raise his children as best he can and his genuine disappointment over his daughter's loss of the faith of her upbringing. What Christian cannot have empathy with this father, despite a difference in beliefs? Another example is the sudden disappearance from the movie of a female character that played an important supporting role in the first half of the film. The reason for the disappearance demonstrates that while immersing teens in church youth group activities can be very beneficial in faith development, genuine and abiding faith is shaped through real-time life experiences. In other words, for this female character, her Christianity was as external as her overly thick makeup.And many of the other characters were not left at the superficial level, we actually found out what made them tick, what drove them to be the way they are.The classroom discussions over the existence of God can spur viewers, no matter their beliefs, to investigate for themselves and perhaps be less afraid of opposing viewpoints.All that said, the movie's makers couldn't help themselves in forcing piecing of the puzzle by going to the evangelical Protestant ""Come to Jesus"" solution in unrealistic settings that stretch the imagination. That they left a few developed characters ""unsaved"" contributes to a more -- notice I said more -- realistic feel about this flick than about many others in this genre.For the genuine effort made in developing characters and presenting a more realistic setting for people wrestling with the God question in their lives, I give God's Not Dead a passing grade of 7 and urge people to attend this movie."
tt2528814,"Refreshing to see a Christian-based movie that is done with quality writing/acting/production. I went to support the movie but expecting the same old lame and wooden 'Christian' movie experience, but came away very impressed with all aspects.A little pointed, of course, but not far off what kids would face in today's university at times. Love the comments/reviews here so angry at touching on the raw nerves of truth. Nice that the 'artistic license' is on the other foot for one time (in movies/TV/etc)...and just listen to the howls (see other reviews here).The flow and point of the movie wasn't actually heavy-handed (sensitive raw nerves excluded), but went to the point of Christianity and the God-given right of freewill, along the way refuting the sophomoric-yet-ultimate 'show-stopper' argument of moralistic-atheists, 'How can a God who is (considered) good allow bad?'.Overall, accomplishes the point of any good movie... fine acting/writing, and promotes thought and discussion."
tt2528814,"I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. Originally a friend and I went to support the film, not really sure we would like it all that much. But wow! What a great story! There is more going on than the ads portray, with many different characters and situations of all kinds. There are some clunky scenes that weren't well-edited, but overall it's a good story not too far outside the realm of reality.The acting was better than I expected it to be based on other comments and reviews. I've concluded that most viewers are over-rating or under-rating the movie, depending on their perspective on God. As a Christian, of course my friend and I had an appreciation for the subject matter, but as movie-lovers we also enjoyed the film."
tt2528814,"And that student was.....Albert Einstein!We've all read those contrived chain e-mails where a professor and student get into a philosophical debate, usually over religion or partisan politics, where the student ""cleverly"" upends the professor using some highly-questionable logic, right? Well, this is one of those e-mails stretched out almost two hours, with a couple of meaningless subplots thrown in and some free publicity for a popular musical group. Yes, someone took one of those apologetics arguments and made a movie out of it. The premise is built on a falsehood, but a certain sect of this country will eat it up.Do not go to this movie expecting to be enlightened about belief or a lack thereof. This is just one 113-minute-long logical fallacy."
tt4003066,OVERACTED ACTRESS .. DISASTER MOVIEDon't waste your time .. in the 80's and 90's .. in Latin America .. they wrote excellent scripts and productions .. with a similar story .. where .. an overweight woman .. with self-esteem on the ground .. and then .. She loses weight .. and turns into a beautiful woman .. but in this movie .. the actress did not change her appearance much ..
tt4003066,I'm really sorry because of i can not give a minus score. I mean even zero score is excess for this movie.
tt4003066,Did not like it. I mean this was suppose to be a funny movie and I didn't laugh even once. The actress over acted to create such an non real character... safe your time and watch something else
tt4003066,"Cool, nice and great Turkish film!! With many talented - famous actors, who are very funny and you can't stop laughing. The moral of the film is that maybe you have to check deeper to yourself and see what you like most and not what the others say."
tt4003066,"Gupse Ozay was very promising when she first became famous. Everyone thought that Gupse Ozay would be the new Gulse Birsel. Unfortunately, this movie proved that it couldn't happen. This movie is so bad. Even any episode of Yalan Dunya is better, funnier and more entertaining. Some criticized this movie by comparing it to Recep ivedik. It was said that this movie is ""the female version of Recep ivedik"". Both movies are based on off-the-wall jokes. But at least there are funny moments in Recep ivedik. I didn't laugh at all in this movie. I didn't even smile. Make better use of your time and watch something else. They also made the second version of this movie. It doesn't make any sense."
tt4003066,"I really thought this was just going to be too dumb to withstand, but I was pleasantly surprised. Ok, it was really silly and ridiculous and goofy and exaggerated, but I have to say it was funny and cute too. And speaking of cute, WOW, that Baris Arduc is extremely cute! And I was really happy to see a few other familiar and beloved faces. I enjoyed the performances of Cihan Ercan and also Zeynep Camci. I love them from other projects and was so happy to see them again. Props to Gupsay Ozay. She portrayed her character to the hilt, and was completely ridiculous.The only criticism I would have is that I am not a fan of dirty words, nor sexual connotations. That gross humor was not funny to me, but otherwise, I did enjoy this comedy."
tt4003066,"Deliha is a little gauche, very plain but doesn't lack in confidence. I watched this movie by chance on a Turkish Airlines flight and was entertained right from the opening scene where the character shines. It makes sense that the movie was built around the character. The story itself loses a little steam towards the end for me but it will nevertheless amuse you. It's great to discover Turkish cinema can produce such good comedies, miles away from the formulaic Hollywood Rom Coms and the language or cultural barriers are not a problem in appreciating Deliha.Highly recommended, something funny, something different!"
tt4003066,"I tried to tolerate and finish it but every 10 minutes it is repeating itself. So I quit at the middleNo fun, scenes are so bad at some point you suprised how bad they were.I come here to warn people not to waste time."
tt4003066,WASTE OF TIME. ONE OF THE WORST FILM EVER. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.
tt4003066,Smart and very funny! Very nice characters! Laughed many times watching it... and was laughing even later remembering some of the scenes!
tt4003066,"Loved it. Came here for Baris Arduc but what a surprise I got. Amazing story, great writing from Gupse.If you are in a bad mood, GO AND WATCH THIS MOVIE. It will change your mood 100%.Realistic, hilarious, a show stealer. Çok Onu Sevdim <3"
tt4003066,"First I found it silly, then couldn't stop watching it😂👍
I'm looking forward to watching Deliha2"
tt4003066,"I usually never watch comedies because I hate the humour. This one, I watched it on Netflix and I got obsessed with it. The lead actress is very fresh and charming and everyone else is also colorful and entertaining and play the roles well. I recommend this movie to everyone I know who asks me for suggestions on what to watch. It also has very nice score, and I loved the bits where Fevzi plays the really sad music with over the top macabre lyrics, it reminded me of street musicians in my town, so realistic! And the scene with the police, too. Generally all the characters feel like people we could meet in real life and this I like very much."
tt4680196,"I made it through this movie only to ask myself ""why"" at the end. The script is unfocused and never seems to develop a coherent theme. There are two psychic sisters who link up with a Jewish film maker. The anti semitism in this film is hohum. The psychic portion is a soporific. Arrow jewelry and bobby pins are sprinkled throughout the film for some reason. The cinematographer must be in love with Portman since the best parts of this movie are of Nat in many guises. Planetarium is in French. The actors speak clearly and the dialogue is slow. Maybe that's why I stuck with it. A good chance to practice my language skills. I can't recommend this film."
tt4680196,"The movie, despite being beautifully shot, was boring. Natalie Portman and Lilly-Rose Depp were both great in the film, Lilly-Rose Depp especially, but sadly their great acting, and good cinematography, the plot was so boring that I could barely force myself to stay awake. Covering the story of two sisters who can communicate with the dead, this movie starts with promise. The mystery of their ability, and the stellar performances from the two lead actresses carry you through the first half hour or so, but quickly their good performances are over shadowed by the bad performances from the supporting European actors, most of who were heavily accented and clearly didn't speak french as their first language. I waited over an hour in pouring rain at TIFF to see this film and regret every second of time wasted waiting and watching. Do not recommend this movie for anyone"
tt4680196,"What this movie needs is more SUBSTANCE! We haven't a GHOST of a chance of being drawn into this play, because there is only loosely knit ideas..a faint line outlining what may become...something..but what ?? What a waste of talent!! Teaming Ms. Depp and Ms. Portman had me waiting impatiently to view this movie. typically...my favorite actors choose worthwhile projects. Natalie's last couple of endeavors, have left MUCH to be desired.This movie needs to be connected...those dots of ideas need to be connected by story line we can understand and follow. Leave the abstract included....but fill it in with good ol creative action and dialogue that we can follow and appreciate. Better yet..make the story line COMPELLING !! Who better than Ms. Portman and Ms. Depp to carry a compelling theme ?We must give Ms. Portman and Ms. Depp their due for taking such a bold chance..experimenting perhaps. But, ..IF they want to continue to be able to take such risks, they better choose a WINNER next few times round, or their names and past acting performances will be a distant, fond memory. Remember her?...Loved her in that one !"
tt4680196,"I watched the whole film and still have no idea what it's about. It's beautifully shot, but the story is unintelligible."
tt4680196,"So I guess it didn't help that with a cast like this my expectations where quite high. However I felt like there was a lot of cliché a lot of historical approximation about the second world war, the film crisis pre WWII that it felt a bit overdone, as if they didn't wanted to talk about it but did it.. to cover the all thing.. And that's kind of the issue here, I feel like the film was a bit all over the place like a person suffering from ADHD. Too many topics, issue, character... not enough development. The acting was great, the scenario was close to it too but something was off...something seemed too fake..like this scene where they go out celebrating the first snow of the winter "" overdone and clearly..it was some feather and not snow(right??). Or maybe I didn't like it cause all the characters were lost or not found yet ( lily) and that situation seems not appealing to me... Give it a look and let me know about your experience."
tt4680196,"15 minutes into the movie I started to feel unsettled, then I brightened up a bit when I realised I was watching a masterpiece of bad cinema. The story was bizarre and incoherent, the direction was laughable (I did actually laugh at several points), and the editing was performed by a psychopath on speed.Natalie Portman struggled bravely through, but Depp was out-acted by the houseplants. The only good decision the director made was giving her as little to do as possible.This movie could rival 'The Room', achieving cult status because it is so bad. I can honestly say this was the worst movie I've seen in my 60 years on the planet. Even the titles were bad - they were in a font so tiny as to be unreadable. I'm guessing the actors bribed the title guy so that nobody would see their names. I've given it one star for wardrobe, and because I feel sorry for Portman."
tt4680196,"My opinion---""Planetarium"" is a film by Rebecca Zlotowski, we can say that we are in a movie with a rather singular atmosphere, a little enigmatic and fantastic. The movies has the merit of having three talented actors ""Natalie Portman (incredibly efficient and beautiful), Lily-Rose Depp (fascinating) and Emmanuel Salinger (magnificent)"" they knew how to make us feel all their emotions through their roles Respectively. There is a fairly successful plot in a rather special world too. The realization was perfect."
tt4680196,"Movie began ok but just lost me in a ton of different subplots and never ended up tying anything up.
 On top of everything there was so much male nudity and a scene of freakin' porn that made me almost lose my dinner.
 Thanks for nothing parents guide!"
tt4680196,"I almost didn't watch this movie because of the reviews however I am glad I did. At the beginning of the movie we hear Natalie Portman's character Laura say ""People talk about 'before the war.' The thing is, you never know you're living before a war."" This line sets up the subtext for the rest of the movie. You might forget she even said it until the end of the movie if you make it that long but it raises the question ""do we ever really know the significance of the times we are living in?"" I think the way Rebecca Zlotowski weaves the story through this unprecedented time in history is worth reflecting on. There is no simple way to capture everything going on in the 1930s. It was a time of great achievement and innovation. It was also a time that saw the rise of the greatest horrors of the twentieth century. It's in this context that we see these characters making their way through the universe. The film industry is revolutionizing how we see the world and entertainment. It also becomes a medium for scientific knowledge and journalism. Spirituality, which saw seismic changes following the end of the Great War, continues to be challenged by skeptics just like Harry Houdini did in the 20s. But also finds new converts in people looking for hope in the uncertain future. Then we see the rise of anti-semitism, perhaps clear to us now, but was nonetheless overlooked by many people who were otherwise very forward thinking and missed the dangers right before their eyes. And as the movie makes clear it was not just in Germany. There's one quote that I think resonated tone of the movie for me by Fernand Prouvé played by Louis Garrel- ""People say that they write poetry, but it is wrong. It is the poetry writing us."" Art says as much about the observer as it does about the artist. And while the movie is certainly not for everyone, if you give it a chance, you might see it captures the beauty, complexity, ambiguity, and ugliness of these times. Personally I have enjoyed reflecting on how all these elements fit together into this story and why she chose this plot line to explore them. Much has been written about the excellent cast and cinematography but I thought these themes were worth consideration for anyone who might be on the fence about watching it."
tt4680196,"Two American sisters, Laura and Kate Barlow (Natalie Portman and Lily-Rose Deep) tour some theaters in Europe shortly before World War II with a spiritualism number, as one of them is a medium. When they are seen in Paris by André Korben, a film producer (Emmanuel Salinger), he becomes enthusiastic about them and proposes a project to them.Plantarium is one of those films that contains interesting approaches (even intriguing and perverse) and several good ideas but that do not manage to integrate satisfactorily and that end up disintegrating, partly due to their nature, due to an ambiguity that is no longer effective and above all because of its cinematographic realization.We know that a planetarium is a device that projects an illusory sky onto a vault. One of the themes of Rebecca Zlotowski's film is the crossroads between reality and fiction through cinematography (reminiscent of some stories by Horacio Quiroga on the subject) and a reality that in this case is ambiguous and that also seeks the help of parapsychology and the dream. As for the title in Spanish (Connection of love) it alludes to one of the perverse aspects of the plot (perhaps the most original) that remains halfway. And all this in a climate of the time that wants to be emerging but without achieving it at all.Planetarium offers a very good performance by Emmnuel Salinger and as usual in these productions, a beautiful art design."
tt4680196,"Tuned in because of Portman & Depp, but soon saw that there was no real depth to the story. History is always useful..."
tt4680196,"Very interesting characters. The pre WWII event. About two orphan sisters trying to make a living. The best they came up with is to help the people to make contact with their loved ones who had died. So far so successful. Especially when a notable filmmaker takes interest on them, their lives begin to change. Those were what shown to us in the rest of the film. But there comes a complication, especially the bond between the sisters was tested, and followed by the filmmaker's reputation.There were many English dialogues. The casting was so good. The lead three was great. But there's something about the story. Overall, it looked decent, but I don't know that they cinematically well transformed. Looks like a literature kind of tale, yet it was not adapted from any such source. That is what's missing in here. You know, the good writer's perspective. They know how to take the story in a right direction.I felt they messed the conclusion. All the sudden too much had happened. Even the twist did not feel like it was a twist. All the above, there's no strong emotional effect. The middle section was so plain. All I felt was the two sisters struggle. The rest did not make the film shine. Could be one time watchable, but I'm not sure you would like it at the end.5/10"
tt4680196,"The half hour is quite interesting. Two sisters running a seance business in pre WW2 Paris. A man wants to get them into movies and get evidence of proof. So far, so good.The movie then disappears up its own backside, loosing all structure or semblance of a plot or characters.The film seems to become more important than the seance act. So, all that build up for nothing.Characters drift in and out with no purpose or reason, and we are left to drift in a vain hope of what could have been.The movie has wonderful production values that pay homage to Paris setting and is well lit with excellent set decoration.But as for the rest ...no thanks."
tt4680196,"This film recreates the epoch rather credibly. The fact that it is reproducing a real story except for the main subject is something of a side way to bring it up. The true story seems to me to have made a much better film. Maybe the true story is too much of a depressive story to even think of putting it there for people to see. So, in lieu of it, they made this film. Nathalie is certainly the woman to play terrible downfalls. The film is somewhat rendering lightly serious events and this is a bit like real life. The seriousness of the situations often reveals itself after the consequences. And in fact, taking things seriously as they come, is a sure way to get paralysed by everything."
tt4680196,"In Paris of the 1930s reality and illusion combine in myriad ways for visionary American sisters Laura (Natalie Portman) and Kate Barlow. The sisters manage to convince an ingenious and successful film producer, Andre Korben, that they can communicate with the dead and thereby reveal significant truths. Andre convinces the nomadic sisters to stay and star in his new film. As Kate and Laura launch their careers in film they discover different aspects of themselves in romance as well as acting, that place immense strains on their finances, sisterly connection and their new found benefactor even as a looming war – and all the hatreds it invigorates - threatens to envelope them all.The memories, visions and prophecies of Planetarium's characters are beautifully illuminated and invigorated by dream sequences, poems and imagery of snowfall, the night sky filled with stars and twilight. There is wonderful depth and splendor in these machinations. There is a lovely poem about creatures with wings, and the spectacular feeling that sweeps over you when the window is opened and they choose to stay instead of flying away. A main theme of the film, that art, acting and stories - like ghosts - lead us to important truths, is very compelling, yet I wish the links and transitions were clearer in this respect. Natalie Portman's performance is exquisite. She manages emotional ambiguities, such as between hope and bitterness, so well. She delves into the playful sexuality that I loved so much in Black Swan. I wish there were longer and more frequent dream sequences. Seen at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival."
tt4680196,"This is not a real review, it should be understood more as a collection of impressions on the film.A quite nice but also very boring film that tries to be scary and futuristic, but in conclusion it's just a normal little story that tries to be new and compelling but fails quite spectacularly. I really don't know what to say about this film except that the idea is compelling and even some parts of the film are very good but if seen as a whole then it is really terribly boring and it's really a shame because if the film had had more pace it would have been really nice. In conclusion, we don't even know whether to recommend the film or not."
tt4806012,"I found this one on Netflix and was in a ""whatever works"" mood. So I decided..porque no..Watch this one. It is a silly movie and overall I actually enjoyed it. I did not know what to expect, because I rarely watch Spanish movies. It is not the world's greatest comedy/nor acting, but I still think they managed to make it enjoyable. So - if you are in the same mood as me or just want to watch something easy going, this might be a good option. It is somewhat a low budget movie, but that also makes it silly. What I do like about movies (lets say from Spain), is that the actors are unknown for me (even if they are well known from TV etc in their own country)..and thats a good thing. I cant even tell you how fed up I am with the same overused actors in movies. No names mentioned, no names forgotten. Try it and you might find yourself enjoying yourself for 1.5 hour=)"

Think POLICE ACADEMY with better production values.The cast are appealing and the film making spot on so we can forgive HEROES WANTED for all the jokes that misfire."
tt4806012,Watching this movie was a complete waste of time. The worst of the worst. All good rates must be from friends and family.
tt4806012,"With a title like this I was half expecting a parody of the very popular Brazilian movies ""Tropa de Elite"" (also known as Elite Squad around the world, the first of the two movies winning the Golden Bear at the Berlinale). Having said that, this is a movie from Spain, so that alone should have been a giveaway, that my suspicion was completely wrong in the first place.Someone has compared this to Police Academy though and I reckon that is a far better thing to say and expect. While this has a much higher budget than the movies from the 80s, this doesn't mean that it is way superior. I'd even argue that most have fond memories of the Police Academy franchise. Whatever the case, I've seen way worse movies than this being much more successful. So while this isn't really great, I'd say ""not guilty"" (when it comes to the charge of not being funny)"
tt4806012,"Though many people may think that all movies that foreign countries make are art house dramas, some countries do make populist cinema, Spain being one of them. This particular Spanish effort is a comedy, and you may wonder if it manages to be funny. Well, a lot of the humor may fall flat for people outside of Spain, because often the movie's humor depends on the viewer knowing a lot about Spanish culture and history. And there are some obvious gags that I think fall flat no matter what culture you come from. But while there are a number of misfired gags, there are still a number of gags that, while not laugh out loud funny, will have you smiling or chuckling a little. The actors in the cast are likable, the movie does click along at an acceptable pace, and there are no boring bits. While I wouldn't say this movie is funny enough to actively seek out, if you come across it on Netflix on a slow day as I did, it does pass the time in an agreeable manner."
tt4806012,Actors and actresses superb. The script is quite fun but sometimes a bit boring. Anyway I would watch again.
tt4806012,"Irreverant, in the tradition of Airplane. It would be hard to describe without giving too much away. It's been in my to watch list for ages, because it was in Spanish and I needed the practice for my Duolingo. So glad I watched it in the end on a rainy dull day because the laughter lightened my mood."
tt4806012,"Level 1: A slap-stick, physical comedy of surprises, cleaver dialog (including cleaver english subtitles), engaging characters all well presented by the director and actors.
Level 2: Lots of insider jokes, characterizations and situations for those familiar with cultural and political aspects of today's Spain. (As an American, I made good use of watching along with someone who knows a lot about Spain.)
Level 3: A shockingly non-PC movie for the American viewer. The extent of political correctness in the U.S. would make it impossible to make a movie like this in the U.S. and provided this American viewer with a distinct reminder of the enjoyment factor of freedom. Refreshing! Americans should see this film even if they have to use this fast-paced presentation to learn of the seemingly conflicting cultures within Spain at the same time enjoying the rusulting humor.I rarely laugh out loud watching a film at home. It happened many times with movie. Many times I went back to see the joke again--some were so funny, shocking and refreshing."
tt5059406,"Gothic horror is such a dismally overlooked genre, so many fascinating concepts to draw in, many many tales, so when one comes along, such as this, my curiosity and anticipation were high. Definitely positives can be taken, it is beautifully told, Ruth Wilson is a superb actress and story teller. The production values are strong, the story intriguing, but, those strong elements are somehow given a disservice by the execution, the delivery is meant to be slow deliberately, but is done in a way that makes the film boring, annoyingly it never seems to come to life, and the ending is woefully inadequate. Maybe my expectations were too high, this was disappointing. 5/10"
tt5059406,"On its surface, it would be very easy to outright dismiss writer/director Osgood Perkins' atmospheric Gothic-horror picture ""I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House."" And for good reason. The film is an exercise in deliberation. But it is an exercise that goes too far too often, and suffers for it. Without doubt, most viewers who choose to indulge in viewing it will find their minds wandering and themselves nodding off within the first act because the film's pacing and structure lend to an overpowering sense of tedium and dullness. This is without doubt the very definition of a ""slow burn."" It both literally and figuratively crawls from scene to scene, with dialog delivered in drawn out whispers and characters moving as if filmed in slow motion at all times. Even as someone with a great bit of patience for films such as this, I found myself checking my phone more times than I'd like to admit.And yet... I never felt the urge to stop watching. Because despite this glaring issue, the craftsmanship and storytelling is completely enthralling and endlessly engaging, with a grand old-fashioned vibe that I couldn't help but be pulled into from the very first scene. In many ways, it reminded me of the campfire ghost stories of old, classic Hollywood creep-fests of the 50's and 60's and the ancient photographs of ghosts and spirits you stumble across when you research the supernatural. So much of the film is so lovingly assembled to tell a classic tale of the unknown that I couldn't help but watch it start-to-finish... even when it very nearly put me to sleep more than once.The film follows the tale of a lonely and easily frightened young woman called Lily (Ruth Wilson), who is hired to serve as a live-in caregiver to retired author Iris Blum (Paula Prentiss) in her final years. But as the film informs us through a wonderfully poetic opening narration, Lily's future is a dark one- she tells us that within the year, she will be dead, and we will be witness to the events that lead up to her passing. And the film follows just what happened, as Lily is haunted by strange sounds and visions and begins to suspect that there is something very wrong in the home of Iris Blum. Something that may be connected to her most popular novella- a tale of horror called ""The Lady in the Walls.""The strengths of the film lay in Perkins capable hands as a storyteller. The film is absolutely stunning to behold, with an intriguing premise that keeps you thoroughly invested and some of the most gorgeous cinematography in some time, despite the film taking place almost entirely inside of a single house. The expert sense of composition and movement that Perkins excels at builds and maintains a startling and sometimes overwhelming sense of dread and pure guttural terror, and his keen use of carefully calculated jumps will illicit some serious creeps for open minded horror fans. He also wisely keeps the film both focused but also vague, giving it a bit of a mystery flair that will keep you wondering what will come next. And of course, as mentioned before, the dialog and structure of the film is pure poetry. Very classy work.But it comes at a cost. That being the frankly bizarre sense of pacing that is a result of the calm, calculated storytelling. I hate to say it, but this is a phenomenal short film that is nearly destroyed because it is slowly (and arguably needlessly) dragged to feature length to the point of hilarity and then frustration. There's no good reason this same film could not have been told in a much shorter span of time. A forty minute short-subject with this exact same script and these exact same shots would have been a revelation of pure terror. But padding it out to near ninety minutes is nearly a kiss of death to the entire project. There's only so long you can see Wilson slowly wandering down the hallways moving at a pace of only one step every ten seconds before you feel a yawn arising... only so many times the camera can linger eerily on the same open doorway while slowly zooming in for effect before it starts to feel empty... only so many times you can hear the same droning creaks of floorboards for minutes on end before it loses effect. The pacing is nearly a disaster.As it stands, it's almost impossible to recommend ""I Am the Pretty thing That Lives in the House"" to any potential audience. It's beautiful. Stunning even. And a wonderful ghost story told in an unconventional fashion. But it comes at the cost of pacing. I can see too many people being too bored of it to suggest it to anyone outside of the most forgiving of genre fans. But if you prefer and enjoy deliberate horror. If you relish in the slow-burn of features like ""The Witch"" and ""The Shining."" You might get something out of it. I give it an above average 6 out of 10. A beautiful but troubled work of art."
tt5059406,"The acting was subtle and well done, the story was intriguing (if its potential was never fully met), and the near silent tone of the movie was a strength more than a drawback. There will be unanswered questions, and that annoys a lot of people. If you are like me and prefer to leave with questions, you will appreciate this flick more. I don't think the criticism calling it boring it fair. A lot is going on in the background if you pay attention. It reminds me of Victorian ghost stories. Not everything has to be extreme to be worth viewing. All in all it has its problems, but worth watching if you don't mind a slow build."
tt5059406,"Wow, is this movie ever pretty. Aptly named. I was captured by the very first scene of the girl in the dress. Like a painting from the futurism style, it blends movement and motion into a final still, out of focus, and it looks stunning on the mostly black big screen. All of this is overlayed with narration that is simply perfectly spoken (which is consistent for the film, a beautiful read), but more importantly beautifully written. The narration, which comprises most of the spoken lines of the film, is more a poem than a movie script, and I appreciated it for it. The image was a painting, the words were literature, as a whole the film was successful as an art piece.It revolves around a live-in nurse moving into a house to care for an old author who used to write horror books. The nurse starts experiencing subtle signs of a haunting, and finds a strange connection between what is happening to her and one of the author's most famous books. As an idea, it was the kind of quiet horror I love, channeling fear through the uncanny, like old written weird fiction (my mind took me back to reading the Yellow Wallpaper by Gilman). Fear is not even the right word, as nothing about the film is scary, really. More like a feeling of wrongness with the world, an existential dread of sorts. Not to detract from the beauty of the art on display, which was anything but shallow, but the plot itself unfortunately was. Pretty, but surface. Only unfinished hints of a story, that relies a bit too heavily on the viewer to fill in the gaps. I am always a fan of ambiguity, and it is almost necessary for me in a horror film (definites tend to disappoint), but there is still a balance to be struck with some concrete details. Osgood Perkins' last film, February, struck the perfect balance between ambiguity and detail, and for that was my favourite horror of 2015. Here, unfortunately, the scale has moved too much in one direction, to the point of feeling unfinished and not entirely satisfying. I also did not love the ending, which is much too close to that of another stunningly subtle recent horror, by one of the most famous current horror directors. Actually, I loved the ending (as a part of the story on display), it fit very well, I just didn't love that I had already seen it so recently. A sad problem of timing. All in all, I can't possibly not recommend The Pretty Thing That Lives in the House, because it is a soul-satisfying kind of pretty, from sound to visuals to acting. But if what you're after is horror (or even a particularly engaging drama), it won't quench that kind of thirst. Only one for beauty."
tt5059406,"The Monologe of lily goes on and on, as is the movie.
Nothing scary about it.
Cheap low budget movie made movie. Netflix, that says all.
Boring as hell.
I don't understand how people could even to consider to give it so many stars."
tt5059406,"I would describe 'I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House' as a Gothic short story (or maybe even a Gothic poem) brought to the screen. But forget about all the tropes and visuals that are associated with this genre, it is instead focused on what for me is the essential element of Gothic literature: The dead are alive. This doesn't seem like much to build a narrative on, and the driving force of ""Pretty"" indeed is not plot, nor characters, nor the solving of a mystery. And while all three things are embedded into its narrative it is first and foremost a tone poem. An important thing about the the-dead-are-alive notion, especially in this film, is that it goes both ways. The living can sense the presence of the dead (AKA ghosts), but the dead actually live on after their death, probably mostly concerned with reliving their past, but they might also be able to sense the living. So who is haunting who?Consequently ""Pretty"" presents a ghost story within a ghost story, to put it in simplified terms. In more concrete terms the plot concerns Lily, a nurse who stays in the house of elderly horror fiction writer Iris Blum, to take care of her until her death, which shouldn't be too far into the future now. But it also wouldn't be too wrong to say that the main character is the house that had a few occupants over the course of its lifetime. I don't mean this in the tired old this-and-that-place-is-like-another-character-in-the-film way, the personality of the house certainly is made up of all the people who lived in it. But writer-director Oz Perkins takes the expression ""If these walls could talk"" and makes it a reality. It is about the people who lived in the house (or more correctly the people who died in it), but for all intents and purposes the main character is the house itself.""Pretty"" starts with nurse Lily's first day at the house and her opening narration tells us that she just turned 28 years old, but that she will never be 29. She talks about death, memory and says ""From where I am now, I can be sure of only a very few things."" One of those things is her name. So right from the beginning we know that Lily (at least Lily as a narrator) is already dead. Logic dictates that what we see on screen are her hazy memories of her short time in the house. Can we trust her words and can we trust what we see? In any case, old Iris Blum doesn't talk much. But she keeps calling Lily by the name of Polly. And Lily seems to sense some ghostly presence in the house. Polly, as we soon learn, is the main character of Blum's most famous novel ""The Lady in the Walls"", a novel of which Blum said it lacks an ending because of ""an obligation to be true to the subject"" for Polly didn't tell Blum about her ending, but Blum tells us that she is convinced that ""as endings go, Polly's was not an especially pretty one."" Incidentally there also slowly emerges an ugly, moldy stain on one of the walls in the house that Lily grows concerned about. Is there some connection? Perkins leaves the viewer in the dark for most of the film's running time about the concrete connections between all the characters, as slow and eventless as the whole thing is it is difficult to keep track of all the points of view. For example Lily isn't the only one whose voice-over we hear, we also hear and see young Blum as she writes the novel, and we hear and see Polly. Those voices also aren't particularly easy to distinguish, and it gets even more complicated when scaredy cat Lily finally dares to pick up ""The Lady in the Walls"" to read at least parts of it, the content of which is told from both Blum's and Polly's point of view. Through the viewer's natural desire to know the answers the film evokes ideas on the way as we contemplate all the possible answers. Did Polly really exist? Is she buried behind the wall? Are Lily and Polly somehow the same person? Is Lily a fictional character altogether? Or is Lily only imagining things? Like a poem or a song it evokes first and foremost a tone, a mood, and sparks ideas of what it might be about. It takes further readings/listens to find that in between all the lines it actually tells a story, a simple story perhaps, but nevertheless a story. And this is actually how 'I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House' worked for me. The tone and the ideas immediately took hold of me, but it took me two viewings to really make sense of the narrative. This isn't without its drawbacks, because frankly it isn't so much difficult to follow because it floods you with information that you need to sort out, on the contrary, it basically is so eventless that it poses a challenge to stay attentive for the whole time. This was, however, clearly a conscious choice by Perkins, and his approach is nothing if not consequential. But it makes criticisms of the film being ""boring"" particularly understandable in this case, ""Pretty"" indeed is very one-note, and unless it is a note you relish or that you learn to relish, it won't be enough for you to satisfyingly get you through a whole feature film.As it turned out after two viewings, the solution to the mystery is quite concrete and surprisingly not at all convoluted. Nevertheless the ending for me is as chilling as it is simple, and it beautifully circles back onto itself, like a chorus that keeps coming back, just what you would expect a story told by a ghost to be."
tt5059406,"A young nurse takes care of elderly author who lives in a haunted house.This film seems to be getting negative responses from people, at least if I take IMDb as any sort of serious guide. At this time (January 2017) it sits at 4.8, which isn't awful but is certainly far from great. Having now seen the film, I find the low rating surprising. The acting is great, and there is nothing wrong with the film as far as technical matters go.My guess is that people have the wrong mindset. The film was promoted by Rue Morgue, among others, and maybe people got caught up in some hype of Oz Perkins or misunderstood. Much like the recent Guillermo del Toro ghost story, people need to see this type of horror (the ""gothic romance"") as different from what they expect. It might be slower and there will be less blood. But it is about creating a mood, which I think this film does rather well."
tt5059406,"When you are told the main character's fate at the beginning of a film, you are naturally left thinking there must be more to the film. Unfortunately this isn't the case here.
There are some eerie early scenes where the build up tension is actually good. The director is clearly good at setting such scenes. These are let down however, by the final scare not being scary at all. For instance, a character screaming at the camera with the viewer not being shown what is so terrifying until the moment is gone, feels like a complete waste of a tense build up to it.
The frequent narration throughout the film makes this feel more like a timid ghost story or Gothic poem more than a horror. This may have been intended, along with the ambiguity of much of the film. But there are too many events open to interpretation to satisfy any viewer. To me this was a waste of time. I would avoid this."
tt5059406,"This story had all the makings of a great spooky mystery. Unfortunately, it did not deliver. It starts with very mysterious theories and possibilities. Then, nothing. It's like going to a steak house and eating a salad with tofu.That's it, it's anemic. It never really tells you why the ghost is there, nor does the ghost appear much.It needs more interaction between the supernatural and the living. It needs a solution and a reckoning with what happened to the couple that disappeared. In other words, it lacks the very basics of any story: who, why, what when, etc. I was really looking forward to this movie because I am so sick of all the stupid slasher flicks. Oh well.Good try."
tt5059406,"A cool creepy story about, well its more about a house than anything else, or more like the creepy things that go on in it. It starts with the arrival of a home care nurse named Lily, and she's there to care for Iris Blum, a horror novelist nearing the end... And seeing that Lily is the ultimate scaredy-cat, moving into an big, very old house, occupied by a horror writer, well seems weird. But Lily goes for it, and as she cares for Iris, Iris starts calling her Polly... a character from one of her novels, The Lady in the Walls, her best known work. Once Lily checks it out, the creepiness begins. I thought it was a good piece of story telling, it splinters off, and tells the tale of Polly, and also the tale of young Iris writing the book... How all three stories intersect was pretty sweet, and a uber creepy narration helped on the creepiness factor of creepy. Filmbufftim on FB."
tt5059406,"Just give it a try, otherwise you will never know that how bad a movie can be.."
tt5059406,"First reviewed on broth of blogs.This movie about a nurse Lily (Ruth Wilson) who comes to take care of an old author, Iris Blum, living alone in a remote house. Iris is almost senile and speaks to Lily only referring to her as Polly. Lily finds out that Polly was Iris's most famous character and she attempts reading one of the books that Iris has written. And something happens.The story is simple enough but is still cryptic. I didn't get a few parts but I don't think I care. It is about the forgotten lives in the house. The movie is poetic (literally) and I quite enjoyed it. Characterization and Acting (C&A)Characterization was done well, I would have probably liked some exposition but I think this movie is supposed to be puzzling. Ruth Wilson plays the part to perfection - scared, vulnerable and alone. She really looks like she is going to have a heart attack anytime. Its totally her show as she probably has 80 minutes screen time of 90 minutes of the movie.Sounds and Effects (S&E)The background of this movie is just mind blowing. It is the scariest I have heard till date. Has this weird ability to spook you as well even if nothing scary is happening. Full points here. There weren't any jump scares and it is all left to your imagination at the end.Cinematography and Visuals (C&V)Like I said the movie is poetic. It is slow, there isn't much of a story but it moves you and creeps you out. They didn't overdo the actual horror which works in the movie's favor. The lighting was great and the setting itself eerie. Great stuff.Direction and Overall (D &O)Overall, the movie looked and sounded great. The acting was really good I thought. Only complaint I have is that maybe it could have had a little more exposition to actually understand some stuff which wasn't clear. So here are my scores:Plot and Script (P&S)- 1Characterization and Acting (C&A) – 1Sounds and Effects (S&E) – 2.0Cinematography and Visuals (C&V) – 1.5Direction and Overall (D &O) – 1Overall Score – 6.5 out of 10Good watch for Halloween 2016! Just be patient, the movie is not as long as its title!!"
tt5059406,"I thought I'd write a review to contrast all the bad ones on here haha. I hate horror films that resort to obvious ghosts, cheap scares and gore - that ruins it for me and makes it not scary. So I'm always on the hunt for a horror that actually scares me. This film absolutely does not resort to those tricks I hate, and it kept me in a paranoid suspense the entire way through. It's a subtle and clever horror, although I will admit it wasn't perfect. Something was slightly off about the storyline I guess. But how it was filmed - and the pace - was brilliant. It will genuinely haunt me I think :-)"
tt5059406,"The curiously titled I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House opened with interesting visuals and fantastic narration, true be told I was gripped from the outset.It tells the story of a nurse who moves in with an old lady who was once a successful author. To say anything more would spoil it, to say anything more would also be difficult as it's rather hard to explain.So as mentioned the visuals were great and the narration solid, sadly the visuals don't last and the narration isn't enough to save the film. Not even remotely.The film is certainly unique but I'm not quite sure who it'll appeal to, certainly not someone seeking a horror. It's an unusual little slow burning tale that had me interested but all the while I waited for it to get going.Alas the movie though charming fails to deliver on any front, at least for me.The Good:Really unique styleGreat narrationBob BalabanThe Bad:Really dullGoes nowhereThings I Learnt From This Movie:Ghosts are made by looking for them but pretending not to see28yrs old? Hahahahahahahahahahahaha NO!"
tt5059406,Watching the grass grow is more exciting than this horrid little thing. Don't waste a second of your pretty little life watching this dreadful movie.
tt5059406,"Sorry, but this was not just bad but hideous. I get that creators/directors tried to show how original,quirky and bohemian this movie is but it was just a cheap kitsch. If you're trying to create ""smart"" movie you've to put more details,have strong characters and follow plot line. In this case, we're having bad beginning with weak leading role and no detailed movie at all. As a consumer I want to get information fast and understand what this movie is talking about in this film I was lost almost full 90minutes. I didn't like anything of this movie, it didn't have anything unique. I can just applause for creators that managed to make useless movie for under 10k$ budget. I would never recommend to watch this film, just don't waste your time and life."
tt5474042,"Please don't get influenced by the negative reviews, #HalfGirlfriend is a pretty decent adaptation of Bhagats bestseller. Most of his stories are absolutely filmi n this story is no exception. Performances by Arjun, Shradha n Vikrant are sincere. Bill Gates plays a small role (yes, u read it right). Shradhas styling is perfect n she looks classy n lovely. ""Phir Bhi Tumko Chaahunga"" by Arijit is a melodious n sentimental number n it stays with you long after the film is over. The film doesn't take sides n doesn't malign the Hindi-speaking community, Possibly, Biharis will be accorded more respect after viewing this film. The concept of ""beti bachao, beti padhao"" is also thrown in for good measure. Rating 3/5."
tt5474042,"Adaptations will just create countless atrocities against Bollywood if they don't know how to execute a consistent screenplay. This movie basically explains everything from cheesy one-liners to cliché romantic factors.So the movie focuses on Madhav Jha, a Bihari who gets admission in St.Stephens. His way of speaking English is poor but good in nature in terms of sports. He falls in love with a rich girl that goes by the name of Riya Sonmani who is also good at basketball. After a match, they become friends but their friendship gets more serious especially when they kiss. After going through a painful phase in terms of family, Riya runs away to New York happily married to someone else and also fulfilling her dream as a musician and Madhav moves back to Bihar. Riya gets divorced and how Madhav tries to win her back even if she is a cancer patient is basically what this film is about.Quite frankly, this movie is an absolute snooze fest. The trailer wasn't interesting which made me least excited for the film but Chetan Bhagat is one of my favorite writers so i had to check this one out. The romantic factors in the movie are as low as his writing. The script itself contains such romance that will mislead you into falling in love. The acting was below my expectations. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives better expressions than Arjun Kapoor in my opinion. Although he was good in Ishaqzaade, but his role as Madhav just couldn't fit the part in a way that I was expecting.Shraddha Kapoor gave a repeat performance than what she did in Baaghi and OK-Jaanu. Although the 1st half, she managed to pull it off well but her innocent face in the end really couldn't justice to the film.The music in the movie is highly average. Baarish and Tumko Chahunga are decent tracks but the rest of the music wasn't good and really not my playlist listener.The direction of the movie was not as good as well as the cinematography which looked highly vintage and less crisp. Mohit Suri gave some good films like Ek-Villain and Aashiqui 2 and bad films and watching this proves that Hamari Adhuri Kahaani and Crook are not the only films he made so this movie counts in that category.Overall, I just couldn't stand this movie although some of the music saved the film but not a fair decision to go see it. Just don't waste your money this weekend and 2 states can do some justice to your weekend because it is a Chetan Bhagat's film."
tt5474042,"Please! Bollywood stop producing such trashes. Hard earned money is valuable. Its not for filling your pockets by producing shits in the name of movies.We must prefer Indian Cinema rather than Bollywood crapes.Nothing practical and sensible we can expect from Bollywood movies(excluding a few). Also a few can act, rest are just show off duffers who knows nothing except glamour and over acting."
tt5474042,"first things first.The Only Chetan Bhagat's novel(ahem..) which was made into a fantastic movie was 5 points someone. 3 idiots was amazing because the story was modified and presented well by Raju Hirani. Every other Chetan Bhagat's work is a disaster. And that disaster turned into a movie is a bigger disaster.Pro Tip: You see Chetan Bhagat's name on something, AVOID IT unless you want to experience severe pain and regret in your life."
tt5474042,"If Mohit Suri's films are known for anything, then it's their soundtrack. The content of the films is usually rundown and uninspiring romance which sometimes even plays with the actors' careers. In this adaptation of Chetan Bhagat's bestselling young adult romantic novel Half Girlfriend, it looks like the thing about soundtrack may also be spiraling down.Madhav (Arjun Kapoor) is a young student from Bihar who gets admitted to a reputable college in Delhi through sports quota. A skilled basketball player and amateur English speaker, Madhav falls head over heels in love with Riya (Shraddha Kapoor). And starts connecting with her with the hope to make her his girlfriend. Riya, herself an ace basketball player, reciprocates his connection requests, but plays mathematics when he pops the question. She says, ""I can be your ""half girlfriend"""" and that she cannot go full. The story then moves forward to expose its undecipherable convoluted elements as Madhav tries to understand what that term really means.The film strictly follows the plot of the 2014 book where Madhav is constantly in Riya's spell and is continuously trying to classify the type of relationship he is in (if at all), especially about which ""half"" he is in. With much attention given to the importance of English-speaking, the plot then suddenly flip flops between Bihar, Delhi, and New York, as the lead characters make rapid life decisions. Even if you do not understand why the characters do what they do, I'm sure you will notice the brand advertisements in every other frame. If one looks closer, the film looks like a 2-hour long advert for MakeMyTrip. And with my mentioning the brand in this review, I am sure the marketing budget of the bludgeoning Indian travels company has paid off.The basic problem with the film is the character development. Arjun is unable to portray the true loverboy that Madhav is. Instead, he behaves like a magician's rabbit, always appearing where you think it would appear - around Riya. Shraddha, on the other hand - typecast, we call know - dilly dallies around in her scholar, fashionable, and affluent Riya character and exudes confusion. There's not a bit of realism in the proceedings, and in the second half, the degree of improbability hits the roof. One may like to call the story contrived, but there's an even better word for it: convoluted. Other big problem - and this one is crucial - is how the film is executed. This film is more of a musical than a steady romantic film - with a song or a montage appearing every five minutes. That is what wrecks the film's entertainment quotient as it fails to construct a proper, seamless storyline.Both the Kapoors put up a below average show here, reminding us that Arjun may not be talented at all. Shraddha's previous films may save her, but the validity has definitely shortened. Seems Biswas looked out of character as Madhav's educationist mother, whereas both Vikrant Massey and Rhea Chakraborty do a fairly good job. The music by various artists is hummable, thanks to Arijit Singh and Anushka Sahaney. Rest of the filmmaking factors are best left unreviewed.All in all, Mohit Suri's latest venture after the 2015 debacle Hamari Adhuri Kahani is worse. The romance is pulpy and unbelievable, for starters, and it's the last thing we are looking for in a year already giving us anxiety through the unpleasant world affairs. It automatically nominates itself to be ranked amongst the worst films of 2017. BOTTOM LINE: Mohit Suri's ""Half Girlfriend"" fails to verify the theorem it so proudly boasts of, because modern love may be crooked, but not preposterous. Do not even read the book!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO"
tt5474042,"Watched on netflix.. liked it ..Its not theater material, and for sure story is predictable..nothing new in it ..so good for at home entertainment..Music is good and so is screenplay ...They could have improved story ... no need to roam around the world for simple story.."
tt5474042,"Highly disappointing performance from lead pair Arjun Kapoor​ and Shraddha Kapoor​.Fake Bhojpuri accent and forceful acting from Arjun Kapoor. After making disastrous Humari Adhoori Kahani, Mohit Suri's pathetic direction made it more horrible romantic movie. Only good performance from Vikrant Massey​, Seema Biswas​ and Rhea Chakraborty​. Music was average.""Phir Bhi Tumko Chaahunga"" and ""Baarish"" were only good for ears. This movie will complete the Hattrick of flop from Shraddha after failure of Rock On 2​ and OK Jaanu​"
tt5474042,It was a sweet one time movie. I watched it on Netflix. Arjun Kapoor's acting was good. The movie was bit of a drag in between but generally good time pass.
tt5474042,Writer is a idiot who writes bullshit. Money got wasted. Even a kid can write better than this idiot Chetan Bhagat. Don't waste money on this. Worst movie story I have even seen. No moral in story. Seems like it should get flop movie award. Writer should get worst writer award. Boring movie of lifetime. I hate the writer most as he is not actually fit for a writer.
tt5474042,"Here's another movie where ½ the viewers love it and ½ hate it. Both groups accurately describe how they felt about the movie. So I'll try to help the reader determine which ½ they should be guided by. Those who hated it seemed to have been expecting a fast moving and very different type of movie and, hence, they were disappointed when their expectations were not met and they vented their frustration in their review.I thought the movie was quite good, albeit not one of the best of all time. I'll address two of the most common complaints from the haters. First, they call it ""slow"". It indeed is NOT a fast paced action thriller. However, for me, it didn't drag, it was just a normal pace and moved right along such as for ""a slice of life"" type film. Also, it was NOT an ""all talk"" movie by any means.Second, they thought the story line was a cliché. Yes, it is a romantic movie about a poor boy who falls for a rich girl - sometimes it's a poor girl who falls for a rich boy - and about the troubles associated with coming from two different classes and especially the problem that the poor one has fitting in with the rich set. This indeed is a very common theme.However, I do strongly disagree with some other criticisms. I think that because the haters found themselves watching the wrong movie genre, they took out their frustrations by criticizing everything including both leads and the director. I have no acting talent, but based on decades of experience, my impression of acting talent has in the past always been on target even when viewing movies from the 1930s & 40s. For those movies, I had not had expectations or knowledge of their reputation, with a few exceptions, but my impression always matched the critics even for the most unexpected. Later, in the mid-60s, I saw Sophia Loren's first performance when she was very young in ""Two Women"" and came out raving about her star power. Similarly, after I saw Natalie Portman in ""Beautiful Girls"" (she had a relatively minor role and was just 14 when filming), I raved to my stage actor son that I just seen a girl who was destined to be one of the top actresses of her generation. To date, I've had no missteps.Anyway, I thought Arjun Kapoor was extremely expressive and exactly what the role called for and he really carried the movie. There are many styles of acting. If one chooses the ""expressive"" style, one can be accused of overacting or being hammy, but if one does it right, like Arjun did, it can be the most effective style for having IMPACT and conveying strong emotions - Arjun's choice and execution reminded me of others whose expressive style won them Oscars! In contrast, Shraddha Kapoor was more restrained as she played a woman with a mystery which the story required be kept mostly under wraps - again, her performance was right on target with the storyline. Finally, I was most impressed by the director, especially for the last half of the movie where his innovative handling of some innovative aspects of this tried and true storyline echoed the creative genius of D. W. Griffith. The movie was not fast paced, but it had depth. Also, I see that of the ""1/2 that loved it"", most echoed my sentiments although they were less verbose."
tt5474042,First you should go with less expectations ...as like Mohit suri's last movie...as this movie let you go to a story with a musical journey.... great music composition by all music directors..the movie hold you rightly.... emotions are very heart touching...direction is good...story is predictable...but must watch movie
tt5474042,"Arjun Kapoor is hopeless. Overacting with his blank face. He was only there because of sob story of nepotism.
Shraddha Kapoor is a promising actress. Genuine expressions and wish her all the best for more films without Arjun Kapoor if she wants to succeed."
tt5474042,"Based on the novel of the same name written by Chetan Bhagat, 'Half Girlfriend' Directed by Mohit Suri is No Heart, All Talk! Despite sincere efforts, this romantic-drama fails to strike a chord. Reason? Poor Writing.'Half Girlfriend' Synopsis: Madhav Jha (A Stilted Arjun Kapoor) meets a girl named Riya (The Gorgeous Shraddha Kapoor) and falls in love. After struggling to convince her to be his girlfriend, she half heartedly agrees to be his ""Half Girlfriend"". 'Half Girlfriend' is about a man's obsession towards a woman who keeps running away from him, due to bizarre reasons. The film is too long & stretched without much feeling. While the first-hour still has a few breezy moments between its leading-pair, the second-hour is very disappointing. Also, the sub-plot, involving Madhav's attempt to educate girls in Patna, Bihar, appears forced. The film aims to be a heart-touching romantic fare, but ends up being barely anything.The Screenplay is poor. I haven't read the novel, but what has come up on the big-screen, is under-whelming. Mohit Suri's Direction is below average. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are fine. Music by Various Artists, is wonderful.Performance-Wise: Arjun needs to loosen up. Though he makes an earnest attempt to portray Madhav & even get the Bihari dialect right, he doesn't leave much of an impression. His act feels monotonous after a point. Shraddha Kapoor is wonderful & looks stunning. Despite being given a half-baked character, she gives her best & is the sole saving grace. Of the supporting cast, Vikrant Massey is sensational as Arjun's friend & Anisa Butt leaves a mark as Vikrant's wife. Rhea Chakraborty looks lovely in a cameo.On the whole, 'Half Girlfriend' is a letdown."
tt5474042,"The movie is extremely disappointing.Acting wise Shraddha is Okay, Arjun is below average.Music is average.The Hindi take was good.The only reason it takes 1 star is because of the Hindi take (that is appreciated) and the song tu thodi der or ther ja."
tt5474042,"Half Girlfriend is a romantic drama film based on the novel of the same name. The film is directed by Mohit Suri. The film stars Arjun Kapoor, Shraddha Kapoor, Vikrant Massey, Seema Biswas and Rhea Chakraborty.A boy from Bihar falls in love with a rich girl from Delhi. He tries to woo her to be his girl-friend and but she agrees to be only his half-girlfriend.I am not very big fan of Indian romantic film primarily because of cliché execution and over melodramatic scenes and this film is no exception.After seeing the star cast of Arjun Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor I wasn't very keen to watch the film but still tried to give it a try because of Mohit Suri but this film turned out to be another terrible made typical Indian romantic film.Screenplay of the film is average and gets slow and dull in between, there are some funny scenes which are boring instead of funny.Acting is pathetic and it's high time that Arjun Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor should leave the film industry and have some pity on the viewers. Vikrant Massey was probably the most talented and impressive of them all. Rhea Chakraborty was torture in her limited screen space and the talent of Seema Biswas was wasted.Climax was average. The film has lot's of emotional and melodramatic scenes but none of the scenes were impactful and doesn't touches the soul.The film has lots of senseless scenes such as in one of the scene the lead actor books a bus ticket through an app and then travels on the roof of the bus, the unnecessary rain scenes. The female lead despite of knowing that male lead is weak in English speaks with him in English regularly whereas she can speak Hindi very well. In one of the other scenes in a party the stewards who came to serve the guest starts clicking selfies with the male lead leaving their work. All these looks fake, unrealistic and forced upon. The only saving grace of the film is it's mesmerizing music.In my opinion you should ignore this torture and spend your valuable time somewhere else."
tt5474042,"Even though the movie got low rating on average, but I liked the movie. It was very a sweet movie. It showed true love still exists! Songs used in here were good too."
tt5474042,"Review for Half Girlfriend just to make up your mind, whether to give it a watch.(Completely Spoiler free) Yes the critics have got it right. Its a really stupid dumb movie but should we care? I think not. Life is supposed to be dumb and stupid and idiotic and chaotic and rarely does it make sense..that's Half-Girlfriend!!! I will go at it step by step. I have to say I am pretty impressed with the lead performances. Arjun Kapoor delivers a brilliant performance. Its pretty damn good. Its a really tough act to pull. He has to play this Bihari guy, dislodge us with his tough guy act yet retain his vulnerability and also balance an effervescent buffoonery. He does it really well. He knows if he goes overboard, it will seem clinched - he knows if he underacts - he will seem dull. He somehow manages to maintain that equilibrium still staying in character. Well done - after Aurangzeb I really enjoyed watching you act. A really intelligent actor - He internalizes this character and then plays it in a way he knows the Indian audience will love it. Shraddha Kapoor is perfect too!!! Lets not talk about her basketball sessions. She is just too feminine - she can't pull off those moments but apart from them - she again has a really difficult act to follow playing this rich sophisticated girl and mouth some truly atrocious dialogues - Come on - "" I can be your Half Girlfriend"" - Its got to be one of the most inane ridiculous words an actress has to say... but when she does it - for a second I felt even I would have been convinced in that situation. That's the hallmark of a great actress. Play a stupid character in a stupid movie yet flesh her out so well that you truly believe she can exist. Then we have Rhea Chakarborty - I just can't stop gushing about her - Sonali Cable is still one of those flawed gems I keep returning to. She has a very sweet beautiful cute screen presence. She lights up the screen every time she enters. I am not going to bore you with a lengthy boring review. The story is like a train-wreck meeting the Titanic but it uses the rich/poor and vernacular/English and Bihar/ROW divide cleverly to keep things moving along. Nothing makes sense, but its that fast hack of a James Hadley Chase first draft - you can't put it down - it begs attention and a lot of the credit goes to Arjun Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor - they invest and engage us so well that we keep on watching the thrash and after a while it seems like Switzerland, though fleeting - you know its an illusion - Its Matrix but still they somehow manage to do it. A pretty OK first half which completely falls apart by the second half only to be resurrected by the final 15 minutes, which seem too rushed. Editing, direction, music - all are pretty sturdy and efficient. I may not watch it again. But it definitely is not a horrid watch!!! There are a lot of things to hate in Half- Girlfriend but there are a few things to love too....and they seem quite close to one's own life, which can be smelt, felt and pondered about. This movie is actually an Ode to all those unattainable starry crushes in the sky, we in College, school or even our initial years of professional life craved for and now they are all settled well in life with kids and a great partner. Yes - to just see them and say to yourself that we loved and lost well!! In the wake of those bittersweet memories the movie does become watchable aided by good performances of two actors bringing their ""A"" game to the proceedings. So ""Stay a little Longer"" - give it a chance - Its not as endearing as Ae Dil E Mushkil but it may grow on you for all that you know."
tt5474042,"Basic problem with this film that it just showcased the incidents of novel without going in depth with emotions. Screenplay does not justify the emotional conflict, turmoil and sweetness inside most of the characters. It just touches the happening then rushes away. You feel it at interval point very well. Love blossoms while playing basketball as it was in novel. You had imagined that male lead is very good with it but in film you clearly feels the male lead is not so handy with it. This is the first point when you get realization that your imagination while reading the book is going to take a bumpy ride. There is a good shot when Ria challenges a difficult ball shoot in basket to Madhav, which he achieves at last shot but neither he or girl are aware of it. It has shown on screen just as blink and miss way. I think if you have not read it then at places you would not understand certain things. Characterization is now well taken care of. Main lead speaks with same accent when he first go to Delhi for education and after being pass out from college and even after 10 month internship abroad. Movie has its moments but I certainly enjoyed more reading it. Movie was made to en-cash novel popularization but if you have vague idea about the climax of novel then second half of movie will be definitely a slow down for you. There are lots of thrill value given on pre climax but if you know the ending then you feel all gimmick unworthy. Approach towards climax is so loud, performance wise as well as treatment wise though novel has all in subtle way. Performance wise Arjun Kapoor is very good. Shraddha Kapoor is impressive especially in emotional scenes. Rhea Chakraborty is good in her brief role in pre climax. Rest all actors are unbalanced. Casting is another drawback of this movie. Music doesn't support this suppose to be romantic movie where romance lost in translation but somehow drama remains. Only 'Thodi De' track offers some melody and emotion."
tt5474042,Movie is awesome. Its worth the time of you love romantic movies. Ignore the negative reviews 🙌🏻👍🏻
tt5474042,"The concept of the movie was pretty boring. The protagonist of the movie is a boy seeking attention and sympathy as he doesn't know English and against him, a really modern girl with terrible family background.Logic is missing from many plot points of the movie. How can a girl with so modern background have so pathetic family especially a pathetic mother like that? How her dad is so successful And rich when he is spending all his time beating his wife. What the movie is trying to say exactly is that those who have money are just pretending with high-class clothes and have really dark things going on in the family which seems impossible, at least for characters in this movie, it seems impossible. Simply Riya's richness could have brought down or they could have shown her from the middle-class family in the movie would have made total sense but the things don't go with her character when she is extremely rich.Vikrant Massey and Shraddha Kapoor are as usual have done a fabulous job. But the story is very wide so even their performance is not able to lift the movie up. So movie according to me was a one-time watch."
tt5474042,"Mohit Suri's Half-Girlfriend is a complete ""FLOP"". The film has a very slow pace and a disastrous second half. This film does not appeal to the audience. On the other hand, Arjun Kapoor's acting is fantastic. But his performance is not an AWARD WINNING performance. The music of the film plays an important role in the film. Without music many scenes of the movie will remain incomplete. Overall the movie will not get good critical acclaim, also this movie will fail to perform well at the box office. MY RATING: 1.5/4"
tt5474042,"'Half Girlfriend' can leave a reviewer at a loss for words. It is regressive, silly and incoherent. There was no chemistry at all between Shraddha Kapoor & Arjun Kapoor and also adding Arjun's dead performance. Neither a compelling tearjerker nor an epic contemporary romance, Half Girlfriend is definitely not the film to celebrate modern love. The only thing which was a saviour to this misfire is its Songs. As always, Arijit did a splendid performance with 'Phir Bhi Tumko Chahunga' and 'Baarish','Tu Thodi der' making it a chartbuster. I would advise to avoid Half Girlfriend and instead watch Hindi Medium in which Irrfan gives another brilliant performanceMy Rating :2/5"
tt4486148,"Shimla Mirchi review :The only reason I sacrificed my precious afternoon nap to travel all the way to suburban Bandra to catch this film which is carrying absolutely no buzz is its director Mr. Ramesh Sippy.As I settled down inside one of the empty audi of G7 multiplex, I was reminded of the veteran directors past glory. Indeed, Ramesh Sippy has achieved immortality with Sholay (1975) - a cinematic masterpiece and the biggest blockbuster of Bollywood so far. For the 80s audience, Sippy re-defined technical brilliance with Shaan (1980), presented the lustrous Dimple Kapadia like no other could in Saagar (1985) and brought two acting legends - Amitabh Bachchan and Dilip Kumar - face to face in Shakti (1982).Having gone downhill since the 90s, Ramesh Sippy hadn't made a film for nearly two decades since his disastrous Zamaana Deewana (1995). Google tells me that even Shimla Mirchi was a long completed film but delayed for close to five years as it didn't find buyers. Sad if true!!Loosely based on the French rom com Beautiful Lies (2010), Shimla Mirchi showcases an about to be divorced mom (Hema Malini) falling for a young lad (Rajkummar Rao) who is actually wooing her daughter (Rakul Preet Singh). The concept doesn't quite fit into the Indian milieu. Sippy's previous home production Nautanki Saala (2013) - inspired from another French film Après Vous (2003) - had similar problem. Ahem!!More woe, the screenplay and dialogues are quite pheeka especially the first half drags at sluggish pace. Sippy spends considerable time in developing his key characters but unfortunately, they don't engage you at all. Technically too, Shimla Mirchi is quite a downer for the high standards Sippy set for himself in the past.Re-uniting with her director of super hits like Andaz (1971), Seeta Aur Geeta (1972) and ofcourse Sholay (1975), Hema Malini lends tremendous dignity to her somewhat bold character. Infact, she steals the show completely. Rakul Preet Singh looks pretty and that's about it. Rajkummar Rao tries to ape Shah Rukh Khan (and this ain't a compliment please)!!!A parting advice : In case you do go, hang on till the end for a surprise appearance by another legend associated with Sippy. Aww that nostalgia!"
tt4486148,"'Shimla Mirchi' begins in a somewhat strong fashion, I found myself interested in the story that it presents. However, by the time the final scenes come around I kinda lost that interest.First, the positives. I like the dynamic between Avi and Naina, it works for the premise. Rajkummar Rao and Rakul Preet Singh come across well together, while Hema Malini does a good job as Rukmini. Decent cast.The plot surrounding the aforementioned three is fun for the first half, though once things become more settled and understood it ends up losing its way - the third act is tiresome, it feels very dragged out.This film has some enjoyable elements to it, with nice locations and solid music, but concludes in a rather dull manner."
tt4486148,"I thought the premise of the movie in the trailer was a real fresh take on romantic comedies. The idea seemed super interesting until I saw the film.While the movie has moments that are funny and kind of cute, I was quite taken aback by the bad performances. A legend like Hema Malini acted like a caricature of her self, Rajkumar Rao tried his best to save the film but sadly the writing, directing and co-actors didn't really help him much. Rakul Preet's character is rather annoying and immature.I wish the movie was as good as the trailer. I'll give the movie a 5 on 10 for the honest effort put forward by Rajkumar Rao."
tt4486148,"Very poor direction,
Very poor screenplay,
Very poor dialogue,
Very poor story,
Very poor acting.I dont blame Rajkummar Ra, bcoz we all know he is very talented actor. All discredit goes to the filmmaker team."
tt4486148,"Subpar acting, below class script on any level. Not even a scenic shot of Shimla to remember. The only way to forget this movie is to watch something even worse! Unfortunately in this case, Shimla mirchi is truly a tough one to beat..."
tt4486148,"Rajkumar rao is really a great actor but maybe he's not a perfect choice for this movie. there is many noticeable points in the movie where you easily say this is the most boring part of this movie, Also this movie has a really really boring and ordinary storyline."
tt4486148,It's a good family entertainer albeit slow in pace. Good to see Hema Malini and Dharmendra together on screen after so long.
tt4486148,"Useless waste of time! No story, bad acting, don't watch this movie even if you have nothing else to do!"
tt4486148,Good movie to watch for after all hema malini's comeback to movies and a romcom entertainer.
tt4486148,It's so awful. A terrible story. The characters are all irrational and utter buffoons. The heroine is a complete psycho with anger management problems. Apparently Rajkummar Rao's character has taken complete leave if his senses and falls in love with her. Hema Malini's character is a pathetic desperate codependent cringy woman. They look entirely nuts in front of Shakti Kapoor which says something since he's typically the overreacting buffoon in movies. Even Rajkummar Rao's inherently wonderful acting ability can't save this trainwreck
tt4486148,"Really good for comedy and smiling.
If you're looking for a comedy movie to watch and keep smiling,you can watch this movie."
tt4486148,"It do not agree that this movie is waste of a time. If you have liked Raj Kumar Rao's romantic acting, this is the movie.It's a soft light hearted romantic movie and Rakulpreet is cute as always.I would recommend to give it one shot!"
tt4486148,I really love and respect Hemamalini and Dharmendra but picture is so slow and badly directed that my score to this movie is only 1.And this score is just for Hemaji and Dharam. There is nothing in the movie. Nothing at all.
tt4486148,"Rakul Preet Singh's acting looked like as if it was dubbed from some another language. Was reminded of the dialogue, ""50 rupay kaat overacting ki wajah se"""
tt4486148,"Rom-Com fans will definitely like this film. The setting is in Shimla - which gives this film a good vibe while watching. Overall, it's just a decent hearth-warming film to watch. The story and screenplay is good enough."
tt4486148,Really bad story and acting. don't waste your time please.
tt4486148,"Movie is nice, natural, relaxing, light, interesting and entertaining,both main artist are good..a family film with some romance"
tt4486148,It's a drag but still bit sweet movie to watch. Actually this movie's trailer gave away the whole story. So you are pretty much watching the same thing over and over again.
tt4486148,I dont understand .... This movie should have been more rated... ....
tt4486148,"I am totally shocked that Ramesh Sippy who gave us such gems in SHOLAY/SHAKTI/SAAGAR has made such a useless movie after being in hibernation for so many years. Besides showing the beautiful parts of Shimla,everything else about this film was total garbage.
This is definitely Ramesh Sippy's worst movie he has ever made. He needs to retire completely from ever making motion pictures ever again.
0/10"
tt4486148,"All the good actors, pretty faces are there in the movie. But storyline is same age-old. Why did you make thus movie..
But then it's alright.. One time watch"
tt4486148,"I really did not expect hema ji and raj kumar to do such a horrible movie , really bad . Rakul is a bad actor sadly she doesn't know how to act in the big screen , the expressions are missing and I feel that she should quit acting ASAP ."
tt6014472,"OK, that's definitely not ASSAULT ON PRECINCT, nor NID DE GUEPES ( WASP NEST), even LES INSOUMIS, starring Richard Berry but on the same scale of GRIDLOCKED or BLACK SITE DELTA, schemes where police stations are under assault, a topic very often seen since John Carpenter's masterpiece, back in 1976. So, yes, it was a pretty good time for me, despite the bad acting and lousy directing. The army of mercenaries is laughable, they all look like football supporters rushing out of the stadium after the match to fight against the other team hooligans. Laughable, but I repeat, the basic scheme is not bad and Michael Jay White pretty good. By the way, I did not get if YES OR NOT, he died in the end. And what about the geek helping the baddies out with his computer...was he wasted or not? I guess so. Thanks Netflix for providing such films. There were so many looking like this one, i don't remember all of them, sorry. One last thing, I appreciated the way the couple of heavies - man and female - are presented, aboard the private jet, talking in a very intellectual way about the origins of the American Civil War, between North and South states taxes...Interesting for this kind of grade B films."
tt6014472,"Eh yes, what a time it has come when films like this from low-budget B productions are becoming more interesting then new high-quality expensive modern films and series polluted by the woke trend. Although this is an already seen topic and there are a number of films very similar, this one still has its own dose of authenticity (a very small dose but it does). Acting is not the best, let's just say the atmosphere is not relaxed at least it seems so to me like that. Visually and sound it's not exactly the best, the shooting scenes are also pretty bad. The fight scenes and martial arts that run through the film aren't really bad, they're not superb either, but they're at a decent level. You know what, as such and despite all of the above it's again better than all the new expensive crap poisoned by the woke trend."
tt6014472,"Meeting every single cliché from lingerie wearing fighting evil women, over stupidly ridiculous tries to depict 'hackers' - BTW, imitating Microsoft Windows isn't a step in the right direction up to the 'love story' happy end (despite the fact that a dozen of his closest friends just died).I actually have no words; that's how bad of a movie this is."
tt6014472,"What do you get when you assemble an amateur director and writers? S.W.A.T.: Under SiegeSure this is a C-list, low production independent film, but it could have been much better, at least in a few areas. It seemed this was more of a failed low budget TV show production.The story: done thousands of times - this being one of the worst The directing: amateur hour (and a half - run time). I have seen worse, but this film needed strong directing to get over all the other humps, and it wasn't there. The score: terrible. So bad in fact I noticed it every single time, and it did nothing to the scene but annoy me. Was it me, or did they try to get some of the original SWAT TV show jingle in there? The acting: atrocious - every single actor. Partial blame to the director, screenplay and casting director (see below). The editing: was there any? Where there was (fight scenes), it was too soon or too late. And for the first time, I will review two categories I've never reviewed before... casting & action choreography.Casting: There was not even one actor that fit their character, especially the SWAT team. Since when are there that many women on any one SWAT team? Adrianne Palicki was the worst in her role, the most unconvincing, especially as the sexy (why?) Captain (fail). And Michael Jai White did not belong in this film, I could not stand that fake overly-deep voice he was trying to pull off.Action Choreography (fight and gun-fight scenes ): the worst I have ever seen. Add to the fact the amateur directing and really bad editing, all the fight scenes were way too long and very fake and unconvincing. Michael Jai White is getting too old and out of shape for these type of films... he's no Jackie Chan, that's for sure. The girl cat-fight was the worst.I expected more and got much less. Thank God it was only 1:29 min long. Don't waste your time with this unless you're really bored. Rating this film on its merits of a C-grade indie film, it's still only a 3/10."
tt6014472,"An absolutely abysmal movie, I have nothing good to say at all about it -it has diabolical acting, script and action sequences - the lead man gets knocked out 3 times I think, the whole thing is laughable and if I was one of the ""actors"" in this film (and I use the term loosely) I would be ashamed to put it on my CV. Avoid like the plague."
tt6014472,"Worst movie I've ever seen. The story, the acting, the shoting, omg, can't belive someone got paid for making this. Don't watch it. Move on, find another one."
tt6014472,"Reasonable action, one or two twists, satisfactory encore. A good movie when one wants to relax and enjoy"
tt6014472,"Even though this cheap exercise was shot in Canada pretending to be somewhere Stateside, the clichés are in abundance ! The villian is British (as usual), the SWAT squad are liberally multi-ethnic (no Native American here though !), they never have a meal or coffee or go for a poop, they stand discussing strategies with th wanted dude for ages (cheaper than action !) .... I could go on but I am fed up with all of it !! So you make your choice ..."
tt6014472,"The movie lack of numerous characters, may be a low budget movie but it goes straight to the point. The movie has 1 topic and stays on track on that topic. Maybe that's why some people doesn't liked it much. There's no love story and there aren't numerous extras around. Like I said: it stays in one story line. I liked it because it doesn't have all those special effects from movies nowadays were you can tell that's fake or that's computerized. Yes, the fights are kind of slow but is because nothing is over reacted, everything looks like it should, if it was a real situation which I think it was a good change. It could of have better scenes but I think is worth watching. Enjoy!!!!!!!!!"
tt6014472,"I actually enjoyed this movie - very happy with the quality and the premise - reasonably okay with the direction and dialogue. Granted it could have been even better - anything can be improved - but it was still an enjoyable film which managed to get us to care about some of the characters. Cinematography was good, fights scenes were good and happy enough to give it a 7/10. Sam Jaeger was great in the lead role and Adrianne Palicki is always a delight to watch - and even Michael Jai White did a surprisingly good job. Worth watching!"
tt6014472,"It's one of those films that ends up on t.v and you start watching and before the first commercial break you realise you've made a huge mistake with the remote. A cliche to say that you ""carried on watching hoping it would get better"" ... and it doesn't! Absolute pathetic drivel."
tt6014472,"""S.W.A.T.: Under Siege"" should delete its writer's credit and replace it with a line crediting everybody who has written an action film in the past. The plot draws heavily from ""Assault on Precinct 13"" and ""Safe House,"" with a lot of familiar tropes seen in dozens of genre films. What few mild surprises the plot offers generally happen off-screen, although it is not easy to predict which characters will die, who will kill whom and the order of their demises. The biggest surprise seems borrowed from ""Showdown in Little Tokyo"" and is surprising only because the film hadn't yet developed the characters – although, to their credit, it is a great improvement on the SILT scene. The bad guys who are really good and the good guys who are really bad could have simply worn T- shirts identifying themselves. The dialogue alternates between pretentious, execrable, familiar and unnecessary. Production values are generally adequate, although marred by over-reliance on distracting jiggly-cam shots. However, the fight scenes are capably executed. Michael Jai White is highly proficient and other cast members demonstrate considerable skill as well, including Marsden, Zagorsky, Jaeger and Palicki. The fight choreography is competent, although uninspired. The special effects incorporated into the numerous gun battles are handled well. Advocates of diversity in films should be encouraged by the ethnically diverse cast. However, skeptics will note that most of the Asian, Hispanic and black performers are in background roles and underutilized. The director seems to have attempted to give a couple of them more screen time with prolonged noble demises, but the shots seem more distracting than empowering. White delivers his dialogue with a heavy accent and another character is given an urban 'tude, but as in many films with large casts, the diversity seems more a result of casting decisions than screen writing choices."
tt6014472,"89 min. of my life that I won't get back. A poor script, fight scenes like slowmotion, I wish there was something good to say, because I like Michael Jai White, but there isn't."
tt6014472,"The correct title is:
S,W.A.T. - Ostromállapot
The hun title featured here is for the movie SWAT-Firefight"
tt6014472,"Should be a much better film with some of the actors they have, but this feels like they showed up to an abandon location and wrote and directed this movie in one day. It's not even a train wreck that you can't look away from, it is just plain horrible."
tt6014472,"This movie is exactly what a B-movie should be:Fast and fun.The plot is easy to follow,there no twist or turning point surprise me,non of the characters annoying or make stupid decisions.The kill count is high and see Michael Jai White kick plenty of ass is as awesome as ever cause this is one of his better movie in while some time.There not much flaws i can pinpoint out of this movie beside the extremely dumb bad guys and how not a single person in this movie have cell phone.Overall it a fun time and i definitely need check out other S.W.A.T movie"
tt6014472,The worst movie of its kind I've ever seen. the most amateur swat team in cinema
tt6014472,"I never got bored from the beginning to the end... good action, decent story and good acting.
All the actors did their job, someone better than someone else, but still... some problems with the martial arts, but nobody is perfect... Michael J White was the best, but it's not a surprise.
I love reading the reviews of many people unable to enjoy anything, full of anger, pissed of, full of poison, poor guys, you have a real bad life! BTW... you are the only to pay the consequences of your bad mood and attitude... don't think to affect anybody else than yourself... if you don't know that, it means you should learn something about awareness.
For those who like action movies and are not expecting always Oscar movies, and are able to appreciate the small things, give a try then.
I can't say that you won't be disappointed, but at least you decided whether or not this movie has been worthy of your time. Reading the opinion of other people and after that, deciding of not watching the movie, it doesn't make any sense... it's like to say: ""I don't like the avocado"" without trying that."
tt6014472,Not bad .It's just similar to bollywood movie khaki 2004 movie
tt6014472,"This is a remake of the John Carpenter classic. A prisoner is brought to a police facility. The officers quickly learn that the prisoner is wanted by very bad men. The good guys find themselves besieged, cut off from communication with the outside. In desperation they let the prisoner help them defend and... watch the Carpenter movie.Both movies are low budget affairs with cheap sets, poor camera work, and unconvincing action scenes. Despite the budget constraints, Carpenter's movie was engaging, thrilling, and memorable. This movie was silly, dull, and instantly forgettable. The budget of both films was probably the same. The difference is where the money was spent. Carpenter spent on story and creating tension. This film spent on a couple of recognizable actors. Carpenter did it right.Three stars for reminding me to rewatch Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13. No stars for this terrible film. Three stars."
tt7920024,"For me this movie just didn't work.
A whole bunch of narration and random scenes of this ice cold main character talking to her boyfriend or her friend.
Don't get me wrong, I love movies like this one that don't really make sense and get you into a trance like expierence, but this one was just not for me.
I have no idea what this movie was building up to and I have no idea what all of it meant. There was a lot going on and nothing was explained, wich worked in Mulholland Drive for example, but not here.
There was also a LOT of narration (a lot more than actual dialogue) and random shots of surroundings. Just a whole bunch of nothing...In my opinion this movie is just not as good as it maybe could have been."
tt7920024,"Anna meets Greg at a disco and after a whirlwind romance, long enough for him to grow a beard at least, he announces out of the blue his intention to move from their Paris home to Barcelona.Even during this first section of the film, the narrative thread is hard to grasp with many cuts between different times and places - a beach, a park and an abandoned theatre, for instance.But as the story approaches the doomed flight to Barcelona, things get really trance-like and surreal. Perhaps it all reflects Anna's increasingly tenuous grasp on a reality, which itself now seems to play out against a backdrop of constant and confused civil unrest.The camera is mostly hand-held and while some of the shots feel too close, others, especially those with actual riot police apparently completely surrounding the action of the movie are exceptional. The camera follows Anna, well played by Noémie Schmidt, pretty much all the way through.The final result, though, is just too disjointed and voice-overs used throughout the film aren't quite enough to keep things together. For some too, I guess that the frequent strobe effects (perhaps carried through from the disco at the start), might well feel a bit too much. 5/10"
tt7920024,"The reviews on here urged me to write my own. This is really not as bad as a movie as it is being described and rated as. If you enjoy your movies solely due to their storyline, this won't be one that you will enjoy. It's a movie with beautiful cinematography, outlining the struggles, worries and uncertainty that comes with early adulthood and first fiery loves."
tt7920024,"Sorry but... just no. If you'd like to see this movie, acted out live in front of you, read on. Go to your nearest college town. Find the hipster coffee shop that hosts open mic nights. Wait for the hipster girl that always gets up to read/act out her latest poem. There you go.. You've just watched a live version of this movie."
tt7920024,"The central theme or rather one of the main problems the characters face early on (that is a strain to any relationship), is something that fascinates me generally too. It's the psyche of people, what they think, how they act and what they would do for others, but to which effect and what cost? Some decisions are not easy to make at all.Yet while there are many interesting factors, the movie does not really get a hold or grip on many things. Quite the opposite is the case. The ending is quite obscure and throwing in a lot of things to make something stick might work for some viewers, but this will rather annoy many audience members. It's not super bad but it never really engages you in any way, which also makes it something that is far from good and a real shame"
tt7920024,No storyNot worth the time unless you need a Nap!Please why would someone waste their time and more importantly mine
tt7920024,I never rate or write a review for movie when I don't like it but watch this was the most annoying experience in my life!
tt7920024,"I really connected with the narration. Who am I? Who do I present myself to be? Are you putting on a face? Do you become that face? How do I want to live? What is worth it? And the gaps and connections in a love relationship. How deep did you feel that love connection, are you still feeling it? Does it still exist?I could have done without so much camera rotation effects."
tt7920024,"So boring, it was very annoying. The nonsense history of a girl who has nothing better to do than running everyday without any vision of future. I was looking forward to the movie end soon."
tt7920024,"This movie is not about a girl meeting a guy in paris. It is about Paris. About how Paris felt during these troubled times. If Paris was a person after the terrorist attack this is this person. Someone afraid, afraid of missing out, afraid of commitment, affraid of attachment, afraid of others... It expresses as a lonely, sad, lost but still charming and beautiful individual!
Paris est à nous is beautifully shot and expresses raw emotions. It is not an easy movie to watch and is very experimental but it is so worth it !"
tt7920024,"The script is strong. The ""pain"" of being human in a world that one cannot change the circumstances, being your ""self""in a relationship. You can find simple but strong moments about life. The character questions her self being feom childhood. A film about rethinking about the life. I also think that its also a strong film in visual ways and sound."
tt7920024,"It's a simple and ordinary movie. My expectation was higher, sorry."
tt7920024,"Maybe the storyline isn't so strong and it doen't have great developmant,but this movie is not about that. The aesthetics of the film was incredible. The movement of the camera, the scenes' sequence, the music and the voice-overs were brilliant. Also it touches some concept like the first love, who to deal with adulthood, etc with a very special way, that make you think about that.For me, if you like that in a film, it worth watching."
tt7920024,"Haven't seen a film like this since the early 90s - hand held camera, loose narrative style; all show, no tell. I like films that provoke the viewer to actively engage with the storytelling. Really interesting, though not for everyone. As a metaphor for trauma, coping with trauma and grief and the senselessness of life and death, it is provocative and thought-provoking."
tt7920024,"Even though the production of this movie is incredible, I have absolutely no clue of how to explain myself its story."
tt7920024,It's Joseph Campbell monomyth. Something about us having to die in order that something else flourish. The images are beautiful.
tt7920024,"The movie left me questioning if the later half of the storyline really happened or not. That is quite rare for me of a 21st century movie. This was no movie for a Marvel fan or a once-a-year-cinema type of person. This was a movie for the lover of cinematography and art. Becuase it really doesn't have an exciting storyline. It is all about how it makes you feel. It not only tells a love story, but let's us get in the minds of both protagonists; getting us to attach to them even more.
Conclusion: If you don't like movies like Amelie, Totoro, Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind; you probably wouldn't like this one either. It is a movie that's not afraid of being controversial and I believe that's what makes it a ""hidden gem"". I only recommend these types of movies to friends that have good taste in art-movies and has the cinema culture necessary to compare it to similar titles."
tt7920024,"Anna misses the flight she should have taken to find Greg in Barcelona. The plane crashes. Taken in the giddiness of a death that has been barely avoided, she moves away from truth and the present. As this couple breaks up, Paris becomes the echo of distress.
It's a collage and some sequences are stronger than other. Some dialogues are good, or so they seem in the beginning, later in the movie the lines become clichéd and unbearably boring. The sequence in the theatre is probably the weakest. This movie expresses some concepts (loneliness, self- doubt, fear, but not sure how much of this romance movie really entailed love). A lot of narration and random scenes of this ice cold protagonist (at times excessively jolly with a lack of realistic middle ground) talking to her boyfriend or her ex/ late boyfriend, which didn't make sense and missed the trance like effect, usually expected out of such movies. It'd work out as a short film but not as a complete length movie. For this to be a movie, a lot more work had to be put in."
tt7920024,"There is no plot in this movie and this is not what is all about.
It's only about a confused generation that takes everything for granted, that has the impression they don't need to think, they don't need to do anything but letting others imagine what they need and if the others don't imagine, they become upset that the world does not understand them. It's about people letting emotions take place over anything else: logic, society, connecting to other people.
It is what people will become in tens of years from now."
tt7920024,"It's the moment in a love relationship that contains all the rest. It's a bud of pure potential now blossoming into story.And ultimately, the story that unfolds will be a tragedy--as all love stories are.Anna meets Greg, Anna loses Greg. Anna grieves and makes her peace. All in a film of visual power and knowing symbolism.At this point it's tempting to say 'enjoy.' But this is not the cinematic neighbourhood where the word applies, quite. I have no idea whether or not you will 'enjoy' this film. It's unlikely that its creator cares. You can count, though, on being moved."
tt7920024,"I was looking for a movie about Paris, and by sheer luck Netflix gave me this. It was more than I had asked for and now it's one of my favorites. It's the kind of film that you can watch many times over and you leave with something new each time.The poster, and the first few scenes lead you to think it's a love story. It is not. Soon enough it descends into deep existentialism and an exploration of the subconscious.I love the camera work in this, the persepective is intimate as if I was watching a Terrence Malick film though it also has the surrealism of a Lynch film or Eternal Sunshine.The script is superbly written, the dialogues are raw and the monologues poetic.I don't understand why this film has such a low rating here or why I never heard about if before. Perhaps some disappointed viewers who wanted a romantic drama."
tt7920024,"Yes it is confusing and yes the storyline is kind of abstract but that's the magic of it! Beautyfully written and directed this movie makes you forget your reality and get lost in Paris where questions haunt you. Could be better but if you like movies that are like poetry/literature, it's worth watching!"
tt7920024,"I don't feel like writing a long drawn out review for this, but would just like to say that I'm positive all those people who gave it a bad review probably didn't watch it in its original language, French nor would they even understand French. The movie is one of the best I've seen. It's intense to say the least, and the story and dialogue are fantastic. It makes you question everything in life. I'm highly doubtful that the English dubbed version would translate as well or even have the same impact on me as the French version has. I could literally watch this movie again."
tt7920024,"I loved it! It's not a masterpiece, but there is probably great thing to come from this director.
It's a collage and some sequences are stronger than other. The sequence in the theatre is probably the weakest. Some sequence would
The camera work and sound/music are incredible, I could see lots of refreshing idea, interesting character that are not often portrayed in movies.
This movie express some concepts (loneliness, incompletion, fears but also love) in a really unique way.
It makes me think of Depardon, Tarkowski and Truffaut. We can see some love for the pictures. Some times are more meaningful than others. but I like to watch cool efftets and picture for the sake of it. Sure it's closer from a music video than a traditional blockbusters. but don't we have already enough of them.
Watch it with an open mind, enjoy what is being shared without expecting a traditionnal storyline and construction."
tt7511008,"I love films set in Thailand, so when Netflix offered this flick, I jumped at the chance to watch it. And since it was also a French production, I was hoping for something better than B-movie trash produced in the U.S. I was pretty disappointed.The plot is that Mehdi, a member of a gang that robbed a bank 15 years earlier in France who was the only one caught by cops, is released from prison and joins the rest of the gang on the Thai tourist island of Phuket. The Phuket-based members are all doing well in the businesses they set up with the 2.4 million euros they stole. The trouble starts when Mehdi, citing how he spent 15 years in prison while the rest of the gang was in paradise enjoying their loot, wants his share of the money, or 400,000 euros, so that he can go back to France. The members make various excuses on why they cannot pay him now but the member closest to Hicham, now married to a Thai woman whose brother is a police chief on Phuket, pledges to get Mehdi his money. Things go south for the gang from there as Mehdi erroneously thinks the methods he employed in France will work in Thailand.The sets were great and reminded me of Thailand, and also got me wanting to go back. The problem is, the plot has a few unbelievable elements and twists that just don't make sense. As much as I enjoyed the film mainly because it was set in Thailand, well, I can't say it's a good movie. It didn't suck as the plot did have twists and turns that had me guessing but in the end, the ending fell flat. That said, I still enjoyed it and for those who love Thailand, this film is fun."
tt7511008,Give it a watch. It's not as terrible as people are making it seem.
tt7511008,"It's not great but it's also not terrible or boring. Some scenes are unnecessary but in general it's a watchable movie.P.S. The review complaining about ""unfaithful wife"", didn't understand the movie apparently."
tt7511008,"Sami Bouajila (Sauver ou périr, Indigènes, ...) and Hubert Koundé (La haine) are trapped in a disappointing movie in which the 9-3 invades Thailand with a superficial script and an avalanche of clichés (communitarianism, violence, ...)"
tt7511008,Worst plot Ive ever seen. Looks like a high 16 year old made it.
tt7511008,"Some of the worst acting I have never seen. Even the plot is lame. Just when you think this movie has some potential, they throw some complete nonsense into the mix with complete garbage acting performances. Don't waste your time."
tt7511008,"I give the 2 stars to the beautiful scenery, as a fan of Thailand and Patong Beach that was the best part. The rest of it a total mess, with weird musical montages and a bunch of pathetic thugs, rubbish."
tt7511008,"I got thrilled with some scenes, the violence is well choreographed and some acting is just great.
Just enjoy it"
tt7511008,But the storyline was atrocious. Absolutely no thought went into the script.
tt7511008,"An interesting story set against a stunning backdrop. Don't listen to the negative reviews. This is a short and sweet crime thriller with a few plot twists, that will kill an hour and a half with ease. It's worth the journey, enjoy!"
tt7511008,"I watched this bc I live in Patong. Stereotypes and a lot of fake ideas of this place. I know many people in movie and place too. Good photography and scenery, real life in bag round, but free easy violence in club is only fake. The story is very poor of fantasy and originality.
French production ? C series or less."
tt7511008,"It was a nice story. All the characters motivs are well done. Not thee great movie, but I enjoyed it."
tt7511008,"Not everything has to be sunshine and happiness. Not everything has to have a hero that is a white knight (no pun intended). There can be movies about criminals and their questionable task/search for ""justice"". Having said that, the movie really will take a lot from the viewer.You may get invested in a character or two, but that does not mean that character will behave the way you want them too. This is a weird little experiment, a movie that will go sideways, when you expect it to just go straight ahead. You can cherish that or hate it for that ... but it sure makes for one intriguing viewing"
tt7511008,"Everything else, story, acting, music, directing is strictly C list. I'll watch another Thai movie in 20 years to see if they have been improving. Note to Netflix - don't greenlight any Thai movies unless there are enough people in the country to enable it to turn a profit."
tt7511008,"This movies seemed to be a sort of pet project made between friends, who happened to be in Thailand with a faulty gimbal. The script makes no sense. The acting is mediocre. The ""action"" is bad... And is nowhere as thrilling as the trailer made you believe it to be.
Starts awful and never picks up."
tt7511008,"Poor acting, poor dialog, stupid plot, bad ideas and really poorly done language sub-captioning."
tt7511008,I'll tell you why... Because it's stupid. Good movies and television shows don't exist on this planet anymore.
tt7511008,Great place with boring movie! Don't wast your time
tt7511008,Sweet jes*s why this Plot? I could overlook the acting Bit this storyline makes no sense and only leaves me with questions... Can i please have my 90 minutes back? Complete waste of time..
tt7511008,"I've watched Paradise beach without looking at the ratings.Good storyline, great locations.Cast is good.I enjoyed this movie.Maybe the ratings are low possibly because of the hype?"
tt7511008,Some films have some bad acting but to get a film with absolutely no half decent performances is a one in a million.
tt7511008,"Let's be clear; that's not a great movie, not a masterpiece, but I love this film. Remember J'IRAI AU PARADIS CAR L'ENFER EST ICI?, twenty one years ago, also directed by Durringer and also written by ex con Jean Miez? Here you have another hoodlum tale taking place in Thailand, a place which Durringer has some connections with; check one or two of his past features. In this movie, you have a table conversation scene made with a long shot, as you also had in J'IRAI AU PARADIS, with excellent dialogues and character scenery...As Durringer probably took from Tarantino's RESERVOIR and also a heist that we never saw. That said, back to this movie, that's not a so good film as directing and sometimes acting, but that's a bloody, dark, bleak and brutal gangster film, in the pure film noir tradition. I highly recommend it for crime films lovers."
tt7511008,"Okay, why the bad reviews? I thought this was a great action/thriller. A Great twist."
tt7511008,I'm too bored and tired to cut it off. I never have any ideas ninety some minutes could be so long.
tt9652322,This movie had too many high rated actors. None of them stood out. Everything just felt rushed and forced
tt9652322,"Leading by example and all that. I do understand if some viewers are way more annoyed than others. It really is in the eye of the beholder and while the movie tries to tell a morality tale (sort of), it really misses to connect most of the time with the people watching (supposed to be entertained and you know learn something for life, I reckon?).It's not the worst movie I've seen by a longshot. But it is sure to leave most unengaged (the ending did not make it any better either). Liked the music in the end credits, but even that might split some people"
tt9652322,I really couldn't wait to watch this movie only to get disappointed! The whole thing felt forced and rushed. Porous acting with shallow characters. I was cringing throughout because it was simply not funny.
tt9652322,"There was a time Nigerian movies did engage you. Now its getting worse. Its like someone just comes up with a different story and tries to force it on everyone by using top actors. At the end, the movie fails in every way.
The director needs a reorientation."
tt9652322,This movie is soo bad that 5 minutes to the end you're still wondering what's going o. Same old Ebonylife narrative of using a big party scene and star cast to sell am movie
tt9652322,"Great movie, great acting. would be nice to see a part 2 of it."
tt9652322,No lesson learnt. Too many star actors. Highly disappointed in all of them. The big actors all of a sudden sound foolish in one movie. Those that are not comedians decided to try out with this movie. Unserious roles. Please we don't want part2. Its enough here
tt9652322,"To be honest, Chief Daddy was really disappointing. Star studded but yet not much you can lay hold of. I think the directing should bear most of the fault from this train wreck alongside the incoherent writing. The cinematography also, as there were moments when an unneccessary camera shake dented the believability of the scene even more than the forced humour.
On the good side, Falz did quite well with the role he was given. The end credits song was quite hilarious. To the producers, please this should mark the end of this destinationless franchise."
tt9652322,"Chief Beecroft is an industrial billionaire who dies in his dining room at his table. Days after, his lawyer shows up with an invitation to his family to read his codicil before his will. The family includes his daughters from his first wife, his second wife and their son.....and his three mistresses WITH there children, along with a son NO ONE knew about. The codicil reads that EVERYONE should stay in the family home and prepare his funeral. If they get to fighting and leave, NOTHING will be left to anyone. This film was funny, and it would probably been funnier to me if the accents weren't so thick while talking so fast. I kept trying to decipher so many times and just let it go and let the film move on. Still, it was a pleasant flick and I totally enjoyed it."
tt9652322,Pointless movie with mostly terrible acting and very shallow characters. It doesn't help either that it was basically full of tribalist jabs at Igbo from Yoruba people.
tt9652322,"I was really surprised to read negative reviews for this movie. Do we truly know what a good movie is? This movie was really good, very enjoyable. Well developed characters, believable and relatable story line. And the quality, fantastic. Well done guys. Loved it even more than wedding party 1 and 2. I am not disappointed at all."
tt9652322,"The movie was awesome with beautiful characters. I love seeing Bisola in movies, she's good."
tt9652322,"Chief Daddy is the type of movie you can watch over and over. The actors are fantastic, and the movie overall is a not-so-serious narration with valuable teachable moments. Sure there are a few plot holes that could have been handled better, but overall I would recommend."
tt4008566,"The nurse Alicia (Manuela Vellés) is summoned by her sister Sara (Maggie Civantos) and returns to the dark house of her mother Victoria (Emma Suárez) with her husband, the unemployed electrician Mikel (Alain Hernández), and their ten year-old daughter Nora (Claudia Placer). Alicia and Victoria have been estranged to each other for many years and now Victoria is terminal in comatose and Alicia will help the nurse Ana (Marta Castellote). Alicia has recollections from her abused childhood, when Sara and she were maltreated and controlled by her mother in rituals of witchcraft. Mikel finds a room with witchcraft objects and occult books that belong to Victoria, shows to his wife and they keep it locked. Soon Nora communicates with Victoria and changes her behavior, befriend the creepy outcast girl Luna (Daniela Rubio) and Alicia realizes that her daughter in under control of the witch Victoria.""La influencia"", a.k.a. ""The Influence"", is a creepy horror film developed in slow pace like most of the European movies. The atmosphere is dark and gruesome, the performances are great but the story becomes predictable when the lawyer reads the testament. The screenplay could be better but the underrated ""La influencia"" is a good horror film. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Not Available"
tt4008566,"There is some good here, the different cultural ideas of the horrific makes the film feel more original than a lot of mediocre modern possession horror. There are some real points here about parental abuse and how it can be covered up and passed on.At the same time however it is all over the place. The narrative structure swerves all over the place and the message, tone and overall horror is kind of lost in a confusing haze.Overall this movie is definitely not trash, and there is some good to be found, it's just a bit messy, so if you are used to well thought out and clear cut narrative then you'd probably want to avoid this one."
tt4008566,"I read a lot of really bad reviews for La Influencia but to be honest I think most of them are a bit too harsh. I agree that it's not a masterpiece, certainly not in the horror genre, but for a Spanish horror movie it has its moments. A couple jump scares, a story that is suspenseful enough to be entertaining, and a cast that might never win an Oscar but that is better than average. All in all La Influencia isn't that bad, just don't have too high of expectations."
tt4008566,"I didn't find this to be a slow burn as some have sugggested, but I found it to be very disjointed and didn't pace well. Too many things are happening that you don't know what the story is, until toward the latter half, and even then it was still all over the place. It is like a ghost movie, no wait its a possession movie, no wait its a witch movie, no its a revenge movie.....sigh. It is like it didn't know where to go with all of the activity...oh yeah there is poltergeist activity too. Good grief this was difficult to watch and try to stay focused."
tt4008566,"I've tried to look for some positives in this film, and not to simply just say it's a poor film, but in reality it's just a poor film. It's tagged as a horror, it isn't, or if it is, then those behind it have very different views on what makes a good horror movie. It is agonisingly slow, the pacing is the main issue, you keep wanting something to happen, for it to spark into life, but that moment never comes. The story was all over the place, it made no sense.If you can reach the end, you're a trooper. I was just bored. 3/10"
tt4008566,"There should be a penalty for the release of this kind of movie. Really. No joke! Bad acting, bad storyline, bad lighting... My boyfriend gave up after 50 minutes. I finished watching it some days later because... you know... I probably have mental illness."
tt4008566,"This movie is not bad by any means, i dont get the low ratings at all. I almost skipped it because of said ratings but am glad i didnt. Maybe its because people watches a dubbed version but this is 2019 no reason to do that. maybe its because im into witchcraft and the occult so it appealed to me more than the average viewer. Either way they really captured the dark feeling of mexican witchcraft (which in my opinion) is much darker and ""scarier"" then todays americanized version which is more akin to cheesy hollywood pointy hats and love spells then real witchcraft but i digress the influence is basically a south american version of heriditary (also a great movie) and usually after seeing 2 movies so similar in content as close together i cant help but to dislike the later simply because i saw the other first but thats not the case with these two. i liked both movies quite well and have no doubt ill revisit this one again. ignore the negative ratings, i imagine most of those are coming from kids of the instant gratification generation anyways all in all this was a very decent movie"
tt4008566,Imagine a bad cook trying to make hearty soup. Get everything in your kitchen and chuck it into a pot and imagine it will turn out ok. What you get is every cliche of every horror film you've ever seen thrown together with a weak narrative. Sadly boring and un-engaging.
tt4008566,"Why are there so much very bad reviews?It is not the best bovie I have ever seen by far, but he is still OK, I liked it!A 7,0 of 10 for me."
tt4008566,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. But wow, this was a snoozefest of untold proportions. I got 35 minutes into the movie and I was ready to give up, but I decided to give the movie a second chance, because it might actually pick up its pace and become interesting.So I continued watching, but the movie just kept on trotting in the same monotonous slow pace with very little happening. I managed to get 55 minutes into the ordeal known as ""La Influencia"" (aka ""The Influence"") and then I just had enough. This movie is phenomenally boring and slow paced. Even a turtle sitting down to watch this 2019 movie from director Denis Rovira van Boekholt would go 'Seriously? This is even too slow for the likes of me!'It should be said that the atmosphere in the old house is quite good, and the movie is filmed in a nice enough manner. But it doesn't do much to make up for all other shortcomings that ""La Influencia"" had. Man, this movie was a bore.I have zero interest in returning to watch the rest of the movie, because I simply didn't care one bit about the storyline, and the characters in the movie were so mundane and pointless that they were just a hazy blur actually. And I don't even bother to find out what was actually going on in the movie, because I simply just doesn't care about the storyline.""La Influencia"" scores a mere two out of ten stars from me. The only reason why it doesn't score one star is because of the atmosphere that permeated the 55 minutes of the movie that I suffered through, and the production value that the movie had."
tt4008566,"If you like foreign movies, then you know it's not moving a mile a minute like American movies. I am quite a horror buff, So I don't get scared very often. So... I Like creepy, not just slasher films. This was eerie, I was sitting on the edge of my seat. So I do recommend this movie to people that do like foreign movies."

What is the source of evil? Is it the mother ? Her things? The house ? The sisters? There is too much going on here. So dumb."
tt4008566,Its not a thriller nor a scary movie. Total waste.
tt4008566,"I can't find a film that entertains and scares me. I didn't expect much from this one.
It wasn't scary but it kept me entertained. It was better than a lot of American over CGI'd and overacted movies but with the usual flIckering lights and jump scare tacticsOverall better than some famous so called horror films."
tt4008566,"The movie tries to tell an interesting story in a style that reminds us of Petsemetary. But even though it's not the usual stuff we see the plot is still prrfictable.
Camera and actors are pretty good. Unfortunately the movie is too long. Often scenes are unnecessary for the story e.g. the family meeting or simply too long. Even when you think the finale is coming the story continues with another boring and partly unnecessary 15 minutes.
Maybe the story had more power if it was a compressed to a 45 or 60 minute episode of a modern 'Tales rom the Crypt'"
tt4008566,"The Influence (La Infuencia): Spanish horror film. Alicia (Manuela Velles) moves back home to help her sister Sara (Maggie Civantos) care for their coma stricken mother Victoria (Emma Suarez). Through flashbacks we see how Victoria, a Witch, maltreated both girls, forcing them to partake in her rituals, using a mirror and lockets containing hair and nails to control them. The house is dark and some rooms are filled with the mothers occult objects and books in particular an ibex skull which figures throughout the the film. There are also spiders, lots of spiders.Alicia's daughter Nora (Claudia Placer) seems to able to communicate with the comatose Victoria but soon starts to fall under control of the Witches spirit, reacting violently to verbal bullying at school. She becomes trapped in her grandmother's room, poltergeist activity takes place. Nora also meets an oddly attired young girl, Luna (Daniela Rubio), who vandalises cars and walks on hot ashes.The Influence is based on a story by Ramsey Campbell but is in some ways reminiscent of Hereditary particularly in plot development but is more unevenly paced and is pretty much a slow burner. Some truly terrifying scenes and the house itself provides a dark Gothic setting. Really good performances from Placer and Rubio, also by Sofia Tolina and Berta Sanchez as the young Alicia and Sara. This is Director Denis Rovira van Boekholt's first feature film and caveats aside is entertaining and scarifying. 7/10. On Netflix."
tt4008566,Sorry for the actors but I wasted my time watching this movie. It was hard to watch it and not good line to follow up. Not recommended.
tt4008566,"No I'm not under ""the influence"" - although if I was, I would deny it, wouldn't I? Probably ... so bad joke aside and back the movie. I am surprised about the low rating, but it just goes to show you that tastes are different! Way different. And I'm not saying anything about anyone being right or wrong (although to keep a theme going that should be write or rong I reckon, as in ""waist of time"" - which in turn would make a great movie title) ... this is just about what someone likes to watch and what not.This is more of slow burner, though it still has quite a lot of jump scares. And even the sturcture and build up is quite interesting. You kind of know that something wicked has happened and you know something evil is lurking ... and still it is comprehensive and it is tension filled enough to work. If you go with the flow that is ... can you dig it? I for once like my horror to challenge me a little bit, not to mention the characters involved!"
tt4008566,"I can't wait to see more from this director. Very small amount of characters, a small space, and he builds the tension slowly, until you are so stress to see how It ends, that you can not stand it anymore.The story itself its not something we havent seen before, but Its definetely worth It to see how it develops itself. All the cast are great.Must seen for horror funs or for people aiming to get scared."
tt4008566,The next level from pathetic.It takes only ten minutes to discover how pathetic the film is. And another thirty to discover that it is possible to make an unbearable film. I had to leave the cinema.
tt4008566,"An interesting movie as the script is different,and the actors and the child artists are also good..there is a good suspense mood"
tt10121392,"Stupid movie. Yup. Predictable and nothing new here. This movie has been made about 30 times but hey.. there's a few chuckles and it kills some time.If you go into this thinking your gonna be surprised or impressed. You're gonna hate it. I say, lighten up and have some fun. Because that's all this silly film is. Fun and empty calories."
tt10121392,"This was like a blah Disney movie but with curse words and sexual innuendos so I'm confused as to who the target audience is. Melissa McCarthy's (whom I love) husband wrote and directed the movie and once again he just doesn't have what it takes. All of his films have been stinkers. I also love Octavia Spencer but she isn't a comedic actress so her performance fell very flat for me. Overall, I'd say skip it. It was boring and brought nothing at all original to the table."
tt10121392,"By any yardstick that you choose to compare ""Thunder Force"" too... it's pretty terrible. That said, I just couldn't generate any genuine hatred for it. It's essentially just a group of friends and family messing about.In a world where enhanced supervillains exist, two school friends drift apart. Decades later, Emily (Octavia Spencer) is a successful scientist working on a way to give powers to the right people, and fight back. Lydia (Melissa McCarthy) has been less successful, but wishes her friendship with Emily had been maintained. On the night of a school reunion, Lydia goes to see Emily at her lab and is accidentally injected with a serum that gives her superhuman strength and resilience. Emily had always planned to be a hero too, so takes the serum also and becomes invisible at will. The pair form a team, THUNDER FORCE, and start to fight back against the villainous forces.I mean, it's rubbish. It's full of performers who can do a lot better, who seemingly agreed to do this so they could hang around with their friends, which is fine. It's not funny or I should say, it's hardly ever funny - occasionally there's some business with Jason Bateman that made me chuckle. His crab based supporting villain turned love interest is, at least, knowing.There's a persuasive awkwardness to the whole endeavour though, never quite sure how deep into parody it's going - but again, I couldn't really come to actively hate it. It doesn't really care that deeply, and neither did I. Never again though."
tt10121392,"Again, Netflix what's up with you? What is this silly, sleepy superhero movie that you produced? Wouldn't it be better spending money in something meaningful or at least entertaining? Luckily the cast is not all bad and Jason Bateman steals the show playing the crab...! His parts are very funny. So I m not entirely upset that I have spent time watching this. But looking back to it, yes I can conclude to the fact that it's one of the most unnecessary films I have ever watched. 2,7/10 just for these small moments, which were funny."
tt10121392,"While Melissa McCarthy can be funny (I enjoyed The Heat and Spy), it's obvious no matter the studio, everything McCarthy and her husband, Ben Falcone, offer up is immediately greenlit. That has to stop. This is the umpeeth unfunny movie by the married duo.After the first 30 minutes, I simply had the movie on in the background, but could still hear McCarthy's ad-libs which were excruciatingly awful.If this is the best an immensely talented actress like Octavia Spencer has to pick from, that's a sad commentary on the state of comedic films. Let's hope she got a big, upfront payday."
tt10121392,"I watched this thinking Melissa, Octavia and Jason wouldn't betray me with some crappy, predictable comedy. I was wrong. I mean, it's not unwatchable but it's definitely not worth a rewatch. Just put it on to play when you go out so the dogs have some background noise to distract them from chewing your furniture."
tt10121392,"Actually a good movie if you don't take it too seriously. Extremely surprised that this was rated a 4! Sure, it's cheesy, but heartfelt and fun. Reminds of the ""The Mask"" with Jim Carrey, "" My Super Ex-Girlfriend"" with Uma Thurman, or Will Smith's ""Hancock"". Not going to win any awards but definitely deserved far more credit than it's been given!"
tt10121392,"This film has almost no redeeming qualities. In particular the ""humour"" is forced, juvenile, and universally falls flat. Epic fail."
tt10121392,"Last movie I saw was Minari, it was great, but sometimes watching something silly that doesn't invoke a lot of emotion is good for the soul too. After a long week of work and being tired and needing to unwind I watched this and found it really entertaining. Laughed out loud throughout the whole movie. If you like Melissa McCarthy then you'll enjoy this. Especially with her teamed up with Jason Bateman again. If you are looking for something to stimulate you intellectually this isn't the movie but it isn't intended to be either."
tt10121392,"3 words that best describe this movie are: bland, predictable and unnecessary. I really don't get it. To build this kind of film it costs millions of dollars and how no one saw that this isn't hit just a flop. They had great cast, acting was really on point but plot is just terrible. Nothing unique in this movie, no jokes, comedy is in such a low level. Imdb have put this film in most waited spring movies and I believed in that. Now I'm just disappointed and angry. I wouldn't recommend to watch this film because it doesn't worth your time."
tt10121392,"Ok... this is not a movie I would want to see in the cinema, but it is a light and silly comedy with enjoyable characters and not much to digest mentally or emotionally. It's one of those movies you watch on a plane or when you want something light and goofy. Don't try to read too much into it or you will be disappointed. Take it for what it is and have fun."
tt10121392,"It's not as bad as the majority is claiming, it definitely has it moments. It could be better, it made me laugh a few times but it's not a gut buster. It's not your typical superhero movie, so I don't know why anyone would think it is. I chose to watch it because I knew that it would make me laugh."
tt10121392,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Ben Falcone and Melissa McCarthy, husband and wife, have been making movies together since the former began his filmmaking career. Literally, every film directed, written, and/or produced by Falcone has the famous actress in the lead role, all exploring subgenres of comedy. From romance (Superintelligence) to crime (The Happytime Murders), without forgetting a road trip (Tammy), now comes the time for Thunder Force, a dive into the highly profitable superhero circle. However, I don't believe the couple's real goal is to deliver a globally liked movie. Actually, I firmly defend that their purpose is to provide the most nonsensical piece of storytelling possible, hoping that viewers find it entertaining enough.Directors, screenwriters, actors, and every other crew member... a vast majority aspire to deliver a groundbreaking masterpiece. A film recognized by everyone as ""remarkable cinema"". Something worthy of many Oscars, Golden Globes, and much more. Movies like Thunder Force aren't made to receive regular nominations, but instead, to try and be present at the Razzies - both Falcone and McCarthy have been quite successful in this achievement. While the actress continuously shows her undeniable talent that would be better employed in other films - such as Can You Ever Forgive Me? And Bridesmaids - the writer-director continues to put together awfully dull movies.To be completely honest, the first act of Thunder Force is surprisingly decent. The setup to the main narrative is interesting enough, and the comedy peak is reached during the first half-hour. The massive problem is that this peak offers no more than a couple of chuckles occasionally. From the start of the second act until the very end, Falcone embarrassingly fails to offer genuine laughs. The tone is ridiculously out-of-balance, with almost every scene being a forced attempt at humor, even when the moment doesn't ask for it. Incredibly flat - and some disgusting - jokes are repeated throughout the film, which ends up dragging an already stretched out runtime.The superhero plot is as generic and predictable as it could be in a movie that makes no effort in trying to do something remotely different than what viewers have seen for the last couple of decades. The VFX look like they came from an amateur studio as if Netflix didn't even care about its own product. Story-wise, there's not even a proper way of analyzing such a silly screenplay. In one moment, it seems to be taking a specific scene seriously, but a couple of minutes later, everything is back to the annoyingly dumb environment. Don't get me wrong: if there's a type of humor I absolutely adore is absurd comedy, but it needs to be done properly, with the right people and the right story.In the end, I usually tend to have a light hand in films like this. Thunder Force is just another addition to the never-ending list of ""forgettable movies"", which isn't something that really bothers me. It's exactly what everyone expects it to be, which can work as a compliment if people want to. The most frustrating aspect of all of this is watching McCarthy and Octavia Spencer - two outstanding actresses with five Oscar nominations combined, including a win for the latter in The Help - working on hopeless projects such as this one. It begs the famous question: why?Thunder Force is yet another piece of pointless, absurd storytelling from Ben Falcone, featuring unbearably dry, forced humor, besides a forgettable story. A film that cross-checks every requirement for a Razzies contender, something quite familiar for the writer-director and his wife, Melissa McCarthy, who keeps doing favors. Despite an admittedly decent first act, the rest of the film goes downhill concerning its entertainment value. Honestly, I don't know what's worse: witnessing McCarthy and Octavia Spencer waste her exceptional talent in nonsensical movies or seeing major studios continue to give opportunities to filmmakers that have nothing important to say while necessary, significant voices are still out there waiting desperately for their shot. The best compliment I can give this Netflix product is that it doesn't mislead anyone: it's precisely what viewers expect it to be, whether that's nice or horrible.Rating: D."
tt10121392,"Probably the worst Melissa McCarthy movie so far. Really bad, boring and looks cheap. McCarthy is OK in this but Octavia Spencer is dreadful."
tt10121392,"If you really, really want to see this movie, just watch the trailer. It's all there. I've made it to an half an hour mark and couldn't watch anymore. Not a single laugh!!! No humor, stupid plot, no humor, draging, no freaking humor! Trailer is just missleading, you are not getting all that fun and humor throughout this movie..."
tt10121392,"Boring, I couldn't continue watching it.Dont wast ur time."
tt10121392,"""I'll do everything in my power to keep you safe. I'm doing this for my parents, for my city.""Believe it or not, Ben Falcone may have made his worst movie yet. In a world where supervillains are commonplace, two estranged childhood best friends reunite after one devises a treatment that gives them powers to protect their city. Thunder Force has Octavia Spencer and (who would've thought) Melissa McCarthy leading this comedic take on superheroes. We all know that his movies aren't meant to be taken too seriously with how silly they are. Nothing about this movie is funny. I didn't laugh once even with the comedic genius that is McCarthy. The movie is so boring. We thought Superintelligence was awful but this is even more intolerable. First off, it's so prolonged to the point where it runs out of ideas. It's so predictable that it gets annoying. I will reiterate that this is not funny at all. There are so many forced moments to make a joke but they're too forced to even get a smirk out. I feel so bad for Octavia Spencer because she is genuinely a great actress and has a fairly good track record. Melissa McCarthy has fallen off the radar shortly after her Oscar nominated performance for Can You Ever Forgive Me? And it's not surprising. She's also finding horrible projects to be attached to, mainly being her husband (Ben Falcone), and gets an even worse reputation. Maybe someday she'll find a glimmer of hope again. I don't like ripping on movies so I'll end it here. A select few might like this. As for me I'll forget about it until I'm reminded of it again at the end of the year."
tt10121392,People are being ridiculous...it's a cute movie man very watchable and family friendly...what did these low raters want? Who cares? Anywho only critique...the camp or the action needed to be punched up just a hair...also the crabs backstory would have been awesome.
tt10121392,"I had high hopes for thunder force, but the reviews don't lie... it's unfunny and lacks chemistry. I only laughed a handful of times and even those were half hearted. The script was bland and the storyline predictable. I couldn't tell if it was serious or a spoof and either way it didn't work."
tt10121392,"I just watched this and was shocked to see the bad reviews. In my opinion this movie was great! Melissa McCarthy is amazing as always and Octavia Spencer, although plays a rather downplayed character, is just as amazing. As a lover of marvel and DC films it was so interesting to see older, plus sized superhero's as well as more POC representation! I loved the story and the characters (apart from crab arms wtf 😂), the comedic timing was brilliant and I would love to see a sequel! I definitely recommend giving this movie a chance and judging it for yourself instead of going off of the negative reviews!"
tt10121392,"Okay, I admit it might not be very very good but I had a lot of fun watching. Spencer and McCharty are two of my favorite actresses, and they have been such a fun crew. Although almost all of Melissa's movies are nonsense, she manages to make me laugh every time and I love her genuine sincerity. It was a geek movie full of easter eggs. Titans, West Side Story, Slayers...I really enjoyed watching. I guess it would be a good choice for a chill out and a fun weekend."
tt10121392,This could have been a good funny film but it was let down buy a terrible script and strange editing. The other issue is that many of the cultural references are so US focused that anyone outside that country would fail to get the humour...ergo a failure.
tt10121392,"I really wanted to like this after seeing the two stars beings interviewed.Its starts off well.It has an interesting premise.Most of the jokes fall flat - McCarthy is just not funny, mostly, in this.What starts out as reasonably original soon transcends into ""seen something very similar to this before, I know whats going to happen next"" territory, which would be fine if most of the jokes landed. They don't.Special effects are pretty good.Around the halfway point I realised it wasn't going to go anywhere and I started to get bored.For me, the big saving grace and the reason for my 5 star rating is Jason Bateman. He is fantastic in this and funny - love scenes with McCarthy aside (I didn't get the ""jokes"").If I had paid anything to see this I would have felt short changed."
tt10121392,1 out of 5 stars.Thunder Force is a bad comedy superhero film that fails to deliver laughs. Boring cast ensemble. And the plot is another waste of time. Melissa McCarthy and Husband Ben Falcone who also directed and wrote the film have been on another track record of making atrocious comedy films. Which the humor has been the same in all there films. Boring cheesy dialogue. Terrible humor that delivers more eye rolls than laughs. Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer were unfunny. Jason Bateman playing a Crab handed character also seemed bored with the role.The plot following people having superhero powers. A corrupt mayor who has his hidden agenda. While Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer team up with super strength to stop the bad guys.Terrible cgi. Cheesy dialogue. Boring action. And the humor is terrible. It is one comedy film that is best to miss.
tt11010144,First time watching South African movie! And the fashion was on point. So colourful! And I love being able to see and hear and just get to know South Africa.
tt11010144,"Excusing the ignorant yet typical American, who thinks a clean English accent is some kind of american representation...this FULLY South African Cast and Production is another great attempt at a romcom. This is a relatively new genre for the South African film industry, and though there were a few cringe-worthy acting moments, the movie was refreshing, playful, and what is to be expected of your regular romcom.There is space for improvement in regards to originality in script, though this is a problem we see in general across, all national film industries, so let's not pretend this is where this all started. Overplayed scenarios and cliches have become the bread and butter of Hollywood, though hopefully not so much Netflix. Looking forward to the more creative side of Lwazi Mvusi. Great attempt."
tt11010144,"First of all, a movie such as this usually falls somewhat outside of my preference of movies to watch. But I had the opportunity to sit down and watch it, and given the fact that I hadn't already seen it, I thought I might give the movie a chance, even without ever having heard of the movie prior to now.Well, ""Seriously Single"" from writer Lwazi Mvusi happened to be a very straightforward, although very generic, romantic comedy, for better or worse. Of course there is a an audience out there for a sappy movie such as this. But yeah, it falls into the category of once-you've-seen-one-movie-like-this-you've-essentially-seen-them all. Yup, it was that much of a step-by-step manuscript of how-to-make-a-romcom.The acting in the movie was adequate, taking into consideration the type of movie that it was, and the limitations of the script and storyline. I wasn't familiar with a single actress or actor in the movie, which was something that actually worked out well for me.""Seriously Single"" was adequately entertaining, although it was by no account an outstanding movie.My rating of directors Katleho Ramaphakela and Rethabile Ramaphakela's movie is a bland and mediocre five out of ten stars."
tt11010144,"It's so sad to watch a movie about women so desperate for men that they disrespect themselves and others. We need movies about women's independence and empowerment, not desperation. This movie was a horrible disappointment."
tt11010144,"I normally do not watch movies like these. Had a time to sit and watch it, the characters lacked any screen chemistry, the directing was too over the top. A rom-com should at least have chemistry and not try to make every scene funny by throwing in random gags.The protagonist and the love interest could act but it still couldn't work on screen. If you want a mild easy movie, by all means you can watch it, but if you treat films like art, you will be disappointed."
tt11010144,"I just want to know, why do you folks keep making these bad movies? Such a bad representation of South African talent and potential. Please stop with these D grade movies. A supposed comedy that doesn't make you laugh not once. Such poor acting, terrible script. Such a waste of data. Hay suka maan!"
tt11010144,"Klishe ,borring and naive,slow.the thing whith accent or sleng is too much,,hard to listen and watch-pls dont do this enymore ."
tt11010144,"Not a great film but a lot of fun to watch. I appreciate being able to see something from someplace other than Hollywood. I thought the two actresses were terrific, and what is up with their fabulous fashions? I haven't seen anything like that in the states!"
tt11010144,Terrible attempt at a rom com. Was not a good movie at all if I could give it zero stars I would.
tt11010144,"I found this film modern and refreshing. Both of the main female actresses were brilliant and had great chemistry together and individually their acting was on point. I found them funny, relatable and easy to watch and the rest off the cast were also great actors. Would like to see more films with the lead actors in it. I also like the Bar manager and found him very natural and believable. Yes it was a typical rom com but I like rom coms and it had a lot of funny scenes, and was refreshing to see a film based in Africa rather than America. Great work to all involved."
tt11010144,"Fun, but these films with women who chase men and / or marriages desperately and at any cost seem so futile and outdated in the middle of the 21st century, the message about self-esteem and self-sufficiency is cool, but the rivalry between women is questionable, still more when the word sorority is on the rise..."
tt11010144,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it was just terrible. The plot is ridiculous, the main character is so annoying and so are all of the other characters for that matter. The only reason I kept watching it because I was hoping the story would somehow save itself...but it never did."
tt11010144,Waste of time and unbelievably bad acting and story
tt11010144,This was easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is no chemistry between the characters and the plot is predictable and boring. It is worse than a made-for-tv movie!Don't waste your time.
tt11010144,"I enjoyed it. There were some good laughs. I liked how easily they spoke all the different languages, kinda cool! But over all the movie was pretty slow, pacing could be improved.I also enjoyed the ending not being the classic film story-line."
tt11010144,"Seriously single is funny, modern, relatable and easy viewing"
tt11010144,Who exactly is rating this? I've watched some pretty crap main stream romcoms with better reviews. This deserves better! It is a bit like a typical cliche romcom but really funny with relatable acting and chemistry between the two main female leads. Really refreshing to watch a funny non American or British movie. A win for SA!
tt11010144,"A young lady longs for commitment while venturing the night life in Johannesburg. Fresh, funny and freaky it's a well done room com with unexpected twists. Very enjoyable."
tt11010144,Just a fun movie to watch. I guess there was nothing new in this movie but still had me laughing.
tt11010144,Typical romantic-comedy/ chick flick following the typical 'Hollywood rom-com format' but still a fresh for viewers unexposed to stories about professional and personal lifestyle of South African millennials in Johannesburg.
tt11010144,"As a producer, I should add that the production of this film is excellent. The sound design, wardrobe(!!), art direction, casting, production design, graphics, color grading and music? Flawless!! This is a WIN for all of the artists and producers responsible. The direction was not terrible, but I have to question the integrity of a director, or in this case two directors, who would feel good about clocking this movie in at almost 2 hours. The editing was fine but sluggish. Again, I blame the directors for it. My earlier review was harsh and I stand by it as a viewer, but as a producer, I have to give this movie added credit. If you dig the art and craft of moviemaking as I do, this is definitely worth watching. But again, don't expect much from the script. It is NOT good."
tt11010144,"3 August 2020: I saw this South African film last night. The entire cast is good, but the comedy award goes to really cute and talented African actress, Fulu Mugovhani. Fulu is adorable to watch from start to finish. Her equally talented big girl co-star, Tumi Morake is also very funny and delivers her comedic timing perfectly. I hope to see Fulu and Tumi together in other films."
tt3910690,"I have to give the show a thumbs down. While the show is still called ""Inspector Gadget"", the episodes typically revolve around Penny. What a waste! And although Gadget's naivety is pushed to the max, all his other personality traits seem to be gone. What about his ironic over-protecting of Penny? What about how he falls for every pretty lady he meets? Why is Brain such a grumpy grump? Why is Penny so awkward? Also, the super high-tech background is so unnecessary. They already had their own technology in the original series. And I definitely don't approve of the forced romance between Talon and Penny. Don't even get me started!"
tt3910690,THINGS THAT ARE WORSE:They completely changed the theme song and not for the better.Gadget is just not quite the same and he isn't very prominent in the episodes. Plus his gadgets seem to be a great deal more lame than they were in the original.Penny is featured too much and she relies heavily on a hand held computer.Brain seems to be stupid and always angry.Dr. Claw is quite lame and really not that menacing.The chief is always getting blown up and he seems to be rather unnecessary.Penny's friend is hardly ever in the stories and she is just kind of window dressing.The stories are not very interesting.Perhaps much younger kids will enjoy it. I am an adult and my whole family always enjoyed the original cartoon series. None of us really care for this version.
tt3910690,"When I first found out they were making a new Inspector Gadget series I was excited and happy since I grew up with the 80's Inspector Gadget. But seeing what they have turned it into made me really disappointed.1. The CGI is hideous and all the characters looks awful. I wish they would have gone back the 80's Inspector Gadget animation style. The 80's animation was beautiful.2. The writing is awful!3. What happened to Brain's character? He seems constantly angry/grumpy.4. What happened to Penny's computer book?5. What happened to Dr. Claw? In the 80's show he used to be a formidable foe, now he is just incompetent.6. The new character Talon was a bad idea.7. The voice casting is bad8. Episodes only last around 10 minutes."
tt3910690,"The original 1980s Inspector Gadget is a classic, that's still funny, thrilling and well-animated and voiced with one of the most memorable theme tunes to an animated show ever. While expectations were very much mixed for this CGI reboot, anything does deserve to be judged on its own merits so a real effort was made in trying not to compare too much.Sadly this reboot is pretty poor, something that the original show's fans will find a slap in the face but actually it fails on its own terms too. The best thing about it is the voice work of Tara Strong as Penny, Strong is a very talented voice actress who performs to a consistently high standard and she brings charm and spunk to Penny (Martin Roach as Claw also has some nice moments in the quieter moments). Penny is also the least bad character in the show despite some awkward moments (especially with Talon), the only one to show any sort of personality, which is of charm and resourcefulness rather than the blandness and buffoonery that the rest of the characters show. The gadgets are sometimes pretty cool, though not as imaginative as the original show's.Conversely, while it was good that the reboot maintained Gadget's original main character qualities they lack the same spark, he may still be unintelligent and gullible but he's also annoying and bland by too much of a supporting character in his own show and taking credit for things he didn't do. Ivan Sherry tries his best and some may argue that he does sound like Don Addams, but to me it sounded like Sherry trying too hard to imitate Addams, except because the writing is vastly inferior here he lacks the comic timing. Instead of being formidable, Dr Claw is too much of a buffoon and it is way overdone, as aforementioned had some nice quietly menacing moments but they're outnumbered by the buffoonery which Roach also overdoes in the voice acting.Talon is an annoying and stereotypical character, and the writers did miss an opportunity by revealing his villainy too early. He and Claw have an interaction that is more reminiscent of Dr and Scott Evil in the Austin Powers films, which felt out of place and saw lots of forced dialogue, even more goofiness- intentional and unintentional- and lack of suspense. The romantic subplot made little sense, had little chemistry and is contrivedly written. Brain is not just underutilised and underplayed with grumpy being pretty much the only emotion he shows, but largely wasted. The writing is incredibly corny, often to an embarrassing degree, and the jokes are too silly, the few times they were good (i.e. the one with the bull in the second episode) they were just mildly amusing. Admittedly so were those of the original's, but they were done with much more charm and imagination and the timing was much crisper, here the worst of it is eyeroll-inducing. Any semi-seriousness that the stories have here are completely lost because the humour dominates so much, and unfortunately it's the kind that might pass muster for young children or those who are not expecting much but will embarrass adults and come close to offending die-hard fans.Inspector Gadget's (2015) story lines disappoint too, not only being too short but not very well paced, Dr Claw's schemes are rushed and too easily resolved (most of them are embarrassing, and enough to insult fans, somebody said that even Dr Evil would reject them and this viewer agrees) and the generally poor execution of the humour that dominates the show gives the show a laboured feel. It does very little with the formula or the 'inspecting' aspects, which get almost completely lost amidst all the additions the reboot brings. The animation is not very appealing apart from a few dynamic moments in the technological parts, a lot of the character designs are stiff and for CGI this is flatly coloured and hurriedly and sparsely detailed stuff, CGI has come on a lot when executed right but one wouldn't think so looking at the animation here. Musically, there is little memorable and, while one wasn't expecting the use of the old theme tune, surely they could have come up with something better than what they did come up with, this theme tune sounded like it was devised in minutes.Overall, not a complete waste of time but pretty poor. 3/10 Bethany Cox"
tt3910690,"Boom! Did you hear that sound? Something tells me another childhood favourite has bitten the dust and has been replaced by a lifeless CG version.Oh my, the word's gone out. It's poor old Inspector Gadget. Oh man, one of my big childhood heroes. We all know what the original series was like, it had good animation, funny jokes and memorable characters.But no, I'm not here to praise the original like some happy type of guy who just had his first taste of coffee, I'm here to say that this so-called ""updated"" version ain't worth your time.There, I said it.What, you want more? Alright then. I'll have to think of cunning ways to tell you why you shouldn't watch it.Ooh, I know. What if I told you that Inspector Gadget has been turned into an annoying and bumbling fool who falls other every time just to get a cheap laugh from the audience? Will that turn ya off? No. Okay, what if I told you that Dr Claw isn't menacing in the slightest and has an actor who overacts so much you'll pine for the days of Frank Welker?Oh and even better, what if I said he has a new sidekick who is irritating? Still not enough.Jeez, you're a tough one.Well, how about the ugly and unappealing animation that looks rushed and dull? Or the fact it's the usual Canadian toon that has 2 segments nowadays in one episode which means everything is rushed? Is that fine for ya?Hold on a minute, no one's here. Damn, must have been talking to myself. Sigh, I think I might as well stick a DVD of the old and far better Gadget on. And to anyone who was listening, don't watch it, it ain't worth it. There's only so much we can do with our lives..."
tt3910690,"The classic 1983 Inspector Gadget was one of my all-time favorite animated TV shows growing up. However, this revival series from WildBrain is incredibly monotonous and insulting. It focuses too much on childish writing and lacked heart. #1: the titular character, Inspector Gadget, never has any significance in any episode, and feels like he's been reduced to a forgettable side character. #2: the main villain, Dr. Claw, has been reduce to being painfully ignorant, juvenile and less threatening, and acts even more incompetent than his henchmen or nephew combined. #3: Dr. Claw's nephew, Talon, is incredibly arrogant and annoying, and his love/hate rivalry with Penny feels cliched and forced. #4: Gadget's niece Penny, and well as Brain, take up way too much of the spotlight, and act like she's the main character of the series instead of her uncle. #5: Literally every episode is about Dr. Claw doing malicious things for the most boring and juvenile reasons, then Penny and Brain do all the competent work while Gadget does absolutely nothing but saves the day with dumb luck all the time, rinse and repeat. Plus, seasons three and four made me rage quit. #6: The writing also lacks sincerity, opting for shallow, juvenile and contrived plot lines. Plus, any actual humor or character growth has been sacrificed for cheap jokes and outdated cliches. Finally, bizarrely this Canadian series is only available on Netflix in America, but aired reruns on Universal Kids after the show ended in late 2018. So releasing a Canadian cable TV show on an American streaming platform feels pointless. The only positive thing about this reboot is that one of the animators that worked on this show, Alex Henderson, later made one of my favorite independent animated short films on YouTube, The Rhino and the Redbill. So in conclusion, the 2015 Inspector Gadget reboot is incredibly lackluster and disappointing."
tt3910690,"Inspector Gadget was always silly so I can't be mad at the silliness in the new show. The jokes aren't horrible most of the time and Gadget himself is his normal useless brand of crazy. The animation is a nice stylized upgrade. Penny's technology upgrade is great, I wondered how they would work with her old book and this is a nice change. Speaking of Penny, always great to hear Tara Strong at work. Gadget's voice is a great impression of the original. The introduction of Talon struck me as a little off though, he is growing on me but he is like a goofy version of Scott from Austin Powers while Dr. Claw is more like Dr. Evil. I do like how he is competent though giving Penny a challenge. And of course most of the day's problems are solved due to Gadget being basically a creature of chaos with unpredictable actions. So it is far from perfect, the theme is lacking too, but over all there are far worse things out there."
tt3910690,This show is very good. My wife and I grew up with the original series and I see this as an improvement. We have a 4 year old daughter and she loves it. The show is perfect for say 3-6 year old kids and fun also. I like the updates the more involvement of Penny the addition of Talon. The show actually has a running theme you can follow it. My daughter wants to play Inspector Gadget quite often she has seen all the episodes on Netflix more than once. We recently saw some of the old show on Hulu and viewing the two this is just so much better. Gadget in the original was just too dumb they left him dumb but in a more believable way. The people that hate this show I just think they don't have kids and see what kids shows are like and how good this is in comparison. I hope they make more episodes.
tt3910690,"In my opinion, this show is amazing! I love it! It's quirky and funny and just overall adorable. Also, some other people have addressed their dislike for Talon, and I don't understand why you don't like him. He's great! Well anyway, just wanted to share my opinion. Later!
(Btdubs you're doomed)"
tt3910690,"I personally loved it! I have not seen much of the original series, but I absolutely loved this. A lot of people keep comparing it to the original, an saying it's not as good, but this is a whole different series, not really a squeal. It's bright and fun, and besides a few underwear type comments, perfectly appropriate for all ages. It's not violent at all really, and they don't even shoot bullets, they shoot bubble gum. Which I kinda think is cute.I hear a lot of complaints on the animation, cause it's more 3D and such. But kids love that kind of animation, and i don't mind it. There is a tiny bit of light flirting and romance between Penny and Talon, a bit of a Romeo and Juliet type of thing, but it's not overboard or inappropriate for little ones. Honestly, Penny and Talon's interactions are one of the reasons I like this show so much. Also, some teens and adults like watching it too, so not always just for kids. There is actually a whole fandom online of fans.I loved this show, and would highly recommend it for kids, or anyone who likes a good and cute cartoon, with a bit of goofiness."
tt3910690,"First off, I never saw the original, nor the two live action movies, so I have no idea what I might be missing, though I don't mind the 3D as much as some.Some users complain about the apparently new character Talon to match Penny, but I have to say, their classically Hawksian teenage banter between one good and one bad is mainly why I keep coming back. Maybe I'm a slobbering softy without knowing it, dunno. Oh, that and a helicopter in your hat ... how can you go wrong with that‽‽‽It's silly and fun and spies and constant explosions and malfunctions. Brilliant Netflix pick for the-day-after."
tt3910690,"I admit that when I saw the first few episodes that I was not all that impressed by this sequel series. I missed the original theme song and the characters were just not quite the same. However, as the series moved into Season 2, and then Season 3, it gets better (or maybe you just adjust to the characters I don't know). You just have to get past expecting this to be some kind of reboot and see this for what it is; a newly designed series of Inspector Gadget.This series has some subtle adult content going on between Penny and Talon. Most kids, however, would be oblivious to what is happening.Inspector Gadget is even funnier in his level of bumbling into solving the cases he is assigned. Dr. Claw is just as silly as Gadget in choosing his villainous capers too.Bottom line: Some humor is more subtle than others. This humor in this series is not subtle; this series is designed to be so outwardly silly that you laugh at what is happening. Once you realize this, it is quite enjoyable to watch!"
tt3910690,"Inspector Gadget is certainly an interesting franchise. The idea of a bumbling agent who can barely do a good job could be tiring, but the idea works considering it spawned at least 3 shows. I don't remember much from the original shows, so I can't compare. As for this show, it's a lot of fun. The show is focused primarily on comedy, and it succeeds in that regard since each episode is super funny. Of course, there is still some semblance of a story. Despite the title, the protagonist in this show is Penny, Gadget's niece, and she's lots of fun. She's shown to be a pretty competent agent while having plenty of adorkable moments. It helps to have Tara Strong voice her. Gadget is incompetent, but I never get annoyed by him. Dr. Claw and Talon are pretty funny with how over the top they are. I don't really have anything to complain about. This show is great."
tt3910690,"Even though it's now in CGI, all the characters from the 80s version are there with voices close enough to the original that it doesn't really matter. On top of that, the humor from the original is perfectly recreated in this version and there's multiple callbacks to the original series from the intro to scenes in the episodes.Perhaps the only thing I can be negative on is the new design of the Gadgetmobile and perhaps the new Dr. Claw but neither of those are truly jarring enough to make this a bad reboot. There's also a nice touch in using more modern technology like Penny's new equipment. If you're a fan of the original, give this new version a shot. It's worth it in my book."
tt3910690,"I saw this on Netflix and got excited because now my kids and watch another one of the shows I grew up with and not have to suffer through the old one with bad sound and animation. It's hard for me to old stuff since animation has improved so much. I can not get enough of computer animation and wish they could re do everything like this. Penny is great and I love that she can view stuff high tech instead of that clunky computer. Talon is a nice touch, you gotta put someone new in there right? I love his name. I think its so much better then the old one. Dr. Claw is my favorite I love his voice and as hard as he tries to be evil he is actually pretty funny, I like him much better then the old Claw. My kids are obsessed with the show and I hope the seasons continue. They did a fantastic job with it. Me and my husband both watch it with our kids and we both very much enjoy it."
tt3910690,"I personally really like the show. I haven't seen much of the old one. Many people probably don't like it because it is a reboot of a classic. And it has changed a lot from the original. This happens with many other popular TV shows, leaving many people who grew up with the series to not like it. From what I've seen, I think this one is more colorful and funny. I do think this one's better. With all the new characters it provides a fun twist on the original. Although it is hard to compare them seeing that they are still different. I would still recommend watching it. You can watch either without seeing the other."
tt3441810,"If this nightmare was intentionally made to be the worst thing on television, it would be an instant cult hit. Heck, maybe that is what's going on and the joke is ultimately on all of us offering a serious review.It is indeed just as bad as everyone else has claimed. There aren't many things that actually make my skin shrink by three sizes when I watch it, but this does the trick every time.That being said, like all other shows that make my hair grow in reverse, my kids can't get enough. I don't get it at all, but I don't need to because this show is not made for buzzkillers like me."
tt3441810,"I noticed something with people reviewing this show, they either hate it or love it, but i kinda say i'ts funny at times, but it's also annoying and obnoxious at a rare occasion. I say that you should give it a try, but it is not so bad, but also not incredible."
tt3441810,"My daughter has been watching this on Netflix and I'm going to have to make her stop. If you want to watch a show with simply awful acting where the characters are shallow, rude, and stupid, this one is for you. I literally can't stand having it play in my home. We all lose brain functionality every time it's on. Can't believe it made it through 3 seasons!"
tt3441810,"I simply hate my life when my children have this on the TV. I appreciate the thought, but the acting is awful, the timing is awful, and the way they portray the characters is horrible. The two characters who are supposed to be the ""good looking"" ones are portrayed as airheads. I just can't. But, there's no cussing or sexual themes, so I suppose I'll allow it."
tt3441810,"I can't even imagine how someone in authority gave this the green light. It is unimaginably bad. I'm not using hyperbole either. This literally has no redeeming factors. Absolutely none. I feel embarrassed for the 'actors', and I use scare quotes because nothing that these 'actors' do could be even closely defined as such. It's an insult to actors everywhere. Did they give them classes to get so bad? I mean, you see the occasional bad actor in kids shows, but this show's entire cast must be made up of high school drama club rejects. Yes, it really is that bad. Sometimes I will rate a show or movie 1 star because of how badly it failed to meet expectations, but this one gets 1 star because it genuinely deserves it. Don't ever let your kids watch it because you will love to regret it."
tt3441810,"Okay, it's a bit cheesy, but quite charming and full of puns and innocent humor. I enjoy watching this with my 8 and 10 year old. 😁"
tt3441810,"Some of the reviewers on here are way too harsh for what this show is - it's a kids show. It's for KIDS. I personally find it hilarious at times, and much more watchable than some of the Disney or Nickelodeon shows I'm forced to watch.It's got a fast pace and lots of jokes, and yes it's silly, but that's it's charm. And unlike some of the other jaded reviewers on here, I find the kids extremely talented. I hope they all continue to act.For a kid's show it's a 10. For general audience a solid 7. Give it a try on Netflix if you have a kid who is around 7-8 and see what their reaction is. My daughter loves it and I enjoy watching it too."
tt3441810,"Well, it does one or two things well. I enjoyed the character Piper, (Charlie Storwick) and one episode where they have a beauty pageant. (except for the preachy and forced ending.) Other than that, the show ranges from mediocre to terrible. The humor is forced, and the laugh track really doesn't help either. The characters (Save for Jarvis) are stereotypes. Geneva is the dumb blonde obsessed with her looks, Bowie is the nerd (yet he somehow manages to be almost as dumb as Geneva), Piper is the tech nerd\Goth Chick, Aster is the shortest of the bunch, and a fashion obsessed jerk, and Knox is the dumb jock. I understand that it's a kid's show, but kids aren't dumb. I think it needs to make actual characters and have them develop throughout the story instead of making cardboard cut outs."
tt3441810,"The problem with people's terrible summarizations are: well, they say it's terrible and then give no basis for it. As for a kid's sitcom, it's pretty good. Also, an opposition to a laugh track is ridiculous; it's not hurtful... Why are you complaining about it? After you watch and binge enough sitcoms to tune out the laugh track, it's basically not there. Now, to the people who say they are going to put their children up for adoption if they continue to watch the show, and this is a serious comment. Screw you, you are going to burn in hell."
tt3441810,"No there are no lessons to learn, and yes the plot is razor thin, but with the rest of today's programming having adult concepts sprinkled into their shows it is refreshing to have a clean show that my kids can watch. There needs to be more programming like this out there."
tt3441810,"I really like the idea on which the TV Series is built. The cast is great as well as the production, but something feels wrong while you are watching. It's hard to explain but it seems to be ""home made"". I blame the pacing of the show, the editing, those fractions of time between the lines, the timing of the laughs, some void between dialogues... It just feels an unnatural flow, like forced. Like that play in grade six where kids are waiting for their cue to say their lines. My two kids, in middle and elementary school, say this is the show they like least of YTV (Canadian Network similar to Nickelodeon). We find that a lot of episodes have such a lousy story, not funny at all and with very basic plots with dull resolutions, sometimes we just don't laugh at all during the whole show, and what's the point of a comedy that is not funny. Yes, there are some episodes that we have enjoyed and had a good laugh, especially with Mrs Bubkes, but not enough to give the show a better rating."
tt3441810,"""Why should we be punished to do Math?"" Are you kidding me? These stereotypes really damage students' attitudes towards math. Maybe inspire for a change. 
Overall, this show is a bunch of obnoxious scenarios that contribute nothing unique or noteworthy to entertainment."
tt3441810,The fact anyone would let their child watch this is disturbing.
tt3441810,"Awful show for kids, for example in the first episode, the girl with blonde was reading a magazine and she though when it said shorter it meant short skirts, and all the guys said ""its does"" and ""the shorter the better"" which is clearly disrespectful since the girl clearly didn't understand. This show is normalizing disrespect towards young and all girls in general, its teaching children that's saying stuff like that's okay."
tt3441810,Some Assembly Required is one of the best TV shows I've ever seen! Some people have been saying bad things about this show but I think they're wrong. It's one of the funniest and best comedy shows on Earth. I am 7 years old and my Dad loves it a lot too. He even laughs at it!
tt3441810,"This show has some really bad reviews, which compelled me to make a review of my own. I like this show, loved it as a kid, and recently just kinda decided to watch it all again. I thought ""hey I'll just watch a few episodes as a little blast to the past!"". I watched it all. It's amusing, dumb, entertaining, surreal and cheesy. Like seriously, to all the grumpy grumps reviewing this, what more can you expect from a kids sitcom? I genuinely laughed from some of the jokes made in this show, It's so on the nose to the point that it's funny. Is it perfect? Of course not. The production value isn't fantastic, some themes are poorly executed and there aren't great plot lines. Is it still entertaining? Yup. Now I've seen some people call the acting bad, and I actually disagree with that. I think the actors are good, and this is because to me it is clear that they are doing what they've been asked to do by their director. Being goofy. The energy and emotion they put into the show is great and I'd bet they'd be great in other stuff if I ever saw them! I'm gonna be real with you, I'd be lying to you if I didn't say some of these scenes and lines haven't been stuck in my head ever since I saw them for the first time when I was like eight. As a kid I saw a lot of sitcoms on Disney Channel, nickelodeon and whatever, and the truth is that it's unique. It's so surreal I haven't seen anything really like it, and it's certainly much more original than a lot of other kids shows out there. So I just want to thank you Some Assembly Required, for entairtaning me as a child and giving me some good laughs as an adult."
tt3441810,Worst show I've ever seen in my life. If my son chooses to continue to watch this garbage I may have to put him up for adoption. Hopefully by tomorrow he will come to his senses. We are on the first episode. I'm 12 minutes in and I literally can not take it any longer. That laugh track is enough to send you over the edge. Is is necessary to play the laugh track after every other sentence??? This makes me want to cancel Netflix for the rest of my life. The fact that this show has multiple seasons Blows my mind.
tt3441810,"Absurd, funny and well thought. I love it - and I am far away from the target age."
tt3441810,This is one of the worst shows I have ever seen. Even for a kids show this show is incredibly stupid with some of the worst writing and acting I have ever witnessed on TV.
tt3441810,"The show was obviously written by a bunch of monkeys. The jokes are dirty and make no sense whatsoever. All the characters in the show are all stupid and are completely oblivious to their surroundings. The humor is dry and does not have high ratings. It's obvious the makers of this show were trying to rope in a quick buck. It's not a funny show and should not air. Take your chances and watch something better or perhaps instead of watching this maybe you should go have a root canal instead. It's better than watching this garbage. If I were to rate this show, I would probably give it a 1. What I mean by all the characters are stupid, THERE ALL STUPID! No clue in the world whatsoever on how to do things"
tt3441810,Why is this even on Netflix!!! It's sooooo dumb! 3/10 rating
tt3441810,"Sorry I hate to be cruel but I couldn't help myself and this show really is scraping the bottom of the barrel so hard that the bottom of the barrel is wearing away. ""Some Assembly Required"" is truly a terrible TV watching experience and in my opinion it fails badly on every level.The writing is absolutely atrocious with fake and hackneyed dialogue and jokes that literally make me cringe time and again. You can usually tell exactly what the joke is going to be and basically get buried under an avalanche of terrible punch lines and then an over the top, desperate laugh track.The acting is also terrible. I know these are just children, or teens playing children and young adults playing teens, but they're just not very good. Every single cast member misses the mark. Of course this isn't entirely their fault... like I said the writing is terrible and the casting department really missed the mark here as well.The effects are also complete rubbish. I mean, every single thing about this show is just cheap and bad. I can't believe this lasted more than one season, or that it even made it on the air at all. Spectacularly bad TV."
tt13887518,"Just how big fat indian weddings are planned & executed is shown. The wedding planners part won't interest much & gets way too boring sometimes.
Every wedding involve atleast one new way of challenging/ditching the traditional customs that are happening since ages (you may support it or find it a bit extra) but that's sort of main highlight of every wedding other than nothing interesting in series to watch. You can skip it."
tt13887518,How long Netflix will be milking the same cow? It is just reshooting of old .. nothing exciting to watch again.
tt13887518,"The people and weddings featured were definitely interesting and the cinematography was stunning, it's such a shame that this was so poorly produced in every other aspect. First and foremost...the most egregious error...let's talk about the music. SO WRONG. Clayton Hogermeer's ""I Love You Like"" is a lovely song...and it's the worst possible choice for a show about big fat Indian weddings. I could've born it...just skipped the intro and watched the episode...but the sappy so-not-Indian soundtrack continues throughout each episode. I tried watching.""A Family Affair"" (""Collection 2"")...kept waiting for the slow intro montage to end and for the episode to begin in earnest but no...it's a full 45 minutes of Shaadi montage with a jarringly western score (again, it's nice music, but it's so out of tune with what you're watching...how on earth did everyone involved in this production agree that this was the way to go?) I'm so bummed, would've really loved to watch and enjoy the beautiful footage and some lengthier interviews (as opposed to a stream of snippets set to sappy songs) but I just couldn't take another minute."
tt13887518,"What a boring look into these nonsensical events...that have only one goal: spending a ridiculous amount of money to get some kind of social recognition/status. Instead of impressing the viewer the show only succeeds in showing how annoying are these bridezillas, spending a lot of energy for a shallow and ephemeral event. Weddings seem to be primordial events in the indian society and sadly the show focuses on the organization of the event and not it's deep social meaning."
tt13887518,"I really wanted to enjoy this show. The idea of an extravagant display of fake celebration is never a good idea for a show. I would have rather preferred to watch how a middle class family celebrates the best wedding day based on a budget. I feel like that's something majority of folks, both Indian or otherwise would prefer to see. This show is just a recurring reminder of what's called ""paisa bolta hai"" (money speaks)."
tt13887518,Stupid and utterly wierd show. Netflix india is trying ti destroy hinduism.
tt13887518,"Bringing a lot of modern takes to an otherwise patriarchal industry, the show is all about celebrating the couple and their choices.Doing weddings more for individual happiness than putting on a facade for guests - this is essentially all what the show is about. The three episodes revolve around this theme with a lot of cute adorable decor stuff.Good for an idle Sunday noon watch. Disappointed just a tad bit because it still doesn't quite comes across as something with a lot of depth or substance.It's visually pretty but entirely forgettable."
tt13887518,Non-sense and annoying weddings spreading wrong message of wasting money and ditching customs.
tt13887518,"Pretentious, show offs rich people spending absurd amount of money on lavish weddings which makes no sense. I would have loved if they had shown a contrast of how a poor and an average Indian family gets married along with these rich snobs."
tt13887518,This series shows the modern Indian brides and their point of view about marriage. It invokes a thought process of the things which matter in wedding. Past rituals which do not promote equality of a man and a woman in married life should most definitely be removed.
tt13887518,This show was a waste of time and more than that it was also showing Hinduism in a very bad light. I especially hated Pallavi who provided a horrendous misinterpretation to the beautiful ritikal of Kanyadaan. I hope she receives good education someday.
tt13887518,"Zero 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼 Worse movie nothing new here.

tt13887518,No mention of love or sacrifice ... Just a vulgar display of excess wealth in a never-ending and thoroughly meaningless parade of gaudiness. I don't think India learned anything from Mother Theresa.
tt13887518,It captures and glorifies extravagant weddings held by crazy rich Indians. The display of wealth is intimidating. That's all it is. Nothing else.
tt13887518,"So we binged Netflix Indian Matchmaking quite a lot and now we see 4 uber big and 2 decent indian styled weddings of couples that knew each other for a long time.
I don't care for the vanity and extravagance but the weddings are beautifully shot.
If you try to find insight into the Indian wedding industry you may want to give Amazons Made in Heaven a chance but if you want enjoy modern Indian weddings in a MTV video clip style this is your menu.
Sadly it is devoured only after 3 short episodes."
tt13887518,This has to be on of the most pathetic shows that I ever watched on OTT platform.
tt13887518,Worst thing I have seen in netflix. Don't watch it. You will be wasting your precious time.
tt23458218,"Story and acting seems excellent specially for ivana alawi but as a fan we need more dare romantic Scenes also because its better than anything I ever watched so far. And it was a beautiful and captivating love story. The chemistry between the lead actors was electric and their performances were both moving and convincing. The film's visuals and soundtrack were also stunning, adding to the overall romantic atmosphere. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a heartwarming and enjoyable romantic movie experience. The film's setting was picturesque and added to the overall romance of the story. The pacing was perfect, with just the right balance of humor and drama. Overall, it was a delightful and enjoyable movie that left me feeling uplifted and inspired. Highly recommended for fans of the genre."""
tt0415908,"Plot Outline: Tourists Dev (Vivek Oberoi), Ishika (Lara Dutta) and two friends explore Orbit National Park, a tiger haven. They meet Wildlife experts Krish (John Abraham) and Riya (Esha Deol) who are exploring recent mysterious man-eater killings for National Geographic Channel. They are joined by Kali (Ajay Devgan) who takes up the challenge of guiding them though the mysteries of the jungle.Comment: Kaal is pot-pourri of Ram Gopal Verma and Karan Johar's styles since Writer/Director Soham had been an assistant to both. RGV's style is visible in the thriller plot, pale ghosts and bizarre deaths. Johar didn't forget to cast SRK, this time in an Item number. The movie shares similarities with Ghost and the Darkness, Wrong Turn, etc.There isn't much acting to see, thanks to the incoherent script and lack of room for characters to grow. Music is decent; choreography is stereotype. Jim Corbett National Park is well captured. No wonder they are facing a suit for the alleged violation of the Wildlife act.Rating: 2/5"
tt0415908,"I watched the promos. I didn't really pay much attention to the promos. The first screening and boom, so many videos on youtube. The one of SRK's item song really got me to go and watch the film. I sat through the first 20 - 30 minutes...bored. Then it picks up. The ending is very ironic. This movie is very hyping. My ratings for this movie are 1) Story - 9/10; 2) Direction - 7/10 (The Weaker point); 3) Performances - 8/10; 4) Character Development - 8/10; 5) Overall - 8/10. In my point of view, this movie is nice. If you're not such a big fan of thrillers, then this is not for you to watch because it is...well... it's a thriller."

There's a much more dangerous threat lurking in the reels of this debacle! It appears as if the whole cast is infected with a virus that induces horrendously low levels of acting! In what must be a brilliant achievement- Soham has managed to extract impossibly bad performances not only from 'specialists at bad acting' like Esha Deol and Lara Dutta, but even from the talented Vivek Oberoi and the highly gifted Ajay Devgan. That leaves us with John Abraham. Don't worry, he's pathetic too! We are first introduced to his toned abdomen while he is running and then, shown him serenading with a python! Some gay fantasy, this! Thankfully, we are also informed that he works with the National Geographic and has a wife, Riya(Esha Deol). Krish(Johnny boy!) and Riya head off to the jungle of Orbit Park to investigate an increasing number of suspicious killings, apparently by tigers. Jungle mein mangal? Orbit(Corbett rechristened?!?) Park incidentally boasts the largest number of tigers in India. Also on their way to this tigerland are a group of city-bred animals- Dev(Vivek Oberoi), Ishika(Lara Dutta), Vishal(Vishal Malhotra) and Sajid(Kushal Punjabi). A car-breakdown and a 'mrityunjaya mantra' reciting weirdo(Vineet Sharma) later, our animals encounter the python-lover and his lover! A few more reels and a few more killings! Enter Kali Pratap Singh(Ajay Devgan), a mysterious villager who offers to help them get out of the jungle. All things aside, Ajay Devgan's entrance is a crackling scene that actually gives one the goose bumps, unlike the creepy scenes which were meant tobut never do! The time by which this bunch runs away from the jungle, a few more surprises are revealed. A good student of cinema will see the twist coming a long way before it actually does. And while that takes away from the thrill of the revelation, what hurts more is the script's sudden jumping of genres. A bad case of identity crisis- the script is unsure whether it is a thriller or a horror! So while the movie promises you a wild thriller in the first half, it resorts to the supernatural in the latter half! The screenplay moves at a turgid pace with no significant episode in the first three-quarters of an hour. Desperate attempts at making the audiences jump from their seats result in loud guffaws. Sample this- we are led to believe that an anonymous hand is about to cause some terror to a character only to be revealed that the hand in question is the character's own! Hands down, the most stupid scene! Also stupid is Lara Dutta exercising her vocal chords in a role that she has screamed her way through! Vivek Oberoi makes more facial contortions than a constipated man while Esha Deol redefines poor acting and looks like she's straight out of a lingerie ad for a tiger-skin brassiere! The usually dependable Ajay Devgan is made to mouth lines that are far below his acting quotient. The only decent act comes from Vineet Kumar as Bagga. The sound by Dwarak Warrier is brilliant but overused to a nauseating effect. In a nutshell, Dharma is no Varma! All the monkey-screeches, tiger-roars, owl-howls and Lara-screams add up to one excruciating visit to the cinema hall! A toddler behind me kept insisting his father to leave the theater and go home. Actually, he was voicing the sentiments of all present!Abhishek BandekarRating- ** Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent29th April, 2005"
tt0415908,"Kaal was supposed to be the best film of the year before its release. But, as usual bollywood has produced yet another Hollywood style (read copy) time waster. The macho men like Ajay Devagan and Vivek Oberoi also could not save the disaster.Some sequences clearly are copied from ""Final Destination"" and Taran Adarsh of Indiafm says these scenes are the best. I seriously don't understand how come he became a film critic. Tasteless cheap idiot.The promos gave much hype to the movie with tigers and all the stuff. Clearly Soham concentrated more on the promos than the original film. Esha and Lara prove to be a waste. To be frank I don't find a single positive point about the movie except the marketing and pre release promotion.My advice is not to watch the movie and waste your money.Rating **."
tt0415908,"I had seen this film yesterday, considering it to be a Karan Johar & Shahrukh Khan Production, expected much more than the crap that I just saw.The Acting was very poor, plots that were undefined & unexpected, background music that was terrible & reallyyyyyyy nothing scary. It was just a popcorn ride.The film could have been much, much, better than what was imagined & directed by Soham. The plot changed from one part to another & then what do you recognize at the end, it is the same old Indian Masala.Most of the Scenes were copied from Hollywood films which by surprise should not happen under a Huge banner.Well at the end, just would like to say that it was waste of time & money."
tt0415908,"Pride is what caused Kaal. I could somehow feel Karan Johar in each and every shot, and the forced acting, the worst use of the wide angle, funny jungle sounds you could buy on a cheap CD, and of course, Shah Rukh Khan and Mallaika. For a moment it seemed more like a Pepsi Commercial, and a badly directed one at that. Strangers meet in jungle, hacked one by one, until they come upon the big secret, something that you'll guess anyway within the first fifteen minutes of the movie. the only person it might fool is someone sleeping through the movie. The Director must have really begged to get this chance, and Karan Johar must have been desperately bored. Some claim this film is a hit. Of course it will be. That's why Shah Rukh appears at the beginning, to tell us: ""it's all right! this kind of crap is endorsed by me, see?"" The movie is an insult to the paying-public. Of course, only a Karan Johar can get away with such blatant disrespect, with his already immoral films setting the trends for today's youngsters. while aditya chopra strives for morals, karan johar exploits the lack of it. True, he does vibe well with the public. But for how long?"
tt0415908,"When you have a reputable banner, Dharma Productions, BIG stars-Shah Rukh Khan and Karan Johar, and a fantastic publicity campaign backing a film, you KNOW the movie will make money. The fantastic start that KAAL has got at the box office is obviously, no surprise. But, the movie, dear Dharma productions, is sad, bad and very boring.The movie is about John Abraham, a tiger expert working for National Geographic, his photographer wife, Esha Deol who goto Orbit Park to unearth the secrets of man-eating tigers. Surprisingly, this happens without any information to the channel, and they just land up there and try explore. The story then brings in Vivek Oberoi, Lara Dutta and their two friends, all of whom are on vacation, and as their car breaks down, a sudden turn of events lands them at Orbit Park, and after they meet Abraham and Deol, the story moves on. They meet the tigers and Ajay Devgan later, and soon tragedies happen around them, and I wouldn't spoil that for anyone who'd want to see this ridiculous excuse of a movie, which has no narrative and pace.Soham tries to make his audience THINK. Like Oberoi lighting the cigarette and Abraham making that scary face. Obviously, the audience add two and two and make i four, but Mr. Soham is no Hitchcock. Dude, when you throw in something confusing at least offer an explanation for it. THAT's what makes the movie interesting and adds repeat value. Remember when Kevin Spacey says ""the greatest trick the devil ever pulled off was to convince the world that he did not exist"" or when Haley Joel Osement says ""I see dead people around...the big problem is they themselves do not know they're dead""...well, it all had a meaning! Oberoi saying ""smoking kills"" and then smoking, eeesh! Care to explain? There are a gazillion more loop holes! A lot of people have spoken about the 'mixed reactions' the movie as got. Heck, the movie has got bad reviews everywhere, except for from Mr. Taran Adarsh, leading trade analyst. And that makes me think, why and how. Quite simply, he is obsessed with everything Karan Johar and ShahRukh Khan do. And he has no qualms about it either. He'd even rate admittedly bad things from the Khan-Johar camp and make them sound good. So, when such a reputed analyst rates the film so highly, most of the audiences are given further incentive to go watch the film.I remember when DHOOM released, Mr. Adarsh very categorically said that ""after the initial hype, this movie will die down"". Taran, DHOOM was still an entertainer. KAAL, to which you give 4 stars out of 5, is dull. You may love Johar and SRK, but call a spade a spade man! I'd give this movie a */***** and that too for the brilliant sound, and the very first item number on SRK and the hot hot Malaika. The movie is downhill from there. Of course, SRK and Johar would go laughing to the bank, but guys, please don't torture us like this anymore."
tt0415908,Well this movie is not like the typical Bollywood horror movie. It has its different tone. Screenplay is good. But lacks story and the climax can easily be predicted. Good cast but the acting has little surprised me because all are overreacting except Ajay Devgn. Ajay Devgn was superb in the movie and fit to play the character that he plays. Otherwise just decent watch you can give it a try. It's not that horror but it's a good thriller.....
tt0415908,"Shahrukh Khan & Karan Johar's KAAL is an apt example of Cinema gone Wrong in a big way.......Since there were LOt of References to make from .....The Ghost & The Darkness, The Wrong Turn, Blair witch Project & of the like......The film should not have gone wrong.....but the crappy twist & the faulty screenplay takes away the charm that Actors(Mainly: Ajay Devgan & John Abraham) & the Technical Team(Santosh Thundiyil....Take A Bow....)packs it....Soham is a Good Craftsman...But not a Fine Story-teller...he should not have wasted the great production on such a inept story....Maybe he can tell a apt story next time ..... ..... Overall Expectation Ruined...... Good story Turned Faulty......"
tt0415908,"(MIS) Cast - John Abraham, Esha Deol, Vivek oberoi, Lara Dutta, Ajay devgan, Kushal Punjabi and Pameet Sethi, The movie is all about why it is happening at the ORBIT National Park, (Jim Corbet Netional Park, Uttranchal , India (RENAMED)). Any ways what was so strange there. Some mysterious killings. but as it is well known (rumored) that it is being done by a MANEATNG tigers group!!!!!!! And guess who is going there to find out what is behind the scene, (A photographer from National Geographic channel)John Abraham,- Can some body answer where are Indian FOREST OFFICERS, (ON LEAVE/or every one left the ""Orbit "" National Park, because they know a natgeo photographer will be here to find this out)-. was there with his Wife (Esha Deol).and then there was Vivek Oberoi and party, vivek with his Girl Friend Lara Dutta and Kushal Punjabi plus Vihsal , (Point to be noted ) they met in a way that Vivek Oberoi's (Re Technitioned)LAND CRUISER and NAT GEO's TATA SAFARI or Mahindra SCOPIO (or something like that) both broke down and they got lift from a man diving Maruti Gypsi (moral of the story Land Crusier is not meant for Safari Ride ). Interesting.after that three or four accidents while safari. Sound Defects (i repeat defects) -a Match stick flame felt like a blast - what will u call it EFFECT!!!!!!! oh enough of sound effects thing, where is Ajay Devgan, so here he is just before Intermission to save the life of our worthy heroic group, (mylord point to be noted Vishal was filming the scene on his SONY handy cam) .after some two or three mysterious killing they found the real Culprit and they escape from jungle for the sake of life because they can not kill any body who is all ready dead.They got the secret and escaped . And the most hilarious part of the movie ---> a NATGEO photographers generates his task report and wrote it as ""all is done by a bhoot(GHOST) and not by the MANEATING TIGER!!!!!!!!"", who is the Ghost???? - sorry sir i am not supposed to destroy a movies business for this u have to watch the movie. Better wait for VCD/DVD and rent it, because the movie is not a worth keepingwhat is done by actors -- nothing!!! Lara, John and Ajay were quite talented from my point of view, before i had seen the movie. Vivek and Esha are again a not to talk about thing.and this movie seems to be a long advertisement of SONY and NATGEO. the movie starts from a great count of media and official partners.No awards on counting them, yet been declared by Dharma productions and Red Chillies. Do watch it if u want to kill u KAAL(TIME). Guys this is not KAAL this is AKAAL of one good Bollywood thriller.2 out of ten."
tt0415908,"Pros and Cons of KaalPros: 1. Title Song 2. some very few chilling scenes 3. Dwarak Warrier has some good sound effectsCons: 1. A supernatural story in the guise of a realistic entertainer. ('Darna Mana Hai' was a much better movie.) 2. Bad Cinematography. Immature use of wide angle shots. 3. Editing is too fast-cut; especially when it comes to showing dead bodies or tiger attacks 4. National Geographic has done a blunder in associating itself with such a storyline. 5. Too many logical mistakes 6. Immature Direction; Soham should have resisted the temptation to use cheap tricks to induce horror. Soham, next time, do a sanity check on the scenes after you shoot them. 7. Jarring background score 8. Bad acting 9. Does not really promote any awareness on tiger conservation or wildlife preservation. 10. Tigers look as if they are on a circus ramp. Don't forget to watch their 'catwalk' during the Ajay Devgan introduction scene."
tt0415908,"This is an ill-conceived, ill-written and ill-directed movie. The infrared shots of the jungle with background sound of crickets does't evoke any admiration for the grossly immature direction. Then there is the venerable Ajay Devgan as ""Kali (Kali Prathap Singh to be precise-to let the viewers know that this reviewer has seen this film), walking out of the woods like Moses, with a bamboo pole (with Manish Malhotra not far behind!)-three tigers walk away with the tail between their legs! truly a jungle Film, there is even magic here. I can't believe a reputable banner like Dharma Productions would be remotely associated with this junk, However I can fully believe someone like Sharukh Khan would be behind this venture, since Junk Films are right up his alley."
tt0415908,"What can anyone say about Kaal? It has to be one of the best Hindi films I have ever seen. It starts off slow, but builds up becoming faster and faster and adding some plot twists and what not. The special effects enhance the movies, and the ending leaves you for a surprise! Shah Rukh Khan has done a great job producing the film, even tho is special appearance in the beginning was disappointing. The acting was phenomenal, and the words as well. A movie by which SRK produces, must be good and this movie lives up to the expectations. Even though it is not a musical, many Hindi film viewers will like the movie despite that fact. There is no doubt that Kaal is one of the best produced SRK movies. Two thumbs up should be given to the movie plus 9 stars out of 10."
tt0415908,"the movie doesn't contain any plot or substance. there are two item number routines, one to start the movie off, and another to end it off.other than these, there is nothing much interesting in the movie.the two actresses try to display as much flesh as possible, which is a little confusing, considering that the whole movie is shot in the middle of a jungle. one must admit that the director has utilized the resources at his disposal in this department well.the tigers don't appear long enough in the script. when they do its quite an artificial scene. hardly something that makes one tremble with fear.biggest issue is the disconnect between the pitching of the movie through its two songs, while the movie has nothing to do with them."
tt0415908,"Kaal  it's all about living up to your promise. Yes, Kaal promised much. A songless thriller from The Karan Johar stable! Set in Jim Corbett, an array of dazzling stars, an item number from the Chaiyya Chaiyya pair and a man eater tiger to moot. And super cool promos which got most of us excited. But alas, kaal is all about a great promo and an ordinary product. It pretty much falls in the slasher fest genre which studiously sticks to the following rules 1.Loud is scary. Yes, every scene is recorded with high pitched sound and screechy noises! Sure there could be a better way of scaring people. 2.The hero's best friends are the first to be killed. Here the character Vishal, dies twice in five minutes, if once was not bad enough. 3.Point the needle of suspicion on the main characters and get them into a scuffle. We do not even get to see John and Vivek fight. The way their girl friends, get them to back off has to be seen to be believed. 4.Have one scary dream sequence in the middle of nowhere, and expect the audience to wake up after that! 5.Headless corpses are a must; throw a couple of them for good effect. But, hey this movie is set in Jim Corbett (read Orbit Park) and we need to talk about tiger conservation. Remember we have a marketing tie up with Nat Geo. Sure show a hanging owl and langoor dangling from a tree every twenty minutes and a python wrapped around John's torso (strong suspicion that Karan insisted on this shot). And John is after all a ""Tiger expert"" working with Nat Geo. The acting skills in a slasher fest are strictly limited to the women shrieking, screaming, running and obviously dressed in skimpy clothes (remember no songs for such displays). And the men , Vivek Oberoi has perfected the art of being Mr. Irritating (with kajal and lipstick make up !) and considering his acting skills are rather limited , one can be rest assured his real life persona is not way different ( now do we blame Sallu for wanting to bash him up). Devgan who has a psychobabble mumbo jumbo background score blaring as he enters, has a staff to cover his face and his intense brooding eyes hope to add to the terror. John looks good and it's a little too much to expect him to act. Yes, Kaal is all this and more! Do watch it, you would never complain about why Karan Johar makes the same kind of KKHH, KHNH, K3G movies. He should leave this genre to the Ramus of the world and not to forget the director of this venture is Soham Ali (he was assistant to both Ramu and Karan prior to this). One piece of advise to Soham, stick to assisting, it's not such a bad thing."
tt0415908,"Amazed by the promos,I happily took the risk of putting my studies apart and watched the movie.And it is necessary to say-I WASTED MY TIME.Truly,a ridiculous movie,with no aim,no theme and no direction(of course we can say this).I was thinking in the whole movie that when the movie will begin?That's true,there was no beginning in the movie.Just a fool effort of horrifying the viewer.And the reason behind all these murders-the ghost,My GOD,how one can write such a boring story.And the ending of the movie was the worst one I ever saw.The only plus point of the movie was it's background score.Salim-Sulaiman done their job quite nicely.The part of the forest officer was forcefully send to the doubt list.With so many flaws,the movie only puts the fame of Johar camp down.DON'T WATCH IT,EVEN AT FREE OF COST,USE TWO HOURS OF YOUR LIFE FOR SOMETHING USEFUL."
tt0415908,"Well, I just finished watching, correction, suffering through the movie and I felt I HAD to express my views somehow. Then I went through the other comments on this movie and realized most of them expressed those same views anyway. Yes, it's true, like everyone else has said, it's a huge waste of time, it's a worthless movie with no substance, and Soham should not be given any creative control ever again.There are two things I am amazed with... I mean the movie was really bad, I can accept that without much surprise, it is almost expected to happen in Bollywood when we're dealing with anything outside the romantic drama genre. But this flick received Karan Johar's support! What was he thinking?! The movie was not entertaining in the least, from start to finish, it simply takes the most boring bits out of the worst thriller or horror movies you may have seen, mashes them together and actually calls itself a movie. Think of it as a movie that starts out like The Ghost and The Darkness and ends like Final Destination, and it is nowhere near as entertaining as either of those movies. I am not going to comment on acting or music or anything else because the basic plot of the movie, and its execution was so horrible and out of place, one can only stare shocked scene through scene that Karan Johar agreed to produce this. Concepts like acting, background music, etc, don't make sense when the basic framework they reside in is pure nonsense. The second thing that amazed me(the first being Karan's backing of this movie) is Ajay Devgan playing the principal character. I was always of the opinion that Ajay Devgan is an actor who follows a good script with the necessary substance, not one of those actors who would sign for a movie with the big banners because they are made by the big banners. Moreover, his character in Kaal is so ridiculous (I am struggling to find any other word to describe it), I am surprised he felt he would be making any sense acting his part out.The peripheral characters are for the most part just as ludicrously scripted. I've read a few reviews elsewhere and comments on IMDb comparing this to an RGV production. Kaal is far from any RGV film, even Darna Mana Hai. It should be noted that at no point in this movie does it actually invoke any emotion in you, it simply drags on and on and the only reason I suffered through the whole thing was so I could write this comment with a clear conscience of having watched it in its entirety. I could speak in more detail about whatever little plot there is but most of you who have not watched it yet would probably still prefer to watch it and judge it for yourself and ignore the majority of the comments here, just as I did. To a certain extent, it is worth doing that, just to see why Karan Johar and Shah Rukh Khan should not be trusted as much as they are now."
tt1729637,"Starting from Wanted, Salman started a special genre of movies which stars a hero which is Crazy, Insane, carries a unique attitude and style of doing things, have a punch line always with him, moves his body in a fashion, no one ever did and creates an aura around him, which overshadows all the other characters in the movie. After Dabang and Ready which just manages to maintain this, Bodyguard takes the Wanted tradition to a new height, spare the ending of the movie. Salman as a Bodyguard named Lovely Singh has a bookish and sincere approach to his job with all the strange rules, which certainly brings smile on your lips. His ""Ahsaan"" dialog, his breathing biceps as a dance step and his ruthless beating black and blue to the Gundas surely makes his fans jumping on their seats.The movie starts with a sensational entry followed by a blasting action sequence of Salman. From the very beginning movie creates its own aura that continues in spite of few longer romantic sequences until movie reaches to last 15 mins. After Salman finishes and breaks down all the possible danger to Karina it was all well taken by the audience, whistling, applauding and shouting in praise and madness.Nobody would have even imagined about such a pathetic ending of a nicely directed movie by Mr. Siddique which seemed to be handed over to some other writer for its ending and director for last few scenes. The end of the movie can very well be the last fighting sequence and everybody in the theater would have gone back with dancing legs, a smile and a tickle about such a Strange but lovable stud hero. Movie completely lose its track in its last 15 mins. Why these twists and turns when movie is actually not intended to be made in such a way.Not to forget, mentioning the marvelous action in the movie which undoubtedly is the best in bollywood in last decade. Music as well as background score is also a positive for the movie. Overall it was again a Sallu movie and quite and entertaining one.Cut this ending and release it again with an alternate one."
tt1729637,"Bodyguard seems to be a follow up of Dabbang and Ready, Salman Khan's previous blockbuster but it seems a more messy mash up of these earlier versions. The film didn't show any promise neither from its trailer neither when the reel starts rolling. As the painfully hilarious proceedings go on there is no way you can concentrate except to wonder how far Salman's star power is going to drag this film. It is evident that the director has put all his test on Salman and played a rather bold step. Not surprisingly the movie will be a crowd pleasure for many a viewer but there a re many who will be fatigued by its lack of plot and tactless story telling.Meant to be a love story the movie is as predictable as a five year old can imagine. But the most painful scenes are the incessant annoying jokes from the side characters and the naive portrayal of the lead character.May be fat jokes were never this bad. In this male star power driven film there is definitely no space for Kareena Kapoor to show her talent. Whatever but as time passes by and peril hovers on the female lead the action scenes we are fed is not that brilliant too. As many previous films have proved that hero worship is not bad for box office but at least they should be made credible enough for all to believe or at best convincing. But no Bodyguard is a far cry from this and instead we get is a lot of crappy and cheap special effects. And the last and the most important scene of unbuttoning Salman's shirt was by far the worst creativity anyone can come up with. Its really sad that after so much of crazy mishaps there was some substance at the climax of the film. Though the writing at the climax should be praised it is too less an too little after two hours of stupidity.At least Salman's charisma works enough for you to wait till the end. Its surprising that a single performance can put such leverage to a film as such. And a special applaud to the song 'Teri Meri' which was much better than all other mediocre tracks. At the end it doesn't seem fair that a single star and a single song put so many audiences through the film. May be such case shouldn't be criticized rather appraised for such a daring feat."
tt1729637,"this is the worst i could ever imagined...stale story line up, stale expressions,awful and mindless south Indian action... Bodyguard featured Salmaan...after giving a crap like Ready what anyone could expect from this.this movie is better than ready but not upto mark of the star cast.... movie is inspired from a a south Indian movie and also from one of Hindi movie's love story... movie contains action,comedy, drama but the only good part in the movie is the music....few songs are good n hummable....this movie is a total waste of money and time because it is awe-fully bad n STALE... so better keep out of this one....."
tt1729637,"With this new EID release of another SALMAN KHAN movie, I would rather like to go for its review in a different mode.First of all let me tell you that as far as the economics of Film Business goes, this has ""A New Blockbuster"" written all over it without any doubt. Releasing on a national EID holiday (on Wednesday), with more than 2,500 prints and 10-15 shows in a multiplex, plus full houses in the single screen theaters too, How can such a film can ever flop, irrespective of its content or quality? Considering the phenomenal fan following of the STAR, it is bound to become a success in any case before even the week starts on Monday. So, if you want to know the box office result of the film, then in all possibilities this should make a hat-trick of Hits for Salman, unless the Indian viewers wake up miraculously from their media created sleep.Now secondly coming to the content of the film, what can one think of the story of a film, with the title BODYGUARD? Obviously it has to be the love story between the Bodyguard and the owner of the body he is guarding. Hence in that respect the film has got nothing new and it remains completely predictable from the first frame itself where the viewer very well knows what he is going to see in the next reels.So it all comes down to the treatment of the film, which sadly is again below the mark and not at all impressive as expected. Salman's magic is there for sure, but he is not given the perfect action or entertaining sequences which can win over the viewers as compared to his WANTED or DABANGG. The humor is pretty lifeless and sounds outdated with all 80s kind of jokes which fail to create the required impact. However, it seems that the writers were very much aware of its boring plot and therefore they thought of adding an unexpected twist towards its climax. But, believe me, this last reel addition is one of the most bizarre climaxes I have ever seen, written very poorly without any kind of sane, real life vision.In few words, it's a big disappointment in almost all its departments ranging from the story, script, direction and execution. Though the stars acts convincingly putting best of their efforts, but they alone are not capable of giving you a good time in the theater. Honestly speaking, I enjoyed only the first opening song when SALMAN enters the screen in the entire film and was really thinking why this was chosen to be re-made in Hindi since it had nothing to rave about in its script and content.Nevertheless, SALMAN is there with all his trademark moves in the film, along with doing another kind hearted gesture for his own real life bodyguard, Tiger. Very sportingly Salman wears the uniform of Tiger's own Security Agency and also makes Tiger dance standing next to him in the opening song. I guess that's one of the reason, why SALLU BHAI is loved all over the world for his numerous similar kind of humble, friendly acts.To end the review, I would like to tell you that why I almost walked out of the theater while watching BODYGUARD.The film is directed by the same director, for the third time in a different language. Now who would have done it to satisfy his creative urge? Clearly this was a project undertaken for money and money alone, otherwise what is the charm of directing the same script for the third time? As a real creatively concerned person, the director should have given the project to another talented upcoming director and he could have been the Creative Visualiser of the project to keep an overall look on it.But coming to the main point of my distress, there is a scene in the film, where people are standing around a pyre on which the dead body is lying covered in white. To be precise, this is a sequence in which they all have gathered to burn one of the main villains of the film, killed by Salman. Now, to my shocking surprise, the scene has been shot by the talented director in HEAVY RAINS. The water is pouring heavily from the sky, the pile of wood is all wet, the body is all wet and here come a person holding a burning mashaal to set the pyre on fire. And as filmy it can get, he also successfully puts the pyre on fire and then we are shown the body burning calmly just in the middle of a heavy rainfall.If this is what you call direction then Sorry, I am not interested in writing about this film anymore. For me its just like playing with the innocent loyalty of your millions of fans. And all the BIG STARS like SALMAN really need to give it a serious thought."
tt1729637,"After Dabbang and Ready, this film is going to be third consecutive feather in Salman's cap.I felt a little disappointed with the treatment of the movie. The screenplay rushed at an odd pace. The first half was intriguing and speedy, but the second half stammers a bit. Again, in the last 20 minutes, we see a hurricane of emotions.The movie has all the proportionate elements of a Masala Movie, but I seriously felt a letdown in the humor quotient of the movie. The so- called ""Tsunami Singh"" was a high disappointment, rather than him, his T Shirts looked funny. The dialogues were above average.A die-hard Salman fan might get disappointed, but it was a pleasure seeing Salman in a romantic movie; that too; was totally unexpected. Music boosted the movie, due to which, the faulty screenplay gets sidelined.Salman Khan is in top notch here. Kareena is back in the form. Mahesh Manjrekar, Aditya Pancholi, Raj Babbar are remarkable. Rajat Rawail as Tsunami is a letdown. He acts well sans comic timing.Editing by Sanjay Sankla is good, he manages to keep the movie on track in spite of futile screenplay. Cinematography by Sejal Shah is marvelous. Himesh Reshammiya has lived up to the expectations from the fans. Background score from Sandeep Shirodkar is top class.After watching this one, my recent favorites from Salman goes in the following order. 1. Dabbang 2. Bodyguard 3. Wanted 4. ReadyFinally, watch it! Even if you are not a Salman Khan fan, you wont regret watching this one."
tt1729637,Body guard is undoubtedly *the worst* movie of all time (including Tollywood Hollywood and any other wood u can think of) .. this is one movie which deserves a negative rating ! I wish people wouldn't be thins kind with ratings.. This movie doesn't even come close to being rational . A person with the tiniest of logic would want to pour acid in his eyes to relieve himself of the pain he just endured ... the movie has the random-est of beings and *the most terrible* ending of all time ! If i could i would go slap all those producers and action directors that directed this piece of cauliflower yes this movie is that bad ! The toy helicopters and flying actors just add to the misery of the rational audience . To sum it all I wouldn't watch this movie again even if i were paid a 1000 bucks for it !
tt1729637,"From the last 2 years Salman Khan, the 'jaaneman' of mass-pullers has been giving blockbuster hits like Wanted(2009), Dabangg(2010) and that has not been a failure a single time. Wanted, Dabangg, Bbuddah, Singham - Bollywood has got into form of welcoming spectacular action flicks, so Bodyguard is nothing new for it but a Salman touch. But Bodyguard is not a Action flick like the above ones. It's main stream carries Romance but we can see a situation also where action is necessary, just like Ready. Like Ready, this one is also an adaption of south hit 'Bodyguard'. But the question arrives is Bodyguard better or Ready? Ready was a comic-con movie where there was no serious matter, but Bodyguard doesn't lack of that at all. Bbuddah, even being a spectacular film stood a 'so-so' in the box-office, Singham disappointed very much in both fields, so can Bodyguard be the most successful Action movie of this year? The Answer's 'Yes'.When it comes to being punctual and doing his duties perfectly, Lovely Singh is unmatchable. Taking great pride in what he does, he spares no effort in giving his everything to his profession.Summoned for an assignment of guarding Divya, the daughter of Sartaj Rana, a business tycoon. Lovely Singh accompanies her to her campus, but ends up rubbing her the wrong way with his over-protective nature ...and paranoia about security. She finds him to be a major obstacle in leading a regular campus life. To throw him off-track and get him out of the way, she comes up with a 'master-plan'- that of trapping him in a fake love affair. 'Once he's smitten by the girl of his dreams and is reveling in his new-found romance, he will leave us alone, and we shall be free to do our own thing unhindered', says Divya to her friends.She becomes an anonymous admirer of his and starts hounding him, expressing her 'feelings' in no uncertain terms. Lovely Singh however proves to be a tough nut to crack, and it takes quite a bit of doing from her side to penetrate his fort-like exterior. But once she succeeds in doing so, he transforms into a completely different person. Divya is triumphant and is all set to relish her regained freedom.But things take an unexpected turn when she learns a few things about Lovely Singh. Things that she could've never even imagined! And she soon finds herself trapped in a dilemma that she's unable to resolve! And with her, soon enough, Lovely Singh finds himself ensnared in a web of lies, trickery and deceit! On the whole, Bodyguard is a successful tale of Love, Faith & Betrayal. Even the film is not an action movie fully, the action scenes are sure to rain whistles and claps and shouts. When you see Salman's entry with the title track, be sure that there will be no mercy for applause throughout the hall.Siddique's simple but effective story and screenplay has every essential present in it that can bring a rock-hard mood in the hero. Lovely Singh is the symbol of silence, toughness and roughness and the script helps enough to glorify it. The twist-in-the-tale in the climax, which is one of the most surprising ones appeared in recent times was a stunner that makes you forget everything but to concentrate on the movie. How Sallu was tricked by nearly every man he trusted even the person he was protecting throughout, Kareena's sudden change in emotion, the unique storyline and some few but awesomely stylish action sequences and moves makes Bodyguard a dream debut for any director. Just like Abhinav Singh Kashyap, Siddique just got himself a master-blaster at his first try.The first half of the movie was just going by the story to come to the main plot but the second half was furious in parts and it totally abolished the flaws of the first part. The second part works in a respective manner and transcends conceptually to an unbelievable climax. There are some comic moments by Rajat Rawail & some tough moments by the hero himself which are joy to watch.Music of this movie is a bit disappointing. The title track is perfect, no doubt. But other tracks are not so special. 'Teri Meri' is beautifully visualized and it can be a good pick.This one should be counted in one of the best performances by Salman Khan. The always 'no-bakwaas', silent, sweet & tough in times Lovely Singh showed some guts and attitudes which are like the very first time in Bollywood. Lovely Singh overlaps Radhe & Chulpul Pandey this time. Bloody Good! Kareena Kapoor was pretty and stole some actually good moments. As this movie is mainly man-centric, Kareena's character can look a bit unimportant but as she's a good performer, she tried to not let us feel she was unimportant at all. Mahesh Manjrekar was disappointing. Aditya Pancholi in a cameo having a fistfight with Lovely was commendable. Rajat Rawail gives some laughs. Raj Babbar had nothing much to do. Others like Hazel(extremely beautiful girl), Asrani, Mohan Kapoor etc. were okay.Vijayan's action will yet again steal the awards this year, only if Ra. One & Don 2 doesn't compete such well. BGM by Sandeep Shirodhkar were perfectly situational. Art direction by Shailesh Mahadik & Monica Angelica Bhowmick doesn't catch eye. Editing by Sanjay Sankla is appropriate.Sallu's his intentions directly indicated that Bodyguard will shake the box-office for a big time and I'm sure he will pass with flying colors. Bodyguard is a must-watch for the die-hard Salman fans and those who are entertaining movie lovers, this one's a certain dish that they would lick fingers after finishing. Final verdict 'Khud Pe Ek Ehsaan Karna Ke Bodyguard Ko Miss Nahi Karna'."
tt1729637,"If ever there was a film which was a shining example presenting how a director ""drops the ball"" once he smells big money and a way out of the congestion and claustrophobia of regional cinema, all made possible because a star with a humongous fan following took an interest in his screenplay, one need not look any further than Bodyguard. In his review of Ready, Raja Sen wrote, 'In this latest film, Khan seems to be pushing his own rather frightening envelope -- ""How little can I get away with?"" ""Will they pay to just watch me smirk?"" ""Can I do this scene campy and that scene straight?"" ""Will the audience eat up random groin thrusts if only I use the hilarious word 'peoples' over and over again?""' But maybe Sen should have reserved these lines for a far more deserving thing which was to be served only a few months later.At least in Ready, Salman was in his element. His sole strength as an actor and a performer lies in playing smug, self-assured, overconfident macho men with a knowing wink to the audience. Dramatic acting has never been his forte and never will be, since his overall attitude towards his profession and even personal life has always drifted towards imperturbable laziness. Unfortunately, Bodyguard requires the male lead to emote. It asks of him to play a simple-minded loverboy who goes through near-heartbreak at least twice and also a mature man in the last third who is now father and sole guardian to a child. What was going to happen?By virtue of being a near-remake, Bodyguard inherits all the demerits of Kaavalan. And by letting go of all artistic ambition and control, Siddique lays a load of as many shortcomings on top of it. The combined effect is nothing short of monstrously brain-numbing. In Kaavalan, to his credit, Siddique created a believable set of character relationships and obtained fine performances out of all actors. In Bodyguard everything seems to be on autopilot. Here is an intro song number for the hero, there are couple of action scenes which present the hero to be almost God-like, add a fat guy who is expected to make audience laugh simply by the benefit of being what he is, make the heroine's reason for falling for the hero even more illogical then the original, and completely edit out the relationship between heroine and her best friend. The stunt work is inane, the dialogues are lame, the graphics are astoundingly shoddy for a big-budget 2011 Hindi film. In fact the whole mess reeks of hasty filming and haphazard post-production. I remember that prior to the release there were concerns in the industry circles about the lack of publicity and a lot of work on the final product still remaining till the eleventh hour. Of course, now it has all been forgotten due to obvious reasons.How this became such a monstrous hit is unbelievable. But what's happened has happened and nothing can be done about it now. We just have to ensure now that this film is forgotten from the minds of viewers and also discourage potential viewers from viewing this and running the risk of damaging their sanity."
tt1729637,"This movie which i have seen so far might be the best movie of the year as i have not seen that much movies barring NOKJ,Aarakshan.I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.Initially when i saw all the promos of this movie i thought it might be an action film but it turned out to be more of a romanctic movie.I liked the story it seemed it very different at least towards the end from the usual love storys and thats a good thing.Even the comedy in this movie was very nice too.The music is very nice with the best ones being Teri Meri and I love you.The direction was very good too and the scenes were well executed.The acting was top notch.Salman gave a brilliant performance throughout the movie and in my opinion deserves the best actor award and i really believe that given a chance and also a good director he really can give more great performances like this one.Kareena has given a blazing powerhouse performance as Divya she has a very meaty role and despite Salman having the author backed role i think she really outshined him in a couple of scenes and i also thought she was very cute when she was acting as Chaaya .And the actress who plays Maya was also amazing inspite her role was a supporting one and i think she should win a lot of awards for this one.The little kid who played Salman son was quite convincing especially in the scene where he asks Kareena to be his mother.The action and stunt scenes were magnificent but got boring after a while.I also thought after the Desi Beats song in the second half i thought the movie had started to became more intense and interesting.Anyhow this movie definitely deserves to be watched."
tt1729637,"Is this movie good: Yes .....is it very good: NO....is it on same same level as Dabangg: NO....is it better than Ready: YES...!!!This movie is very simple, it doesn't have any big plots or thinking material, just a plain and simple movie. Its definitely not one of Salman Khans's best movie. So what save the movie? it must be The big hype around Salman Khan and the Songs.I personally don't see Bollywood doing any improvement, they are now stealing stories and songs from South Indian movies and as we all know very few of these movies are good. Bodyguard is worth a watch, and much better than the Non-Brainer ""Ready"", but its not one of Salman Khan's best.The Song ""Teri Meri"" is breath taking, beautiful song."
tt1729637,"all hopes end in vain.The movie is entertaining in patches that too only in first half of the movie.second half is disastrous.no any strong plot,emotions too not up to the mark.movie just seems like the mix of 2-3 movies in particular.The only saving grace of the movie was khan'sacting.khan is good,Kareena is average.even villains only looks like dangerous but they r never threat to our hunk.new comer Hazel Croney was good looking.Songs of the movie was very good.in short bodyguard is not even capable of guarding his own movie at the box office.It seems like that khan is badly obsessed with Telugu movie.he should look forward to act in better movies.not every movie is DABANGG,we know that.Go for the movie if Ur a hardcore khan fan."
tt1729637,"Salman Khan is playing the role of a bodyguard, in this humorless movie with stupid action scenes. He gets introduced to be a hard stone man who lets his opponents pee in their pants. How, dancing? This guy can't dance. He is no Hritik Roshan. He still is this stiff man who cannot dance and who cannot act in a mature way in the first half.The movie is filled with stupid rhyme jokes that are not funny. Like: waiter I see you later."" Who wrote these lines? They are very dated. This bodyguard is wearing an earphone, why? He isn't communicating to anyone. He wears sunglasses inside, why? Salman Khan is driving in a bus to go to Kareena Kapoor. I thought this man who was running towards the bus, calling ""tupperware"" was Govinda. It amazes me how Bollywood can present Kareena Kapoor as a beautiful woman, when she isn't. She can act though. I was pleased to see Raj Babbar back in a movie. This man has a beautiful voice. The action sequences are not real. Salman beats a lot of guys up one by one in the disco, but after he beats up each guy, they disappear. Now it's not OK that a man from in the almost fifties falls in love with a girl who is in college or vice versa.I don't want to be all negative about this movie, so I mention one major plus: Aditya Pancholi! He's a great actor. And leaving all the jokes about Salman Khan aside, SK can play emotional and physical complicated roles very well. That's why it's a pity and a waste that he plays comedy movies and dances in songs. He should do what he's best at. He proved that in the scene where he said ""I love you"" to Kareena and thought he was speaking to Chaiya. Very beautiful moment, but he had to spoil it by bumping to the tree. The part of the bodyguard did not suit him, the part of this insecure man did. And that's very interesting. There is more about Salman Khan than meets the eye. Just face it and show it to us.After this park scene the movie gets mature and all together interesting. That's also the right environment for Aditya Pancholi to perform at best. What bothers me is that the similar action-scenes in old movies like Mission Kashmir or Blind Fury is much better than in this movie. And that's not good. Salman Khan already showed us he can act on a mature level in Tere Naam. If he would play in a movie without the stupid jokes, good action is not necessary, good story, mature acting, he could really amaze us, because Salman Khan is a complex actor who is not all around in acting. That sets a limit on his skills. But when he knows what his limits are and gets the best out of that, he could amaze more people than only a few he has reached so far. Don't travel the same road as JcVD, but learn from other's mistakes. As for JCvD, I really think he's making his comeback."
tt1729637,"The 'Try to be' remake of Dabangg but its all waste and crappy. One body guard trying to protect our heroine from the villain but there is one thing missing, the Story. There is no story in this film and to make some money out of it main attractions has been all the cast list. I would advice Salman Khan to stop experimenting because Dabangg was one family venture which went all excellently right but this piece of crap is down the drain. No doubt the action is good but acting is very poor and also the story line Two Hollywood movie stories cannot make one Hindi movie. Telegu action sequences OK acceptable. Salman's acting have also deteriorated in this movie other than Dabang. I give only 3 out of 5 to Salmans action and total movie acting rest of the cast sorry to say, made a mess."
tt1729637,"Although Indians are not good at action movies, they're really good at romance. This film is a mixture of both of them. Some scenes were not logical, for example when Lovely got private number calls again and again he chould have prevented it. Instead, he kept talking on the phone with that unknown person. Another illogical thing was that how he could fall in love with a person whose face he has never seen. Apart from these, the film is amusing and the music is so touching. It made me cry. Salman Khan is such a good actor. And so is Kareena Kapoor. To sum up, the film is worth watching though there are some illogical parts because it's a romance and Bollywood is really good at romance."
tt1729637,"The Rockstar has scored a hat-trick with his third consecutive Eid release with the first two films being 'Wanted' and 'Dabangg'.The film portrays Salman as a bodyguard who looks robust but is tender and romantic at heart. Produced by his brother-in-law Atul Agnihotri and sister Alvira, 'Bodyguard' has all the essential elements of a blockbuster film.Kudos to filmmaker Siddique to have presented Salman Khan in a way never seen before! And the action sequences are breathtaking. Incorporating the tried and tested formula of romance cum action, director Siddique has been able to churn out a thriller that keeps you glued to your seat until the very end. Coming to the movie~ Salman Khan Has Developed An Art of Delivering a Performance exactly d way audiences expect from him..first of all dis movie isn't out an out action flick..Its an Emotional Love story with a tinge of Action and Comedy.Surprisingly Kareena Kapoor's role is equally meatier(Rare sight in a Salman Khan film).she has delivered a very gud performance..Salman's Character will make u laugh and also cry.Another Blockbuster For Salman ,Second half will blow you with the eternal emotional touch .. some may make you cry also ..First Half Is Good it prepares a plot for second even then it keeps you entertaining , But Second Half Was Amazing Will Keep U Guessing Whats Going To Happen Next U Have No Clue Until It Ends...Mark My Words Pre-Climax Will Surely Shock U...Best Love Story In Recent Times :)*The title track and 'Teri Meri...' are sure to rock the audience."
tt1729637,"If you are looking for a realistic storyline or movie with good dialogues, I will not recommend this movie. But if you want to see Salman Khan with an old classical Bollywood story, It might be a good choice for you. Some scenes are mood booster.Also, it is a bit mixture of comedy with action. So not a wrong choice if you are unhappy and looking for a mood booster movie. I felt refreshed with a good smile after watching this."
tt1729637,"Before release I had massive expectations from this movie considering it had salman khan who is in golden form, top actress kareena kapoor and hit music ! Bodyguard was huge letdown - as nothing is good in this movie except music ! Performances - Salman Khan is not up to mark in this movie. He was average. Hope he does better in next movie. Kareena Kapoor was okay. Villains were funny than scaring. Rest provide average support except Rajat Rawail who was horrible.Story, Direction all were pedestrian. Music was highlight of movie.Especially Teri Meri And I Love You song.Salman is having great run but such movie will hamper his golden run as audiences today are unforgiving if u gave them bad products. Wish best for him in Ek Tha Tiger and Sharekhan and he will come back to form again.In Other Words, Bodyguard is huge disappointment 3/10"
tt1729637,"the movie has no story, sorry ass comedy, just some ass kicking, totally not worth watching full of crap movie.Salman's acting sucked as well as Kareena's.even the bullshit story was stolen from south Indian movie.i think Salman want to be the Rajnikant of Bollywood.its as bad as ready,empty plot,no acting,no special direction,crappy script with disturbing songs i don't how did it went blockbuster hit. this is not film making,this is movie is just a humiliation for Bollywoodnot worth watching waste of money and time if you love Salman and want to watch this movie just to show your support,then you should be ashamed of your self. go watch ""that girl in yellow boots"" if you want to see a good film. to conclude bodyguard is just bullshit"
tt0102166,This is Joker seemingly it is the swedish orginal which the joker reboot from 2019 have taken inspiration from. This is one of the best and well executed films in all time and of course they have Björn skifs in the role as Nicke the version of Joker in this universe. This is basically Joker hunted by the italian mafia while fighting nazis
tt2828996,"If you like the first ""A Haunted House"" movie, then you will also like this one, because it is initially the same kind of spoofy comedy in a genre that just won't die.The comedy is fast paced and right up to par with the comedy seen in the first movie. And Marlon Wayans do pull it off nicely enough. While this is a comedy, it is not the kind that will have you bursting out in laughter while tears trickle down your cheeks. I think I only laughed once actually. But that being said, the movie isn't bad, nor is it boring. The comedy is good and serves the movie right. The comedy here is the type that will brighten up your mood and put a smile on your face.Similar to the first movie, an entity is haunting Malcolm and making his life a living hell, especially when no one believes him as things escalate out of control.I enjoy these spoof movies and always have, and this one is one of the better ones, especially because it is making fun of the ghost and horror genres of movies.Like the first movie, I am rating ""A Haunted House 2"" a 6 out of 10 stars."
tt2828996,"This is such a misunderstood film. I found it to be really funny. I can see why a lot of people do not get the humor in this film but for the people that does you will find a lot of laughs... especially Marlon's solo work with just the doll in the scenes... for example the argument that he gets into with the doll is really funny because it is so real... it is the exact same argument and the same stages of an argument that most men and women have been through. I do not understand how so many people call this film unwatchable... I know that my sense of humor is dark and I find a lot of things funny that your average person does not but I love scary movie 1 and 2 , love films like superbad or spaceballs... and I can see that this film isnt a classic like those but it still has some very funny material and I respect Marlon as a comedian more and more with every film of his I see."
tt2828996,"The movie is the sequel of the last year's well known horror film parody by Marlon Wayans. It could have been guessed easily, because if we were talking about scary movies"", than the name of the Wayans brothers come into everybody's mind immediately. For me they form a duo, only whose face is enough to being seen on a movie poster to get myself excited about the actual production. It was also the same situation with this movie, but the final result has ended up with a medley packed with hard mix of emotions.Marlnon Wayans is still hilarious for me, and I think it will never change. Overall I consider the movie a really good entertainment, however the notorious comic actor has some really weird moments when he successfully managed to not poorly exaggerate and overdo his role. Sometimes when something was humorous at the beginning turned out to be a vigorous effort by the end, which is often delayed in time. So it felt to me sometimes, that it's primary purpose was to lengthen the runtime of the movie. So occasionally we can laugh on some scenes at the beginning, but after a short time that smile starts to get faded away, even though the scene continues which was intended to be funny.The casting crew has changed a little bit. For example Wayans has an other girlfriend who is just as annoying on the big screen (and untalented) than the previous one. However, she's a perfect choice for an aesthetic element (most likely it was the goal of her role). The children do not appear on the screen so often, which made me really happy initially, because personally speaking I'm not really keen for the young actors. Buti n this movie, when the young boy was just about showing up for a minute and saying a short monologue, a loud laughter erupted from me. I really rarely say that to a child actor, but I think he did a remarkable job!In addition, the range of characters extended with a Mexican-style amigo (who plays Wayans neighbor by the way). He's become my favorite after his first appearance on the screen. I was infatuated with listening to his non-sense spiels, and I've just loved him creating more and more amusing sentences within fractions of a second.Otherwise the funny scenes of the movie were very similar to what we could experience in its predecessor, so if you liked the first one you'd probably like this one about the same. I think they overdid the sex-related gags a little bit. 2 or 3 are even funny, the 5th is not so, but after the tenth the production is about getting really dull and monotonous. However, the film is not too long, so it doesn't leave us enough time to get bored.Overall, the movie is not worthy for the standard created by the classic Scary Movie"", but I consider it a perfect evening entertainment, if you simply wanna have fun.Rating 5/10Thanks for spending your precious free time with reading my review! Hope you liked it!"
tt2828996,"A Haunted House 2 is an American 'comedy' 'horror' film directed by Michael Tiddes and starring Marlon Wayans. The film is the sequel to the 2013 film A Haunted House. Having exorcised the demons of his ex, Malcolm is beginning fresh with his new partner and her two children. After moving into their dream home, however, Malcolm (Marlon Wayans) is once again plagued by strange supernatural events. From the opening sequence, right up until the closing credits, the film is a complete calamity. The film's screenplay is aimless, stupid and staggeringly unfunny – not a single gag throughout the entire film resonates with audiences. This, taken in combination with pointlessly constructed racist stereotypes and unbelievably dull horror clichés, means that sitting through the films short runtime of eighty six minutes becomes almost impossible. Wayans's performance is excruciatingly painful to watch. Malcolm is an astoundingly unlikable lead protagonist – and in all the wrong ways. On no occasion do his bizarre actions and ear-splitting shrieking ever seem necessary, and his lack of any sort of morality or even awareness of the reality that surrounds him results audiences hastily attempting to distance themselves as much as possible from a character that presumably is meant to be engaging and amusing. The film manages to surpass the stale mediocrity of its predecessor. It's a tortuous waste of time which could have been better spent doing almost anything else. The film's only asset is that it's almost instantly forgettable. As the credits roll, the sensation of a deep exhale of breath and thinking, ""I never have to watch A Haunted House 2 again"", is certainly something to savour. The film is an unmistakable catastrophe."
tt2828996,"I have not seen the first ""A Haunted House"" film, but after sitting through this dreadful sequel I don't think I would like to. Why this trashy unpleasant film was released on Easter weekend is beyond me.There is no coherent story. Upon getting over an ex-girlfriend who got possessed by evil spirits, Malcolm hooks up and moves in with a new girl Megan and her two kids. What follows is an embarrassing mishmash of scenes from recent big hits in the horror genre, ""Sinister"", ""Insidious"" and ""The Conjuring,"" as Malcolm continues to be terrorized by demonic events. Marlon Wayans plays Malcolm in the most irritating and annoying manner, with his non-stop loud screaming and nonsensical ranting. He has a prolonged, uncomfortable and unfunny sex sequence where Marlon gets it on with a doll that looks like the diabolical Annabelle from ""The Conjuring"". More awful jokes of such sick sexual nature would recur through the rest of the film.You go into a spoof film like this to have a shallow laugh out of jokes inspired by your favorite horror films. However, within the first few minutes, you already get the feeling that this film will not entertain you at all. In fact, it could even be quite boring, with very long humorless scenes that overstay their welcome. There are many scenes which would offend pet lovers, Catholics, Mexicans, women, and practically everyone else. I found it interesting only when it tries to recreate a recognizable scene from those modern horror classics, like the group hanging from ""Sinister"" or the ""Hide and Clap"" game from ""The Conjuring"". But unfortunately, I wind up disappointed because its spoofing just falls terribly flat. I would have had a good time if a film was dumb and funny, but this film is just plain dumb, not funny. 1/10."
tt2828996,"I didn't want to give 7/10, but 6/10. The main reason is because most people didn't quite appreciate this movie. This is just another form of comedy (such as ""meet the spartans"") which ""most"" people don't want to understand. The kind of movie where you spoil everything, really everything and it turns out to be really hilarious!You can't go to the cinema and watch this film and expect nice little laughs like other typical Hollywood comedies. This is totally different.Compared to the previous episode, well many similar sequences. Won't place spoilers, but quite repeating. Still very funny.The main actor did a wonderful job at making this movie really funny.The cast consists of more or less same people from the 1st episode. Contains plenty of swearing, racial words, very direct interracial swearing, some nudity, violence.Mixed up parody of several movies together, all bundles into having a good time laughing. Never had such a laugh with typical Hollywood comedy.If you didn't laugh at the beginning of this movie, well, don't continue, you won't like it. But if you had a laugh, then just don't blink :DCheers, an absolute must-watch when u want some good laughs."
tt2828996,Avoid this film have just watched it and it had to be the worst movie i have ever seen and has no storyline or creativity to it at all to make it worse they made it look like a porno movie so if u have any children do not let them see this movie utter garbage nothing will ever surpass the Scary movie trilogy the reason i don't say series is that the last 2 have also been garbage (Scary Movie 4-5) so avoid this movie at all costs!!!!! If you however have seen this movie i hope you ask for a refund or entrance to a better film i can only hope that the film creators go back to the drawing board and look at classic comedy like the naked gun trilogy and get some tips from their creators as the people who made this film have been drinking or taking drugs during the making of the so called film AVOIDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!
tt2828996,Typical wayans spoof movie... best to watch with some alc..... but always enjoyable
tt2828996,"Really good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.I'll easily watch anything with Jaime Lee Pressly in it, but Marlon Wayans is kind of the big treat in this. One of the reasons I liked the first movie is that they got back to the spirit of the original ""Scary Movie"" franchise before they took it from the Wayans.There are a few jokes that just run too long, but over all the jokes are pretty funny and consistent, even doing call backs.The movie rolls together several different paranormal tropes very well, and given some very short re-writes could have been a rather complex legitimate horror movie."
tt2828996,"I've liked Marlon Wayans work in the past. I actually think ""Little Man"" is a funny comedy. I didn't think that this movie could be that bad, since I know Wayans can do good jokes. But, this was a huge mistake. I regret watching this. It's just people screaming and trying to be racy or chocking. It left me speechless, in a bad way that is. I couldn't believe that Wayans got a studio to give him the budget and that it was released in theaters. The chicken fight scene was the only part that made me chuckle. And I wanted to see something funny. I don't even wanna bother talking about what other stuff happens here. It's just a waste of talent and time. And trust me, you don't even wanna know what happens in this movie.So, stay away at all cost. Marlon Wayans, I know you can be funny. Please don't you ever make ""A Haunted House 3"" (only if you can actually make it good). I'm telling you; don't watch this movie, you'll waste your time."
tt2828996,"I knew going into it that it would be somewhat crude, but hoped it would be funny. There were a couple of chuckles in the beginning, but about 15 mins into it there was a scene with Damon Wayans having sex with a doll and went on and on and was disgusting. Not even funny. Just strange, sick and pornish. Walked out and got my money back. I'm tired of paying for trash and then just sitting through it hoping it gets better. Don't waste your money.I actually enjoyed the trailers that play before the actual movie. Laughed really hard at a preview of movie coming soon called ""A Million Ways to Die in the West."""
tt2828996,"I recalled my experience of the original Haunted House film at the beginning of the year by saying in my review, ""When I sit through an eighty-one minute parody, given nothing but extended fart gags, annoying characters, ridiculously crass sex scenes, and a minute and a half sequence of a grown man having sex with a teddy bear, I don't laugh, I wince and later recall the experience sourly."" Despite most of my review of the original film applying to the film's sequel, A Haunted House 2, I specifically cherrypicked this quote because it was a list of the glaring annoyances in the original film. However, I don't have to do much modifying to that sentence to describe the miscalculation that is A Haunted House 2 except in this film, a grown men has sex with a cursed doll rather than a teddy bear. Indeed, we must endure a horribly long, crass, and desperately unfunny scene of Marlon Wayans having explicit and lewd sex with a doll before his wife comes in. At first, it seemed like a horribly desperate way to achieve laughs; now it seems like a pleasurable act for Wayans to engage in one of his presumed fetishes. Have mercy.A Haunted House 2 compliments its predecessor in that it's a moronic assembly of ridiculous scenarios, unfunny parodies, and lazily-written scenes, strung together in a style that resembles a collection of vignettes rather than a real film. We're reunited with Malcolm Johnson (Marlon Wayans), who attempts to move on from his old girlfriend Kisha and move in with his new girlfriend Megan (Jaime Pressly) and their two kids. Megan's teenage daughter winds up discovering a box in the basement of their new home, which she proceeds to carry around and coddle obsessively, while Megan's younger son exercises his imagination with an imaginary friend, who turns out to be vulgar and abusive. Malcolm also discovers a doll, which spoofs the Annabelle doll from The Conjuring, which seems to hold cursed powers and clings to a strange, sexual relationship after Malcolm winds up having sex with it one night. The film basically follows the blueprint of its predecessor, which is just to be just as repetitive as the Paranormal Activity films we've been greeted with this year in a haphazardly-handled manner.The irony of A Haunted House and its sequel is that if Marlon and company wanted to prove they were funnier or somewhat superior (which is kind of what the idea of a parody film is, poking fun at the clichés in a manner that provides the illusion of a higher-power of wit and creativity) that they'd create a film that was more bent on satire rather than catering to the lowest common denominator of American audiences. Similar to Grown Ups 2, no matter how hard you try, the film seems to have a lower impression of you than you have of it, and provides eighty-two minutes of some of the most contrived, predictable entertainment we've seen all year.A reminder to readers not wholly familiar to my work - I enjoy the raunchiest of comedies, the lewdest of scenarios, and frequently regard films bearing foul language and nudity as enticing works of modern comedic art. However, A Haunted House 2 demonstrates nothing more than forced humor and crassness taken to the level of pure laziness and monotony. Despite all efforts to infuse jokes and references into the film's structure, writers Wayans and Rick Alvarez, along with director Michael Tiddes, make the crucial and crippling mistake of acknowledging the franchise or name they want to parody and assume we should laugh based on recognition, which is a fatal misstep for this genre of films, pioneered by the equally-lazy and contemptible likes of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (the men behind the ""Movie"" franchise of parody movies, like Date Movie and Epic Movie).The only true reason to endure the dreadfully unfunny spectacle of tastelessness that is A Haunted House 2 is to see the comedic energy of Wayans himself who, while making a very bad film, still manages to be spirited and zippy about the whole affair, along with Gabriel Iglesias, whose brief scenes in the film provide for some necessary comic relief. Even if such scenes are predicated off of tiresome stereotypes and misrepresented exchanges of racism, at least it beats overlong scenes of filthy, unnecessary sex inside a film that's already nearly unwatchable without them.Starring: Marlon Wayans, Jaime Pressly, Gabriel Iglesias, Affion Crockett, Essence Atkins, and Cedric the Entertainer. Directed by: Michael Tiddes."
tt2828996,"""Prepare to meet your maker. I'm sending you back to Taiwan!"" After finally getting rid of his possessed ex, Malcolm (Wayans) has started a new life in a new house with his new girl Megan (Pressly). When the same thing starts happening again he thinks it has to do with a creepy doll. Once again Malcolm has to exercise something out of his life. So I will say that I thought the first one was funny for about 20 minutes then started to get old. Most spoof movies are like that though so I won't hold it against them. I in no way thought this needed a sequel. After about five minutes I was certain that they didn't need a sequel. While the first one kept me laughing for about half the time I don't think I even smiled at all watching this one. It may be that the humor just wasn't for me but some of the jokes went on way to long and they weren't funny to start with (the sex scene with the doll for example). It had the right idea mixing Sinister and The Conjuring for the main story line but they didn't do anything with it. Overall, a movie that started off annoying and never really got better, I really struggled to get through this one. I give it a D."
tt2828996,"i wasn't going to watch due to all the negative comments then thought if i went by all the comments I've read id have probably only ever gotten to watch 2 movies in my life. so watched it and had a darn good laugh. if you have a sense of humor and didn't laugh, lighten up, bottle of wine, relax and watch again. not every movie is going to be a blockbuster. I've read some long winded reviews on here about some movies...like your the only ""film critic"" on the planet and you must get your point across to the dumb asses who might be about to watch it. we are all individuals,different tastes,so if you didn't like a movie for any reason say so in 3 words instead of trying to turn the whole world against it"
tt2828996,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I don't even know why I decided to watch it at the first place if its not because my friends were curious about it. Some of them have seen the first one before, so they expected this one should be somewhere as good. But nope. I literally sat there with my phone and 2048 for the entire 90 minutes block and bored to death. Most of the jokes are lame and cheap. I was really trying to laugh, but too bad I gave up after 15 minutes. My friends and I left and we were all like ""this is so retarded"". If you're interested in watching naked black guy having sex with a haunted doll, then you might want to give this a try. If not, please save your time and money. Go watch some better movie."
tt2828996,"NO SPOILING, just what you can read at the Sinopsis!!! There's no words to describe this kind of terrible and hateful movies, but really, I don't know what to say, it's incredibly bad and stupid, the only little thing is that, I laughed for 2m. on it's beginning.The whole movie is dedicated to show us the insatiable desire for sex of the protagonist and his incoherent daily routine noting that a ghost follows him as it happened in the 1st movie, and the things that happens here, are exactly as the things in the 1st movie, awful and with no sense Pd: I really don't know what to say, It's terrible! ""We're going to need to get a priest to perform a real exorcism!"""
tt2828996,Pretty funny with some memorable and hysterical parts (2 viewings)
tt2828996,"I just saw this movie on Netflix. What a waste of time I did not enjoy this movie at all.This movie was a sequel to the first Haunted House movie that I actually enjoyed. This movie was not even funny I had to even pretend to laugh at certain moments of this film. Because I have heard these jokes so many times most of the jokes in this film were very cliché. I heard these types of jokes countless amounts of times. I found it very hard to laugh throughout this movie. This movie made jokes about many different groups of people like African Americans, Hispanics, Catholics and more. Jokes that I have heard a multiple amount of times. This movie was supposed to be a spoof to the paranormal activity films just like the first haunted house but this is the first sequel I here they could possibly be making another sequel. Hopefully it will be better than A Haunted House 2."
tt2828996,I didn't even watch it as soon as the scene starts with the doll I turned it off! How is that funny ? I'm sorry the doll looked like a child what the hell were they thinking ?
tt2150139,"Poor acting and canned plot aside, this movie was the non toxic good fun it needed to be for an enjoyable movie night with my 8 year old. Recommended if you're looking for an easy watch with your kid and they love gymnastics. It's a simple predictable story about a girl with a lot of potential gaining the confidence to beat the odds. Maddy is a rising star gymnast but jealous teammates succeed at feeding her self doubts when they start believing she may be real competition. With the help of her upstart new coach, Maddie begins to set her sights on winning the upcoming national competition. It's not ruining anything to say she eventually gets there because it's what the movie is so clearly about. I could come up with a thousand reasons why I would never want to watch it again but seeing my daughter yelp with excitement and joy in all the right places made it all worth it."
tt2150139,"Movie was selected by a patient on an ambulance transport. 100% not my choice.Writing was choppy and so disconnected I could barely follow the story. No character development, backstories were minimal or non-existent. Cinematography was poor at best. Framing of shots looked more like it was done by people in elementary school.With as many as they did, this movie should have been named ""Montage"".And the use of the blatant ""Eye of the Tiger"" ripoff was pointless drivel."
tt2150139,"It was a terrible experience. I dont know who edited it, but please take some editing classes."
tt2150139,"I had to sit through this as a nanny, the kids decided to watch it, and I had to supervise. It was awful acting, script, soundtrack. Nothing about it is authentic. Even the kids got bored. It had potential to be an interesting film to inspire kids to be involved in the sport, but instead there was awful scripting, and acting that blundered its way through 90 minutes of pure rubbish. There is nothing of substance and I could go on and on about it. BUT I wont...because then I will end up being just as boring as the film. I felt the tacky lines and on the side romance was not necessary and the kids were not keen on it. It drags on and on, until we get to the big competition where lo and behold the predictability metre goes off the charts."
tt2150139,"This film only reinforces stereotypes of the macho society. Women are weak, men are strong. Women are dumb, men are smart. Women are emotional, men are rational. film. The world is not just about winning. The film also reinforces other stereotypes as the rich are bad and the poor always have to sacrifice to achieve success belong to the world. The performances are poor, the script is poor, edition is poor. It could have been a story about how to overcome the obstacles, limits, etc. But instead it only focuses on the difference between being man or woman. Besides all that, it is no dynamic, is not entertaining and due to the structure of the script it ends up being so predictable. I would not let my children watch this."
tt2150139,"From an adult perspective its pretty poor, but the girls 5, 7 and 8 absolutely loved it and spent the next hour doing gymnastics around the house. The plot is predictable and the acting is average, at best. A good movie when you want to have a cuddle the kids and nap on the couch."
tt2150139,"This movie is a low budget flick without many worthwhile qualities. Everything about the movie is mediocre at best: the script, the acting, the directing, the music, and so on. The adult actors all hover at around run-of-the-mill level. The child actors go from not good to terrible. At times the acting is so cringe-worthily bad that even the most patient of us will think to turn it off. The script is really odd with a slowly-paced storytelling punctuated with unconvincing developments and silly training montages. This all comes to a predictable and ridiculously optimistic ending that not only misses the chance for a non-Hollywood story arc but takes the standard formula and makes it even more of a happy ending than usual in a Hollywood movie. I've seen truly awful movies and this isn't that bad but it's down there."
tt2150139,A aussie movie that isn't Yahoo Serious' unfunny swill or Mad Max. A young girl has a second chance a pre-olympics tournament to qualify for the National Squad. However she is lacking in the pre-requisite physique. She works with her coaches to help her prepare mentally and physically for this trial.As an amature who has never practiced gymnastics before the actress who plays Maddy picked up enough skills. The point is that it's a children's movie designed to convey a tail of resilience. Critics of this movie want her to be level 3 gymnastics for an actress who has never done the sport before.
tt2150139,Very pretentious but some nice messages in the script just so tacky and corny. Completely ripped-off from similar genre films.Direction is ok but the acting is shocking. The adults look like they had a crash-course at Neighbours.Very rich lifestyle film. Very dull. Unbelievable corny script. Not sure how this got a budget. Terrible.
tt2150139,The actors are more monotonous than siri. The kids sound bored. I am bored. Good story garbage actors. I would rather watch this movie dubbed by siri.
tt2150139,"I sat through this with my 5 year old. It was painful. So very, very painful. The 'gymnastics bits' were ok and enough to inspire, but wow the superfluous school playground storylines outside of the gymnastics is so poor; so stereotypical and badly written. The acting in general is also very very poor; even from the adults! Actually, the adults are worse than the kids and harder to watch. Some of the adult characters also behave like kids in a very non-funny way. And who did the editing OMG! I will not encourage my daughter to watch this again, and even if she begs me, I'll be in another room!"
tt2150139,"A Second Chance is such a classic movie for 2000s kids who were home sick. However, the acting isn't that good and the plot is weird. The rivalry over an accident that lasted more than a decade isn't that realistic. Although, this movie is good for that nostalgic gymnastics feels."
tt2150139,"I happened to catch this movie on a Christian TV channel recently. Although there is no overt religious messaging, the movie has a positive, moral story line and is 'clean' (no sex, violence), making it suitable for kids and for adults who are tired of skin, guts, and gore. Some reviewers may consider the movie 'milquetoast', but I considered it a pleasant respite from the worldly messaging too often promoted in TV, music, and movies today. I intend to purchase this as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter who is a gymnast."
tt2150139,If you are expecting a big blockbuster movie than this is not the movie for you. Instead what you will get is a nice little Australian movie. Don't expect much from it and you will be happily rewarded. Granted the story is a little run of the mill and predictable but then again most family movies are so why should this one be any different?The acting is not of the highest standard but it is acceptable enough to watch and accept their performances as a passing grade. As to the gymnastics side of the equation I am not really an expert but while again it wasn't of the highest standard it did seem passable enough for me and didn't really affect the movie in any way.I may be a touch biased as this is one of my daughters favourite films but I have watched it a few times with her now and each time I have found it as enjoyable as the last so I have no problem in recommending it to anyone who may be thinking about giving this film a try.If I have to have any real gripe about the movie is the fact that it had to many side stories going on that never really got much time to develop them fully. They tried to give all the characters backstories but never really gave us a chance to understand much about those stories. It is only a minor gripe which again doesn't really take away much from the movie so take it however you feel.
tt2150139,A little bit 'semplyfied' but nice for an ex gymnast.. I'm a trainer... and I'll propose it to my gymnast 😊
tt10446712,"I saw this title being offered on Netflix so I thought I would give it a go. The only thing which appeared to be remotely interesting about this title was that Kinison briefly mentioned new millennium celebrations, which sadly he never made it to.The picture and sound quality is very amateurish and I think this may well have been intended for a private collection only and not to be released publicly. The tragic death of Kinison shortly afterwards, may well have prompted it to be released as an extra to the material which was available.I haven't really seen much else of Kinison at the time of typing this comment and to be honest I was not impressed by this performance at all! He seems to shout a lot and use the F word like it is going out of fashion. Such behaviour does not constitute good comedy. I got bored after about half an hour and stopped watching it. I wanted to like it, but I really couldn't.The humour standard was quite low, as was the entire presentation. The stage was extremely basic as well as Kinison's attire. These things all make me wonder if the show was not due for a release in its own right and maybe Kinison's premature death prompted it to be released.It is hard to believe that Mr Kinison used to be a religious preacher! I seriously hope his other works are better than this!"
tt4467262,"Inspired by the Hollywood Cult Classic 500 Days of Summer, 'Katti Batti' tries hard to adapt the soul of its inspiration, but what is eventually served is a merely average film. Though the idea is great, the execution is uneven!'Katti Batti' is a romantic comedy that follows Maddy (Imran Khan) and Payal's (Kangana Ranaut) live-in relationship until a sudden turn of events creates a distance between them.'Katti Batti' has a lively first-hour, where some sequences bring a smile on your face. Its a bit interesting to see the heartbroken protagonist struggle to find his love back & the flashbacks on how the boy & girl met, have a niceness to it. Its the second-hour that fails. The narrative loses energy & the pace drops drastically. Also, the emotional manipulation in the final-act, doesn't work. In short, the first-hour works, but the second-hour spoils the fun.Anshul Singhal's Screenplay is decent, but only in parts. The second-hour needed to be better! Nikhil Advani's Direction is ordinary. Cinematography is fine. Editing is average. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is melodious.Performance-Wise: Imran Khan puts up a sincere act as the heartbroken lover-boy, although he impresses only in some scenes. Kangana Ranaut is monotonous. A stereotypical act!On the whole, 'Katti Batti' works in bits, not entirely."
tt4467262,"Love stories often don't work when the people involved in them are ignorant as heck. Katti Batti tries to literally adapt one such story and on the way goes on to define absurdity. Most words and phrases used in this review are selected from the film's idiotic dialogs so that you get a better idea as to what to expect.For most of the part, a peppy, hip girl named Payal (Ranaut) who is a wandering rebel born to Page 3 celebrities who decided to go all the way on the backseat of a car during a drunken brawl, and who has more than 2500 friends on Facebook is brutally skirt-chased by a baby- faced Maddy (Khan) who makes pursuing architecture look like a short week of R&R, who has just about 500 friends on Facebook including 350 fake profiles that he does't know about, and who has an annoying sister. There is no conviction in the story as it adopts a fair non-linear screenplay. An introduction to the so-called quirky characters using a hand-held shot sequence is all there is to relish in the first half.The screenplay looks like it has been stitched together using a defunct sewing machine by a one-legged tailor with retina inflammation. There is humor if you look for it, but the slapstick is so bad my senses now have finally learned to smile at Kapil Sharma's jokes. Love is fine, relationships are fine, even breakups are fine, but you don't want to shell out money to watch grown ups behave like kids, now do you? One should blame the dodgy story for its construction and unbelievability factor for all we see is a mopey boyfriend and a courageous girlfriend who does not like being called a girlfriend. So lets call her a girlfriend just to annoy her.Ranaut is an active participant in the drama while her co-actor is just a bystander. Since you all have given her the license, she overacts a bit too much in the sequences that required silence. All other characters are running behind our male protag so that he can forget about this ""girlfriend"" who dumped him without a reason. And the reason for the breakup is stupid, considering we are in 2015, when you know it.All said and done, the film is surely high on creativity, but is highly low on cake on which this creativity should have been the icing.BOTTOM LINE: With a turtle called Milkha (the irony!), Nikhil Advani's Katti Batti is what you get when you take relationships too seriously and literally and make a film about it. Wait for DVD; but buy only when its price goes down to INR 49 on Amazon. And why not use the Mobikwik cashback offer on it?Grade: D-Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"
tt4467262,"Lame!! Confusing!! Catastrophe!! The most confused director i have ever observed. He has placed himself at the helm of a sinking ship relying on such confusing plot, an unconvincing romance between co-stars.It was a tormenting journey throughout the movie and felt many times that it could have been ended right there. You want plot? Katti Batti is a very bad combination of 500 days of summer, sweet November,Striken and a few i don't remember.You will feel many times puzzled if i am watching the same movie.One of the most lame romantic movie of the year. My advice, if you are expecting a good Rom com movie by watching its trailer then don't go for it. It is boring, slack and stupid at many times. Avoid giving yourself a tormenting 135 minutes experience."
tt4467262,"Only thing I want to appreciate is the promo making team, who juiced up all the good stuff in promo that rest remained tasteless and baseless. Surprisingly first creative film making team must have thought about climax then, hurriedly and illogically started journey to find it's beginning but fails badly in it. There is nothing in name of story except pushed emotional climax, which makes you laugh instead of cry. Yes, if they have come up with good scenes then this climax could have been worked a bit but alias what could they have done with black comedy expert main male lead, which can evoke laughter in any emotional scene as it is cake walk for him. Screenplay succeeds completely to create confusing characters, irritating comedy and non relating emotional scenes. Script tries hard to give you the feeling that lead couple should be together but after few minutes you pray that they shouldn't. What is the irony of script!! Film starts with some amateur shooting video but it is most amateurish and long that you get the first bitter taste of remaining dish in few minutes only. How they break characters, in a scene they show a businessman is of tainted character but what was the need of showing him! Yes, he was the father of opponent but then why! Just because you felt the way of showing it very smart. They show taxi's both window half open and then male lead closing it. I didn't get what intelligence was behind it! Boy running behind car of girl, this shot is obsolete in today's cinema. Tortoise emotional angle is just flat, somehow you feel sympathy for tortoise but not for couple. Pre climax sequence of boat chasing in pond is most irritating. Performance wise, one can dare to cast Imran Khan if film has any emotional angle. He is as unbalanced as much he could have been. Kangana Ranaut looks complete reluctant. She is very average with a peculiar hair style. #MithilaParkar as Komal, younger sister is very good. She is completely balanced. Music by Shankar Ehassan Loy have tracks ""Lip To Lip De Kissiyan"" , Sau Aansu Roye Do Ankhiyan"" and "" Ishaq Da Rutba"", which are good."
tt4467262,7 only for the last 20 or odd minutes.. I feel like that's when story starts.. If you keep your patience till the last you will feel its worth a watch.. Yup movie could have been better in a thousand ways but its what it is and rater than criticizing it badly lets try and be fair and like this movie for what it is.. Obviously Imran and Kangana have done a heck of a job.. Kangana Suits best for climax and Imran for rest of movie.. May be a different cast would have done the job.. Other actors where just pain for eyes.. They just couldn't pull it through and they did have a important part for story to move on.. You could not like this movie but certainly can't hate this one at least it leaves a small impact inside you..
tt4467262,"The film has a story which is not new or fresh as love stories like this have been attempted in Hindi cinema before also. It is loosely inspired by Hollywood films 500 Days Of Summer, Sweet November and Chasing Amy. One more point about the screenplay which keeps troubling the audience is that too much time is devoted to Maddy trying to locate Payal. In today's time, tracing a loved one can't be as difficult as it becomes for Maddy. Therefore, rather than the audience feeling sad for Maddy, it ends up feeling irritated at his, so to say, inability and dumbness. Showing Maddy running (and literally, many times) in search of Payal looks rather silly.On the whole, Katti Batti lacks the depth of an intense love story and also lacks entertaining moments. Its tension-ridden climax is another minus point, from the box-office point of view. It will end up as a losing proposal as it fails to not only entertain but also emotionally move the audience. It wastes our time most comprehensively and completely."
tt4467262,"See the movie with your better half. And wait till the end, when all gets revealed to you.If you like 500 days of summer or something that keeps you interested then a good movie. The actors are just not that professionals to act in THIS serious movie. But the comedy is priceless. 20 min of comedy is in there.And for what happens in the movie, it all adds up to the events that lead to the the end. Cant push how mush it is necessary to see the end after watching the whole movieAnd for the supporting rolls. They are a hit or miss. This movie really forces those supporting actors to play in important roll. Some of the actors are great but some fall short.Hope you like the movie, me and my wife liked it. But loved the story"
tt4467262,Today i decided to saw this film i thought today its off from my job so lets watch the movie i decided to watched the afternoon show. I thought it would be interesting as they said comedy and romance but after watched i realized this movie is blood sucker nothing more. If you really want to save your time and money do not go for it instead of this just go for Everest if you have this in your city but do not watch Katti Batti I do not understand what Director of this movie thought before created this. I just wasted my time today on this so guys i hope you wont do this. But in Last its all your choice everyone has own opinions.
tt4467262,"This could well be the last film, for both the Director Nikhil Advani and Actor Imran Khan, when viewers will take note of them seriously. The film is targeted to multiplex movie-goers of metros with Hollywood inspired story telling style. The movie opens up well, as was the trailer of the movie which generated some interest among the target audience, but as we move along the story, the viewers feel cheated and deprived of the value for their money. The first half of the movie was so badly presented, trying to copy from Hollywood movies, that the last 15-20 min of the movie which was the best part of the movie helped by fine performance by ever improving Kangna Ranaut, instead of leaving the viewers in tears left them laughing at poker-face of Imran Khan and that is the irony of the movie.The film is centred around Imran Khan in (500) days of summer style of story telling. The offence of the Director is not just in failed attempt of copying 4-5 Hollywood movies but he gave little interest in character building of both Imran Khan and Kangana Ranaut. The role of Kangana, who is enjoying form of her life giving awesome performance in Queen and Tanu weds manu returns, in the movie except for last 15-20 min was meagre and she was left with only showcasing colorful, out of the world type dresses and ill-make up-ed hairstyles. The direction was good in only parts, trailer being better than the movie, and one wonders whether the movie is directed by some Ad director. Although, couple of song sequence was nicely filmed. The fight sequence in college, a sequence where Imran Khan pushes the bike while Kangana is still seated as pillion and a sequence in which Imran Khan's sister argues using facebook to convince Imran Khan that Kangana Ranaut is not committed to him is laughable, viewers's expect a lot better from the director.The supporting characters in the film are out of the world with a turtle as pet named Milkha, a south Indian boss who jumps and shouts at a decible which nearly ruptured viewers' eardrums, Imran Khan's sister who just tries to imitate the role of girl in (500) days of summer, college friends who can do anything to save 'not-so-dude' drunk guy from being caught by his parents, a male protagonist's best friend, a female protagonist's friend who is more worried about some Rs. 5 lac toilet seat pot than the condition of depressed Imran Khan and then there is a band group, every member of which is ditched by their better half, named F.O.S.L.A acronym for Frustrated One Sided Lover's Association, some may find it as newly invented word but the name is also borrowed from a not so famous Prakash Jha produced film Dil Dosti etc. The music of the film is average and one soon forget it as he/she steps out of the hall.The biggest let down of the movie is undoubtedly Imran Khan. The whole movie was centred around him but he gave a very poker-faced performance where he should have tried harder to twitch a facial muscle or two. In many sequences his acting made it look an average scene which should have been emotionally exhaustive scenes. His acting in later, serious part of the movie was summed up by the viewers' laughters in the partially filled hall where the director would have intended the spectators to shed some tears.Overall, the movie is a big let down and raises the question mark on the future career path of both director Nikhil Advani and the male protagonist Imran Khan."
tt4467262,"Ever since Imran Khan's JTYJN and Kangana's Fashion I wanted to see them on the big screen, I luv'em both a lot and they are both so talented and cute looking.
For some years I was into Russian culture so I barely watched any hindi movie, until recently that I heard in dono me movie agaya hai. I was so happy, remembering Imran Khan's interview in 2010 saying he'd like to do a movie with Kangana. I checked the IMDb and was shocked by the rating but I loved them too much to not give this movie a try.
Even though watching them together was a treat, Kangana looking incredibly gorrrrg and Imran looking as handsome as always, the movie was a mess. I couldn't help but fast forwarding it. I never thought I'd say this someday about a Kangana and Imran movie but, Not at all recommended!!!"
tt4467262,"Evening show on the first day of release , I must have been pretty excited to watch this one . The movie doesn't disappoint as a whole package especially for the romantic breed. Few comic punches , a bit slow story (slightly predictable) line and good songs make it worth an evening . The great cinematography and awesome singing of Ritu pathak and Nikhil Dsouza in 'Lip to Lip' alone carries half the charm of the movie and certainly gives you a tune to hum around. Somewhat slow towards the end , the director somehow manages well to show the different aspects of a love life ,though picturized more on Imran Khan , left me wishing more screen space and time for Kangana who effortlessly grabbed the presence off Imran. Overall a decent movie.. Go Watch.."
tt4467262,"Katti Batti is like watching poor watching version of ""Sweet November"". Boy met girl they both fell in love and one day "" snap"" girl left the boy without saying anything. We have seen all these kind of stuff in many movies and we have this again. Katti Batti is extremely boring, dull and way too much dragged. Too many loopholes in plot and complete half baked story is the biggest drawback. What's good : The chemistry between Imran and Kangana looks good and carried well. Picturization of song lip to lip is done very well.. Apart from that nothing holds you to entertain. What's Bad : So many things... Sleek storyline, dull and dragging plot as I told already. Some stupid jokes which not going to make u lol.. and comic scenes are forcefully pushed between nowhere... Supporting cast seems like took for granted all they can have is address and contact number & rescuing Imran khan from another heart break... too dramatic scenes like "" maa ke kangan"" and pet like "" Milkha"" seriously..???Now main star cast.. Imran Khan... He is the main star of the movie and he tried so much to make this movie work and somehow it worked... but all we know it's not his fault. It's his choice of movies. Emotional scenes are carried nicely by him but sometimes it's not...Now kangana.. honestly the reason I saw this movie is bcoz of her and I really disappointed coz she's hardly there. After making some brilliant movies why did she drained all her versatility by doing this kind of stuff where she don't have anything to do... I really wanna ask her what she did and why??Now we have Nikhil Advani.. I think after kal ho na ho. He forget how to make a good movie. And it seems like he is giving competition to sajid khan and others like him to make more craps... so I really wanna tell him that take as much as time you want. Come with a good story and make something which makes us forget what mess he done after kal ho na...All in all Katti Batti has nothing to offer anything new.. it's just old, boring and insensible movie wrapped into old and boring love story and too much emotions that makes you nothing but yawn... don't waste Ur time or money on that.."
tt4467262,"Well first of all I am absolutely shocked by the critics' negative reviews about this movie! This movie has proved to be one great entertainer! Katti Batti has the potential to touch your hearts! This movie has much of Imran Khan who is back after a long term break! And yes..he's actually back! The first half of the movie tickle's your funny bone! It makes you laugh and makes you feel that yes, love is there around you! The second half of the movie strikes the emotional chords! And the last 20 minutes of the movie leaves you with teary eyes! There is less of Kangana in Katti Batti! But her performance though less, is a strong an appreciable one! On the whole Katti Batti is a great watch! All the performances are great and entertaining! Go watch this flick and ignore the critics :)"
tt4467262,"Before the release, it was being speculated by many that probably Kangna Ranaut will rescue the film with her 'bindaas character' continuing from where she left in QUEEN or TANU WEDS MANU series. But personally I was quite firm on the conclusion that its rarely an actor that can save a badly conceived film not supported by any fine writing and direction. As a matter of fact, we recently saw the same happening with Kangnaonly in her poorly made projects such as REVOLVER RANI and the ill fated I LOVE NY. Yet many were still having a lot of faith on the actress that unfortunately gets completely shattered into pieces with her latest KATTI BATTI.Directed by Nikhil Advani, who delivered another lousy film HERO just last Friday (entirely depending upon the visible support coming from its producer Salman Khan), KATTI BATTI is nothing but another of those FILLER PRODUCTS made by the big production houses as per their commitment to serve the multiplexes on a regular basis. KATTI BATTI begins on a decent note (with the Kissiyan song shot/edited well), but then suddenly shifts on to such an awful gear accompanied by a mediocre soundtrack that literally makes you ask that does Kangna really considers herself a great actress with a newly found exceptional understanding of cinema? And did Nikhil Advani actually directed KAL HO NA HO or D-DAY himself or it was Karan Johar and some other creative mind behind those much better attempts?Moreover the film also makes you strongly question many of these lesser talented new age 'star-sons-daughters-nephews and nieces' that, do they realise that whatever they have achieved till date is all because of their gifted 'surnames' and not related to any of their inherited talents? Plus have they ever thought that in what number we have much more talented people struggling their ways towards a single chance that simply gets taken away by a 'now available star-son', who certainly has a more saleable market due to his family linkage, eventually spreading a much stronger feeling of discrimination, stress and bitterness among them all.However leaving the thought here for their individual introspection standing in front of the mirror, I would specifically like to address Kangna Ranaut, who tried hard to stop the release of I LOVE NY a few weeks back as it was a 'stuck movie' lying in cans since 2012. And if the 'National award winner' actress sincerely considered KATTI BATTI a much better film than I LOVE NY, then it certainly puts a big question mark on whatever film-writing courses she had supposedly done in the recent years. Because I LOVE NY at least had some kind of novelty in its basic theme that couldn't be executed well by its director-duo.In short, revolving around the same old theme of a terminally ill person sacrificing the love for all (as earlier seen in the director's KAL HO NA HO), here we have Imran Khaneffortlessly sleep walking in the entire film along with Kangna, who also turns out to be quite 'unimpressive' even in her 'bold scenes and dialogues' proving a known fact that it's the combination of a talented WRITER & DIRECTOR that makes the much appreciated reputation of an ACTOR but not the other way round.In the end, I would simply like to add that these big production houses keep serving us with the same content again and again and again, because we actually let them do so making no protests of any kind whatsoever as a paying viewer. So till we decide to show some concerning guts, this arrogant act of making such repetitive and ridiculous movies would continue as always without any major hindrance.Oh!, just forgot to mention AAMIR KHAN, the perfectionist uncle of KATTI BATTI's leading actor, who probably had helped in the film's editing too as per an 'unconfirmed' news.Who says AAMIR KHAN is not a great actor? In fact if a person can cry watching KATTI BATTI saying it really moved him a lot ...... then he surely is the greatest actor on the whole planet to say the least!"
tt4467262,"A film that ends with patti shatti!A long drab that tried desperately to make the viewer cry but failed at it coz' the viewer was already dead watching the pathetic pranks of college going idiots!! Story line:A negligibly dressed college female instantaneously falls in love with a dope male. She was in a relationship with another guy but she left him for the dope. She made a very quick decision here.Female was rich whereas the dope was not as rich as her – just belonged to a middle class family.Male and female are shown in compromising position in a small car – smooching and all – but indication is given that they were just cuddling kissing etc and not 'eff-ing'. Which also means that the girl – although who dressed mostly like how 'sl*ts' dress in India (that is what 90% of Indians believe btw. That a female who dresses up cheaply gives out vibes of being available and is game to jump on bed with anyone who catches her fancy! – yes, I know many people will scream and shout after reading the above line – but I am stating facts – and truth is always bitter) - she was a pure virgin – i.e. she had not even slept with her previous boyfriend (quite possible though). Then the dope and the rich female decide to live together! Wow! Such a modern thought that was!Then they mock at the sanctity of marriage! They pull in the dustbin, light the garbage lying in it – and start taking rounds of it (pheres) and then dive on bed...again! So basically this scene shows the utter failure of the institution of marriage! Both were from different family backgrounds – yet both mocked at marriage! The dope's parents seemed pretty simple and decent who must have done everything to raise their children as best as they could – but still their son turned out to be a drunkard and frivolous idiot who happily started to live together with a female. The female's parents are not shown in the film – but looks like they were filthy rich and let their daughter enjoy trips abroad and do whatever she felt like – live in, live out, not live – whatever! Then they started to fight. They parted ways. Later dope came to know that the female used to purposely fight with him because she was suffering from cancer – brain cancer I think – and hardly had any time left with her ...so she wanted him to hate her and start life afresh! Dope finds out and brings her back to his dilapidated apartment. She dies in the shabby surroundings.Conclusion – What can such dumb fools achieve by surviving anyway? Such frivolous fools bring forth more confused brats on planet earth and ruin the progress of the world! Such live-in fools can continue living –in but not bring forth children before wedlock because ultimately it is children born to such irresponsible idiots that create all the ruckus in the world!USP - The potty training scene by Kangana- There is something called potty –training that responsible parents (mothers especially) teach infants during their infanthood! Seems the dope's mom never gave him any potty training...and ultimately the rich female had to impart this basic knowledge to the dope! So basically even if she had not died of cancer – they would still have parted ways – a rich female belonging to high class and culture could not have continued to live with some uncouth middle class loser male for long..."
tt4467262,"Better than Kal ho na ho..very well directed, hits the mark right. May be inspired by few movies, but its treatment of movie it counts. Khnh compare is apple to orange...it was glorified, over the top, dramatized, no budget barrier movie...so it worked well with shahrukh and songs. .this one is more real, nicely acted, directed movie. Just don't miss it, ignore bad reviews by dummies. They couldn't handle slowness of movie, which was introduced on purpose to show state of minds confusion, and mystery. Watch it, and you'll know what it will reveal. Imrans best work after gori tere pyar me..and kangana is awesome as usual. She has lesser role here if you compare queen or gangster, but she has decent role. Music is average, editing is crisp. Watch with family, and all."
tt4365566,"This really wasn't bad. I've seen way worse when picking random Netflix horror movies. The boyfriend was annoying, but the rest of the acting wasn't bad. There were a few good jump scares. Nothing new here as far as the ""Ghost attaches itself to person and friends must find out how to banish it"" story. Instead of a video tape here, we have ""Ghost Houses"". I was entertained on a night where I couldn't find anything else to watch."
tt4365566,"Ghost House is worth a watch, it's a decent horror, with a few good moments, some decent scares, and it's well acted.My criticisms would come from the fact that it contains virtually every single horror cliche in existence. We have the wise woman, the long haired female ghost, an English villain, arched backs, a ceremony, literally everything you would expect to see in a horror film is on show here.Despite all that though, it is still a good watch, the beginning is very atmospheric, and the way in which the young couple are manipated into trouble is very well done.It's unsurprising, but decent. 6/10"
tt4365566,"The film starts off moderately ok with a couple vacationing in Thailand who visit an ancient burial site where they are attacked by an evil spirit that follows them throughout the vacation. The film then spirals into a mess of cliches, bad acting, predictable jump scares, and a story that does not hold your attention. The story becomes dull and uninteresting within 15 minutes of the opening, an opening that crams too much information into it, making questions one would have about the story answered already, leaving the story nearly non-existent.The jump scares are almost all the same. Girl is alone, ghost suddenly appears, girl freaks out. It may work the first few times, but you end up knowing what the scare is going to be before it happens. While the ghost from a distance could be considered by some as scary, up close it is not. The make-up job on the ghost is so poorly done, it renders the tensions useless and takes you out of the moment. The writing is also painfully dull, including characters with barely one dimension as well as conversations that leave you waiting for it to be over so the next scare will come.In short, if you are a horror veteran, skip it. If not and you want some cheap scares, go for it."
tt4365566,"I'd just like to know how much they paid GoGo after all this. Endless rescue trips, family medicine, travels to desolate parts of the country. Bloke deserves thousands of pounds at least."
tt4365566,"Meh another possession ""hand me down"" type of movie, or sacrifice to get rid of it. 1 or so parts were predictable, but honestly its just a movie to watch nothing really unexpected. This could have been a lot better, but it is what it is cause movie makers now a days that make ""scary"" movies SUCK AT IT!"
tt4365566,"An entire movie based on scary makeup. The same thing happens over and over: girl left alone, has vision of scary Asian lady, screams, boyfriend comes running. Aaaaand one more time! Felt like a miniseries. This could have been a 10m short though it still wouldn't be original. It's so boring you'll want to hit something."
tt4365566,"This is among the better lower budget supernatural movies out there, many are not so great - I've watched nearly all of them out there. The story is good! An American couple visiting Thailand get unwanted attention from a vengeful spirit. Plenty of good ""Gotcha"" moments if you like to jump! The script could be a little better but it's not bad, actors did their best with what they had. This movie is definitely worth a watch if you like scary ghost stories! Don't believe the snobs who wrote some bad reviews, for lower budget scary movies, this one is a lot of fun - great ending. There's a few sexually explicit scenes in case you have younger kids. Check this movie out!"
tt4365566,"20 min into the movie and I was hoping ghosts kill everyone involved with this project, starting with producers, writers and director. I don't know what species they belong to, because the behavior that they are trying to describe trough characters is far from normal human behavior. Not even sure is it flawed acting or bad writing, but their actions and interactions just do not seem natural nor human. Poor acting all around, especially from Russell Geoffrey Banks, who sounds like he was prompted for every single syllable he said during the movie. Hard to keep a blind eye to so much lapses, even harder to swallow such degree of amateurism. Don't even bother."
tt4365566,"We have seen the typical horror movie from Hollywood. Jump scares haunted mansion and the usual dark scene in the basement. First of all, this is not the standard template Hollywood horror we are used to. Contrary to the title, nothing happens in a haunted house but everything is a wild goose chase to get rid of a curse.Th movie is not a poorly made remake of any Asian stuff either. It's a Hollywood movie which happens in Asia, follows the Asian horror template closely and mixes a pseudo type adventure film with ""National Geographic's Banged up Abroad"" cum Indian Jones metaphor, with reference to a couple trapped in a foreign country having a problem with something they unknowingly messed with. The movie combines the usual jump scares of Hollywood, an ugly old ghost and ritual ceremonies, commonly seen in Asian horror. The acting performances are decent for the most parts. The plot flows smoothly for a good execution. However, the film works better in an adventure ""Indiana Jones"" type of film than horror. One of my main gripes about the movie is that the jump scares could have been better presented in a more scarier way, which of course is my own subjective opinion.Instead, it follows a generic method that has been used umpteen times in movies in the genre.However, there is enough suspense to keep u at the edge of your seat with the usual ""what will happen next?"" question. Watchable if u can overlook the horror elements and treat it as and adventure film"
tt4365566,"I went into Ghost House with low expectations, I believed it would be yet another generic cliched Hollywood horror film but was mistaken (In a way I hadn't expected).The Thai/US collaboration tells the story of a couple enjoying the sights of Thailand when one of them is tricked into desecrating a ""Ghost House"" and finds herself cursed.So basically it's nothing we haven't seen before so I was right to an extent, but I hadn't expected it to be quite this bad. Hollywood cliched nonsense is usually dire but they at least stick to a tried and tested formula that is passable to a degree, this isn't.The writing is appalling, the characters just aren't likeable preventing you from having any level of empathy and our antagonist is as engaging and original as run of the mill slasher film.As the credits rolled I was left in awe, did that really just happen I thought? Did they drop the ball that hard? Ghost House is genuinely that bad, has no redeeming qualities and had it not been for the production values would likely not even be getting the second star.The Good:Antagonist looks okayThe Bad:Weak charactersDreadfully writtenJust awful all round"
tt4365566,"On the arrival in Thailand, the Americans Jim (James Landry Hébert) and his girlfriend Julie (Scout Taylor-Compton) hire the polite chauffeur Gogo (Michael S. New) and his van at the airport. They sightsee Bangkok and learn the legend of the ghost houses, miniature houses where spirits peacefully live and do not haunt the living. Then Jim proposes Julie to marry him with an engagement ring. They meet the British Robert (Russell Geoffrey Banks) and Billy (Rich Lee Gray) in the hotel lobby and are invited to celebrate their engagement with them. Robert summons Jim to visit a fleshpots and Billy stays outside with Julie. When they leave the spot, Julie has an argument with Jim that is drunken and accepts Robert's invitation to visit ghost houses at the outskirts. Robert wears Julie's scarf about a doll's neck and then he flees with Billy leaving the American couple in the middle of nowhere. Julie does not feel well and Jim calls Gogo to find them and take Julie to a hospital. However, when Gogo sees Julie, he takes her to a nearby village where his aunts live. Then they take Julie to a monk that wears amulets about her wrist and Julie recovers. They return to the hotel and when Julie removes her amulets, she has dreadful visions. What has Robert done with Julie?""Ghost Story"" is a totally underrated horror film with a genuine ghost story. The creepy and spooky screenplay does not have flaws and explores the beauties and beliefs of the exotic Thailand with magnificent locations. The few special effects are excellent. The cast is great and the unknown Scout Taylor-Compton is a beautiful woman and has top-notch performance. In the en, ""Ghost Story"" is one of the best recently released horror film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available"
tt4365566,"Wow, was this a bad experience or what? Can't believe I even managed to sit it through entirely, tho it took me 2 tries and 2 days to complete it.Ghost House is a very lazy execution, with plenty of moments made just to fill in the running time, zero originality, bad special effects, poor ghost concept and a combo between characters and dialogue that will give you headaches. Sad such movies are still made, I don't even know their target audience, perhaps a mix, American-Asian-Horror fans, but I do believe in the end it managed to annoy every single one of us. This is something you have to stay far away from.Cheers!"
tt4365566,"I seen this pop up on my Netflix notifications so I decided to give it a try I always give the film 5 or 10 minutes before I decide if it's another bad cheesy horror film before I shut it off. This one made it. I have watched just about every horror movie out. I think they did a fantastic job on this film. Remember when watching this that it is not a huge budget film. The whole crew did a great job! A little predictable at times. This was diffinetly 10 steps above most lower budget films. If you are a true horror/thriller/dark movies lover I would recommend it. Had a pretty good script, good camera shots and just enough spooky to keep you on your toes. I hope to see more films from them. They definitely have potential. Great job to the cast and crew!"
tt4365566,"Not sure why there are so many negative responses published here to this absolutely competent nod to the Asian ""ghost"" genre.Yes, the story is cliched: An American disturbs some kind of relic and as a result is haunted by a vengeful spirit.What raises ""Ghost House"" up, however, are some beautiful locations, some obvious guerrilla-style filmmaking, interesting and creative direction and a funky visual style.Also, while the lead actors are often charmless and whiny, the supporting cast is a hoot, from an old hippie shaman to a Thai witch doctor whose facial expressions are extraordinary. It's obvious they hired a number of Thai locals in these supporting parts, and that lends needed authenticity to the film.Most of the scares are ""jumps,"" but effective, and there are a couple of real harrowing and haunting scenes.At the end of the day, ""Ghost House"" transcends it's weaknesses to become, as a whole, a decent, interesting effort that's worth your time."
tt4365566,"Saw this recently on a DVD. Found it to be lame n full of clichés. The film is about an American couple holidaying in Thailand who find themselves haunted by an evil spirit. This film has shades of Drag me to hell, a la the spirit will torture for three days n will consume after that. Well, the director of this film ain't no Raimi who did a terrific job with Drag me... Here the scares r annoying at times because its been done so many times. Pretty much everything is borrowed. The film does boast of some good cinematography. The Thai countryside has been shot very well. The place where the shaman lives is almost like the lair of Medusa from Clash of the titans n also similar to the castle of the wizard from Conan the destroyer. Situated in the middle of nowhere, the road/way to it is totally spooky with the mist n water surrounding it. But what do these shaman eat n what do they do without any amenities or other stuff? Personally, i have disliked most Asian horror scares i.e. scary girls with black hair, twisted bodies, disjointed movements, old witches, hollow faces, dark eyes, sudden jump scares n pop ups. Some of its effectiveness has been diluted by imitation. Demonic possessions premise has been done so many times that only die hard fans of the genre may enjoy this."
tt4365566,"Saw 'Ghost House', being fond of horror/thriller regardless of budget (even if not my favourite genre) and being intrigued somewhat by the idea. Being behind on my film watching and reviewing, with a long to watch and review list that keeps getting longer, it took me a while to get round to reviewing it.Unfortunately, despite not reading any reviews purposefully before watching, am going to have to agree that 'Ghost House' is not really good. A film that started off okay, but ran out of steam very quickly and rapidly got worse by a second half that makes one not want to keep watching. Never judge a film without seeing the whole thing and wanted to give 'Ghost House', so gave it a fair chance.'Ghost House's' best assets were the production values, which did have some eeriness and nowhere near as cheap as expected, and the music, which not the most memorable in the world didn't detract from the atmosphere. Although too rushed with too much crammed in that keeping up is not completely easy, the first fifteen minutes are actually the most interesting the story gets.However, so much brings 'Ghost House' down. The cast have no chemistry at all and nobody is above mediocre (most awful) and the direction is so phoned in and pedestrian, one gets the sense that the director showed no interest in the film at all.Where 'Ghost House' most underwhelms is the writing and story. The far too exposition-heavy writing is incredibly lazy, it's awkward in dialogue, very confused as a result of not tying things up or going into full detail and doesn't feel complete. The story suffers from a very limp pace after the first fifteen minutes and gets slower and slower until an interminably dragged out second half. It further suffers from feeling too much like a short film stretched out with a lot of useless padding and tiresome repetition. The characters are uninteresting and annoying and the inconsistent and illogical motivations bring them down. For a film billed as a horror, there is very little interesting and nothing remotely scary. They are too few and are far too predictable, anaemic and weakly timed to make impact, with the dull pacing and obvious sound effects cheapening them significantly. In terms of the thriller elements, 'Ghost House' doesn't engage let alone thrill, the film started off very well but feels wasted by how quickly everything runs out of steam. The ending is an anti-climactic head-scratcher.Overall, weak but not a waste. 3/10 Bethany Cox"
tt4842270,"The movie to its credit it has its comedic moments, but it also has its downfalls and flaws. The action was well-executed. Once again the funniest part about a Vice Ganda film is his fellow gay co- stars, and Coco and Vice's obvious chemistry, and the hit-and-miss jokes are (for the most part) great, when the joke hits--it's funny and it gets you a bit of a laugh or giggle here and there, but on the other hand, when the jokes are a miss..oh boy it is a MISS. Let me also point out Nadine and James (aka JADINE), these two were one of the most disappointing things about this film. Their relationship is way too forced, the dialogue is insultingly bad and the acting is beyond lazy. They had little to no help in moving the story along, it's sad because these two have Proved (movie and TV) that they can do better, they can be funny, but for now, they're just wasted cast.Although a solid first half, this movie suffers from most Filipino comedies, ESPECIALLY Vice Ganda's movies, and that's having too much focus on the first half and having little-to-no effort in the second. It also suffers from, again, most Filipino comedies; it tries to throw too many jokes all at once that it ultimately ends up awkward and a mess. JADINE was out of place. The story had no proper focus. Coco and Vice's comedic chemistry had so much potential but wasn't exploited enough. Writing gets lazy into the second part, the dialogue is painfully awkward. The pacing was either going too fast or too slow and the plot didn't make sense for the most part.If you're with a group of friends looking to kill time (2 hours to be exact. Really? TWO hours for a COMEDY?) I'd say go watch it. But I'll say that Beauty and the Bestie is an awkwardly written, unevenly paced, waste of potential.""Come for the first half, stay because these are expensive tickets."""
tt4842270,"Emman, a policeman, needs his former best friend, Erika, to be an asset to a mission. Craziness is all I have to say. I laughed as much as I expected. I liked the way they're breaking the fourth wall, you know if you watch classic Filipino films like Rene Requiestas introducing the director in the middle of the movie. The chemistry between Coco Martin and Vice Ganda is absolutely effective. The fighting scenes in this movie are better than some other serious Action Drama films. It gives justice to the action genre through the production design and choreography. It was satisfying to watch it with laughs but there are some obviously unsettling moods. The supporting love story, JaDine, is out of place. Another problem was the movie trying not to be awkward on drama scenes. It made the audience not care about that character.A new flavor for a Wenn Deramas movie. I must say this is a worth watching two-hour comedy film."
tt4842270,"I think this is the best film of Vice-Wenn tandem yet. The actions, the jokes are really funny and exciting. You can't predict what is going to happen in every scenes. JaDine tandem also did a splendid role in the movie. They have a potential in comedy, specially Nadine, which I enjoyed much. Coco Martin's role was stunning. His action-themed persona in ""Ang Probinsyano"" also appears in this movie. He is also good in comedy, together with his best friend Vice. I think they should team up again in the next project. Highly recommended, 'cause Vice and Coco has a chemistry to burst into laughter in theaters every time they have a conversation with each other. MC and Lassy did a job well done also the two kids, Marco Masa and Alonzo Muhlach. The storyline is good, but i'm not satisfied. It's ordinary, with a little bit of spice. When the movie finished, there was a question left on my head, saying that this film should deserve an award for Best Comedy Movie ever. If Wenn Deramas is planning to have a sequel on this movie, please make it well prepared, because ""The Amazing Praybeyt Benjamin"" was not planned, the story line is a mess. They just made that movie for the high gross, which is true. Beauty and the Bestie deserved a well prepared and a solid storyline in the sequel."
tt5034474,"This isn't an awful movie and it does have some good moments, but I struggle to think that it really works. Firstly the story itself is pretty improbable although the idea of a mad surgeon wanted to experiment is not new it is still a bizarre thing to want to do, especially to worry about the quality of her work when changing the guys sex to female. Michelle Rodriguez does a pretty good acting job but never really convinces that she is ever male. From the outset it looked like a girl with a beard, apart from the shower scene where they must have used either CGI or good prosthetic. She also didn't really convince as an assassin and made some pretty silly errors of judgement but I guess that is down to the script rather than acting. So over all I have mixed feelings. It isn't a bad movie just not a great one."
tt5034474,"Forget the uproar from sensitive trans groups, this film was never transphobic, it was just a classic revenge thriller. Waking up as the opposite sex is the worst thing imaginable for the overwhelming majority of society and tat's the crux of the film - not an attack on trans. If anything, its success would spark a franchise of a kick-ass trans-woman - talk about giving trans the spotlight! I am trans myself and I was looking forward to it as it seemed to be a throwback to the films I grew up on in the 80s when one man would avenge his life being ruined (usually his family being massacred). However this film was dull and muddled and riddled with exposition.The biggest problem is that it's told in flashback and with lots of - literally - one character 'talking' the story to another (Frank to the camera, the Doctor to the other doctor) and as a result there was no tension only on the nose dialogue. The other problem was a completely unlikeable anti-hero in Frank and a completely unbelievable performance by Michelle Rodriguez who never once convinced she was a man with her female frame, female build, female skin and female voice. Similarly, Weaver's The Doctor was lacking. I appreciate she was playing an aloof, detached character but there was nothing to her character. There was no bad guy you wanted to root against just as there was no protagonist you wanted to root for.This film could have been a solid, action-filled romp had it been told in a linear fashion and with stronger characterisation. As it was, it was a boring affair with too little action, style or interesting characters. The IDIOTS who say it's transphobic are, well, idiots. It's no more transphobic as Death Wish was phobic to people who have been raped and murdered."
tt5034474,"The Assignment (2016) *** (out of 4)Frank Kitchen (Michelle Rodriguez) is a hitman who pulls a job not knowing what impact it will have on him. It turns out that he murdered the brother of a doctor (Sigourney Weaver) who gets her revenge by kidnapping Frank and turning him into a woman. Now, as a woman, Frank must seek revenge against those who did this to him.Walter Hill got back into the director's chair with THE ASSIGNMENT, which is certainly one of the biggest WTF movies to come along in a very long time. Seriously, this here is something you would have expected in the 1970s but not in today's political climate. Sure enough, the film was released to all sorts of controversy with various groups being offended by the story. I must admit that there are a lot of flaws with the movie but at the same time it's so darn weird that I couldn't help but be entertained.As I said, this is a very strange movie on a lot of levels but if you've ever wanted to see Rodriguez with a beard and a dick then you'll love it. Yes, you actually see that as the film is quite sleazy in its own right and that includes a lot of nudity once the ""female"" side comes out. The movie is somewhat brave in what it attempts to do and I guess you could say that Rodriguez gives a rather brave performance. Not only is she constantly naked on the screen but this wasn't the easiest roles to pull off. She certainly handles the action quite nicely and she's strong enough to hold your attention throughout.I think the biggest problem with the film are the scenes inside the mental hospital where the Weaver character is telling her story. These scenes really take away from the revenge side of things and there's just no doubt that these moments aren't nearly as entertaining as the stuff with the hitman seeking revenge. The action scenes are directed quite nicely by Hill and it was great seeing him add some style back to his films. The movie looks and sounds quite good but it does start to lose its story as it moves along.THE ASSIGNMENT isn't a film meant for everyone but if you like weird movies you should find it entertaining."
tt5034474,They should have had a man play the part of the male Frank Kitchen. Also should have voice-overed Michelle Rodriguez's voice. Her fake guy voice with accent sounded forced.
tt5034474,"...then started to doze off. Came to look at the reviews before deciding if I should finish it, and they made my decision for me - not going to. Women playing men never works in movies. They try to adjust their voices, and it just sounds fake. And most don't walk anything like men, and the hips certainly don't lie. Also, the transition was far to unbelievable - it was basically instant. Other than that, the action wasn't particularly exciting. No idea where the story line on Weaver's character goes, but I lost interest and simply don't care. I doubt you will either."

There are enough colourful roles in the support cast delivering acceptable acting, such as : Tony Shalhoub as a strange doctor , Anthony LaPaglia as a cunning mobster , Caitlin Gerard as the girl who aids the series killer , and brief performances from Ken Kirzinger , Darryl Quon , Adrian Hough , Caroline Chan, Paul McGillion and the great Sigourney Weaver giving the best acting .It packs functional and atmospheric cinematography by cameraman James Liston . And moving and thrilling musical score by the veteran Giorgo Moroder and Raney Shockne . The motion picture was regular but professionally directed by Walter Hill , though here he hasn't improved his previous thrillers , resulting in an intriguing but boring and tiring flick .The veteran craftsman Hill is a good writer , producer , filmmaker who has made a lot of films of all kinds of genres , working from late 60s , early 70s to nowadays . As he has directed action movies as Hard times , The driver , Southern comfort , The warriors , Extreme prejudice , 48 Hours , Another 48 hours , Last man standing , Johnny Handsome , Undisputed. Science fiction genre : Supernova . Western: Geronimo American legend , Wild Bill , Long riders . Comedy : Brewster's millions . Terror : Tales of the Crypt . Musical : Crossroads . The Assignment (2016) Rating 5/10. Average and inferior than others Walter Hill pics."
tt5034474,"I mean for a movie with these good names in it, you would expect something good. I ain't saying perfect, but good. I was going to end the movie somewhere after it started because it was really terrible, looked very cheap and made up. Plot is even worse. The story can get a 3 maybe, but its really bad. Maybe because of the famous faces in it, i don't know, i got some expectations before hand. But still, don't waste your time on it. I just did an account to tell u that."
tt5034474,"Yay, another movie with two of my favorite female performers; Michelle Rodriguez and Sigourney Weaver in the same movie. Actually, I had not read up about this movie prior to getting the chance to sit down and watch it. All that mattered was it was an action/thriller movie with two of the most talented and charismatic of female actresses in Hollywood.""The Assignment"" didn't fail to impress. Surely, the storyline was a bit offbeat, but that quickly seeped in and you get with the story and movie quickly enough. And it was rather surreal to see Michelle Rodriguez as a man in the beginning of the movie, but it was done so nicely that it actually looked quite real. Color me impressed.Of course it is a bit redundant to mention that ""The Assignment"" had a really impressive cast ensemble. And even more needless is it to say that both Michelle Rodriguez and Sigourney Weaver were really impressive in this movie. Rodriguez carried the action and butt-kicking part, while Weaver was superb in a deranged sort of diabolical doctor role. It was also nice to have both Tony Shalhoub and Anthony LaPaglia in the movie, despite having only supportive roles.The story in ""The Assignment"" was good, although it could have been better with a bit more action. But of course, that is a matter of personal preference. There was a bit too much focus on the drama and storytelling for my liking, so of course I would have liked more action sequences.""The Assignment"" is an entertaining movie and I found it to be quite well worth sitting down to watch. However, truthfully, then I think that it is a movie that doesn't really have enough contents to sustain multiple viewings."
tt5034474,"The plot is centered on a hit man named Frank Kitchen, played by Michelle Rodriguez, who pisses off the wrong black market plastic surgeon (Sigourney Weaver) by killing her brother being Rodriguez's assignment. Exacting her revenge on Kitchen, the doctor in a rather unorthodox method forces a sex change operation on him to become a woman as a form of psychological torture on Frank to endure the rest of his/her life without any way of fully reversing the procedure. Obviously a tad bit peeved by this, Frank Kitchen seeks retribution for the crimes committed against his body and goes on a one-way killing spree to end the evil doctor's rein of terror.On paper, this sounds like it would be interesting. No matter what one person's views may be on how good or bad the premise sounds, it is a safe bet that most would hear this synopsis and be at least a little intrigued by it. I can't say that I've ever come across a movie with a plot motivation even remotely similar to ""The Assignment"". Unfortunately the execution felt sloppy, drawn out, dull, and all around unoriginal. This same exact movie could probably exist beat for beat without the introduction to any sort of gender reassignment operation in the script. Just another quick rewrite and this is your basic revenge film, only with far less interesting characters or action set pieces to be entranced by. The movie goes back and forth within its timeline to tell the story with one line following the plot of Frank Kitchen getting the procedure done to him and seeking answers as well as revenge on the doctor. The second line is set after the events of Kitchen finding and putting an end to the doctor's black market business with the doctor being interviewed by a psychiatrist in an insane asylum about what really went down. The secondary thread feels like a waste of time only to put the plot on hold and pad out the film to make its 90 minute run time. If everything containing Sigourney Weaver in the interview sections were taken out, while putting more focus on the actual main plot to include maybe some more character development and hopefully a lot more action beats, this movie would have succeeded at being an entertaining sit. Unfortunately those sections remain, leaving the story to feel dry and leaving zero impact. I know little to nothing about Frank Kitchen, nor do I care about him/her. Michelle Rodriguez does a great job, as always, being a total bad-ass. She carries her own very well, knows how to come across as intense and cool at all times. Her character just has little for her to work with, but she sells being a man forcefully transitioned into a woman terrifically. As I mentioned before, the movie could have used some more action beats. The action is so minimal and shortly lived I couldn't find much fun to be had. No real intensity or thrills from any action scene on screen. The script comes across as if the writer was twiddling his thumbs until the script reached the hour and a half mark. It has no bite to the action or story, no defining personality that can't be found in countless other revenge films, and such limited humor with a premise as quirky as this could have greatly used. Plus with a plot revolving a hit man turned into a woman, the writers had so many opportunities to play with that idea. There are several scenarios, gimmicks, tricks, and just fun that could have been toyed around with to mix things up and give a much more unique experience. Instead the screenplay squanders this and gives nothing in return. It's as though the first act setup and the prologue were extended and edited into the entirety of the film. For myself, that didn't work and I found myself pretty bored throughout. Also there was one or two plot twists that of course a film like this has, one of them made zero sense and could have been cut while the other had no emotional impact on me whatsoever.This movie is from the same director that gave us ""The Warriors"", ""48 Hours"", ""Another 48 Hours"", ""The Driver"", ""Red Heat"", ""Last Man Standing""...this man knows how to make an action movie. This man knows how to make a unique premise memorable, fun, humorous, intense, cool, and exhilarating. I don't understand what happened here. From the direction I could tell this was Walter Hill's style, it is a decent looking film with competently made action sequences. Rare as those scenes may be. In the end, this film isn't truly awful but it doesn't have nearly enough entertainment value to it in order for myself to recommend it. Michelle Rodriguez has a good action lead presence, but isn't given enough character to sink her teeth into. Sigourney Weaver plays crazy pretty well and I did like her performance, but there was more character development provided for her in detriment to Rodriguez's character. The action held little to no impact or energy and the story is nothing memorable. I got nothing else for this movie and I honestly wrote about it way more than I intended. Go watch ""The Warriors"" if you need a Walter Hill action movie fix."
tt5034474,"First time reviewer. What prompted me to write about this movie is how unusual it is. Interesting premise, and yet written as if by a talented high schooler. The dialogue is so obviously artificial and yet written with artistic intent. An unsympathetic viewer will rightly trash the film as juvenile, and yet a more open viewing may perceive the strained charm that the film almost achieves.Consider the experiment. Would changing a violent man's gender change him for the better? Interesting question (at least for me). More broadly, how would such a man respond to the sudden change? The movie attempts to present this scenario and provide an interesting response. I think it succeeds.Look past the actual effects that change Rodriquez into a man. Sure, they don't perfectly succeed, but suspend your critical attention and accept the basic fact of his existence. You can also look past Weaver's awkward dialogue and forced encounters and simply take what she says without concern for verisimilitude, if you can.This film is deeply flawed and deserves a poor grade, and yet offers an interesting and fairly entertaining experience. I would take this over the multitude of blockbusters that spend millions on special effects and star actors and then forget to pay a decent writer. Movies that have no point, no ambition, and nothing to say.Well, the Assignment as something to say, and it's worth hearing."
tt5034474,"Some places it's called Tomboy and some places it's called The Assignment, I'm Confused!!. Anyway, it's a very strange and somewhat creepy film in my opinion that I never really got in to. Some really bad acting in parts by the cast and Michelle Rodriguez who I usually rate highly!. Also, I didn't really see the point of some of the characters but maybe I'm missing something. In conclusion, it was very dull and quite a mess. I wouldn't recommend."
tt5034474,"I think Michelle Rodriguez did a great job. Her attitude was that of a man, yet when she started stripping she still enticed!The story line was interesting enough to keep watching and Sigourney did a great job with her superiority complex and cold confident statements.~give change a chance."
tt5034474,"Love Michelle Rodriguez. Love Sigourney Weaver. But, what...in the world...was that?? Original concept. Poor execution. It's not so much about their acting. It's just that no one, in their right mind, would buy into Rodriguez being a man. She's way too feminine. Not to mention, the writing is horrible. This neo-noir wannabe film just doesn't quite hit the mark. I do not recommend this...to anyone."
tt5034474,"I don't understand why this film gets such poor reviews. Sure, Sigourney Weavers' weren't the best lines she has ever spoken in front of a camera, but, all in all, I thought ""the Assignment"" was a decent old school action movie, directed by Walter Hill (of ""the Warriors"" fame). I felt like Michelle Rodriguez did a credible job as a transgender to the point where, like another reviewer on this website mentioned, I found myself thinking of her as a man, even during the nude scenes, and I thought her performance while she comes to terms with what has happened to her to be very much how I imagine I would feel myself if I would wake up a woman one day. Of course, this is not a psychological drama but an action movie, so the main focus is on that and I thought Walter Hill did a very good job creating a dark, gritty atmosphere, which, combined with a synthesizer soundtrack that reminded me of John Carpenter, plenty of nudity and Michelle Rodriguez' biker jacket to turn this movie into an instant cult classic."
tt5034474,"I mean.. What the hell am I even watched? Walter Hill was such a talented director, what happend here? The plot, the characters, the ending, the lead and even the damn actions.. Everything is a mess. Please do not watch this horrible movie!"
tt5034474,"The Assignment without a doubt will be the new cult classic of this generation with one of the most crazy and insane plot that i can only imagine.Directed by Walter Hill a man that deliver many great action movie in the 90s this movie told a bloody revenge story about a hit- man named Frank Kitchen played by Michelle Rodriguez(I know right) a guy with a girly face,a girly body and a girly voice get a transgender surgery by a doctor played by Sigourney Weaver after killing her brother now he has to seeking for justice with his new identity as a girl.Repeat this is not you usual girl with gun on the run but movie when is dealing with a lot of modern controversial topic and taboo stuff that for me is very intriguing to hear.The character is flesh out very well when each of them has their own character depth and they chemistry on screen is on point.The action is not all that new and amazing just you typical Run 'n Gun but it pretty solid for the most part.Recommend it for anyone who not offend by the stuff i list up there"
tt5034474,I don't understand why it it has scored so low. I really liked it. It was a bit slow to start and a bit complicated. It may have been a bit too confronting for some viewers as it pushed boundaries. overall a good film that was a bit different from the rest. If you are middle America then don't bother to watch it.
tt5034474,"As a trans women I found this movie to be wildly offensive. The idea that any man can just undergo one surgery and become a beautiful women is so inaccurate and stupid.I just can't. This film is infuriating. No part of it is accurate in any way shape or form.I can't believe Michelle Rodriguez, sigourney Weaver, and Tony shaloub would do this film.I can't believe any studio would give a director money to create it."
tt5539054,"Tyler (Taylor John Smith) is deeply in love with new girl Ali (Halston Sage). He's even willing to do yoga for her. It's the last week of the summer and they go to a friend's party. They encounter Ali's sleazy ex Chase from San Francisco. Tyler has a fight with Ali and leaves the party with unknown girl Holly (Bella Thorne). Tyler has a short drug filled sexual escapade. Afterward, he makes up with Ali but is shocked to find Holly attending their school.This one hits all the expected tropes and I actually was hoping for a bunny boil. Tyler is a pathetic unappealing dumb character. The only good aspect is the casting of Sage and Thorne. Sage is a solid good girl and Thorne is perfect as hot crazy. I don't think Thorne can really play the innocent good girl at this point. Using Tyler as the point of view is not compelling. There is no rooting interest in him. He almost redeems himself confessing to Lydia at the hospital but stupid writing immediately takes it all back. He talks face to face with Ali and fails utterly to warn her against Holly. There are so many laughable moments in the third act. It's derivative and unappealing at first and then it devolves into a bad thriller. The actresses are good although the male lead is saddled with a bad role."
tt5539054,"A total cliché. I could predict almost everything in this movie.What is enjoyable about this movie? Hmmmm... I don't know. I think I kept watching it just to see if it would really turn out the way I thought it would. And it did. Girl likes boys who doesn't like her back. Girl becomes obsessed. Girl pretends to be normal. Boy tries to get away from girl. Nobody believes in boy. The rest... you can predict, believe me.Had I known this I really wouldn't waste my time."
tt5539054,"And why did I sit through it? I have been a user of IMDb for years but never bothered to sign in to write a review. This movie compelled me to do so, and not in a good way.Actually, it may have been a good movie had it been made oh...30 or so years ago. But the plot has been done sooooooo many times now that every single second was predictable. The acting was bland (other than the young Asian woman who actually had a bit of a range other than 'smiling teenager', 'terrified teenager' or 'stalker teenager'). I have no idea whose idea it was to make this movie but it was a bad one. I was reminded immediately of 'Swim Fan' and going even further back, when Mark Whalberg was just past his Marky Mark phase and made 'Fear' with a young Reese Whitherspoon. Not to mention all of the zillions of Lifetime movies with the same plot, all of the excellently done Scream films, and even some elements of Beverly Hills 90210. Gah.Don't waste your time."
tt5539054,"Okay, there is literally nothing new in this movie. That being said, it is pretty entertaining and you probably won't turn it off. Bella Thorne, Halston Sage, and Taylor John Smith all turn in good performances and make up for some lackluster writing. A few less clichés and I think this movie would be more acceptable to most people, but again it was quite entertaining, fun, and enjoyable. It's not going to win any awards but that isn't the reason that you'd put a movie like this on, is it?"
tt5539054,"Every frame of this movie was cliché and predictable, and I mean that. Not one time was I surprised by anything that happened. It was a chore to watch and a painful one at that. If you've seen Swimfan then you have literally seen this movie before, right down to the final scenes. And this movie makes THAT one seem like a masterpiece. Dry acting, terrible dialog, zero chemistry between any of the characters and an overdone plot. Why would anyone finance this, let alone film and market it? A goofy protagonist who does the exact opposite of what he should do at every turn, a bland love interest and a faux sexy tryhard of a ""seductress"" do not make for a good cast, nor interesting characters. The worst part is, they didn't even bother to at least make the movie FUN. It was void of a single shred of humor or levity. How can a movie this trite have the gall to take itself seriously??This really was a terrible movie all around. I can't even see this being enjoyable for the teens and tweens out for summer break. Avoid at all costs. Show Netflix that they need to invest more wisely with regard to the projects they produce (or purchase)."
tt5539054,I don't know why there are so many bad reviews of this movie. I found it really enjoyable of course not brilliant but pretty good for night.
tt5539054,Absolute loved this movie. I think the guy getting stalked deserved all he got for using the hottest girl ive ever seen lol its abit strange how they used a girl hotter than the guys girlfriend in the movie.
tt5539054,"Surprised at most of these 1-3 ratings and reviews. Movie had great entertainment value. Good suspense, acting, and certainly worth the watch."
tt5539054,"Fhoof, it was a painfully long hour and twenty-something minutes... From the first few cuts is is obvious that this is something cheep and amateurish, but the basic script and the plain (or rather boring) staging and directing is more painful, than I would imagine.The story is cliché, acting evokes mickey mouse club, cinematography and directing is faulty at best.I am no director, but I had countless ideas during the flick, what I would have done differently. If you have a shitty script, at least you could fill the gaps with charisma, imagination and create a gripping atmosphere and let go of the owlishness. Could have gone more conscious about being a below-average ""drama"", 'cause labeling this a thriller is deceptive. Could have been more campy at least, could have played with film references from so many great productions like 2001 a space odyssey, basic instinct, cruel intentions, single white female, brick etc...There is no atmosphere, no rhythm, dialogues skip the beat throughout the movie. There is nothing visually or artistically engaging or entertaining, this whole thing lingers in limbo.The music... dunno it just bothered me, it wanted to sell everything the compositions, setting, staging, editing should've done.The creators of this skipped their homework on film-making BIG TIME.If you are about to direct your first feature, watch this and learn WHAT NOT TO DO! Otherwise avoid this flick, offers nothing and delivers even less..."
tt5539054,What the heck. whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy mannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
tt5539054,This was your standard simple obsession thriller film. You knew how things were going to end up and it was predictable. Besides the eye candy as major draws nothing else is alluring about this film. It might have done better if it was made about 30 or so years ago but today it falls short.
tt5539054,"I hope in the event I try to watch this movie or any as bad as it in the future that my tv explodes. I would rather s#*% in my own hands and then clap than sit through this again. Oh the things I could've accomplished during the time I wasted watching this, I could've stood on a plug every minute for the duration of the film and it would've been more enjoyable."
tt5539054,It's not as bad as so many portages here. If u got time u can watch this flick. Decent thriller...
tt5539054,"This is pretty mediocre and bad.First the acting is regular at best.Second the story is nothing revolutionary or anything. And most important, this doesn't bring anything new and is full of all the typical clichés and movie tropes.Unless you like obviously predictable movies don't watch this mediocre film"
tt5539054,"Hunky guy (Tyler) has a nice girlfriend (Ali), but they have a difference of opinion at a party and he splits, but gets picked up by a girl he chance upon earlier (Holly) and taken for a ride (a 'day-ride', I guess). Soon, he discovers that Ali did not intend to terminate the relationship after all - in fact, Ali is a polite, exemplary young lady, who has abandoned some 'party' habits she used to pursue, and seems like the kind of high school sweetheart you might marry one day. That means Holly gets dumped, of course, written off as a one-night stand, but since she now attends the same high school, she can insert herself into Tyler's circle of friends, and make his life miserable.It's all been done before, and I kept my hand on the FF button skipping over a few brief egregious moments, but it seems to be a PG type of flick. Tyler really isn't the cad his actions seem to indicate - but, as the Eagles say, 'in a New York minute, things can get pretty strange..' A passable teen-romance-gone-bad suspense movie from Netflix; yet, the sad thing is: people in their 50's are getting into these kind of jams these days -- they ought to know better - after all: 'the wolf is always at the door.'"
tt5539054,Extremely predictable. Acting was bad. Actors looked too old to even be high schoolers. It would've made a lot more sense for the characters to be in college. This movie is just another stereotypical Hollywood movie. Not worth wasting your time and watching this movie.
tt5539054,I watched this movie before I looked at some of the deceiving reviews. I am glad I went that way because chances are is it probably wouldn't of had the open mind to give this movie the chance any movie deserves. About 3 quarters of the way into the movie is was on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. So the excuse I read by one of the hired Internet trolls that this was a predictable movie is deceitful and dishonest.Unfortunately the trolls won't go away. As long as Hollywood desires a monopoly of who they choose to create the content we watch and attempt to get rid of any threat to there circle I get it won't read a review ever until I myself watch first without any ideas someone tried to get in my head
tt5539054,"A great Netflix original film. While it's cliché and predictable, I was really impressed with the visual effects that gave it such a surreal feeling. While the acting was sub-par, it had a very well-rounded cast that delivered when needed. And Bella Thorne made a perfect psychotic villain."
tt6271110,Total waste of time. There's hardly even any saving grace.
tt6959666,Thank you for proving once again that in Germany laughter is like antibody. Netflix buys open mics now or what? I have seen a couple bad shows but this is the new low for me. F me!
tt6423578,... mess with! That is me putting it mildly and using language that will not get this deleted. No pun intended - and also something that you have to think about ... do you want to watch a movie that is or could be declared an erotic thriller? With character decision that feel ... quite wrong to say the least of course.I think I am quite lenient with my rating - I would not be surprised if the majority has issues with the movie. And the nudity and other things will not entirely be able to make up for it. Just be aware of what you are about to watch. Otherwise it would be a waste of time ... there is a twist towards the end ... not sure if it is surprising ... but it is there and it might be able to sway a few people ...
tt6423578,The rating is basically because of the sex scenes and the attractive women. They never show what happened to the first one stephanie after he dumped her. As for the pork bone soup. I won't be going near that at all. They don't really show in detail the important parts of the movie. I guess they had a limited budget.
tt6423578,"The movie was filmed as a porn with so called ""storyline"". It's totally like 90s hk porn film just the background is Singapore instead. No new elements, unprofessional acting. I rate 3 cuz the nudity part, if no nudity, probably 1.5 rating."
tt6423578,"A softcore film with bad sound effects. The reviews that have come before me are all correct and true. I wasn't scared once, and the plot line is so basic. That you could tell it in 6 sentences.I'm just adding one star for Angeline Yap and the other girls who did their best to carry this film. They looked beautiful in it. The Actresses did nothing wrong.A better softcore film, would be ""High Society"" 2018 Korean-movie."
tt6423578,"Zack is a philanderer and a conman. In the early scenes we see him getting into a relationship Stephanie. He persuades her to give him a large sum of money, telling her a property deal went wrong. Soon afterwards she catches him with another woman... he dumps her and we see her heading to the roof of a tall building. Zack moves onto Li Ling, a woman living with her sister Li Er. It isn't long before he is having sex with both of them. Inevitably things will ultimately get rather unpleasant... but for whom?I was rather surprised by the low rating for this film as I thought it was rather fun in a twisted and unpleasant way. It is shot with a washed out colour palette that gives everything a grungy feeling and makes the pork bone soup they regularly eat look grey and unappetising... somewhat appropriately. There are relatively few characters and the cast playing them goes a solid job. There is quite a lot of sex and nudity; certainly more than I expected from a Singaporean film. There is also some violence, this isn't particularly graphic but it is disturbing at times. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of more outré cinema looking for something from somewhere different.These comments are based on watching the film in Mandarin with English subtitles."
tt7827944,"I had thought the sequel will be great not until I saw it, I felt embarrassed, don't waste your time watching, too much of lavishing"
tt7827944,"Not even worth being filmed. Actors are weak, script was written by a 12 year old. Poor sound quality."
tt7871636,"You're waiting to see comedy, but instead you see absurdity!
I think that the actors are not bad, but the script is horrible, and not funny at all!
I don't understand how people do laugh at this ineptitude, puerility foolishness job!"
tt7871636,"Trust me if you have children please do not make the mistake to let them see it is awfull... and what comedy ?? i was confused not amused..... please i beg those who make some kind of movies to think before makes another because the first was bad, the second is out....save ours eyes for bleeding again pls!!"
tt7871636,"The first movie was not very good either. But if we compare this film, the first movie is a masterpiece. :) I do not recommend"
tt7871636,"It was a disappointment. 2 hours with no social message, no personality, no script and no directing. Why? Why waste so many talents? Creativity was frozen and forgotten. Cinematography was horrible. Actors had no clue what was going on. Looked like they had fun between themselves. But remember, movies are made for movie lovers."
tt7871636,"The script is really careless and bad. This has been made to get money and popularity. We need more clever movies, not this kind of movies!!! Producers think that people have no brain because all the jokes in this movie are rubbish!!!! There is no directing, is like very ordinary series!! Really did not like this movie!"
tt7871636,"There is no question about the misleading score on this movie. Looks like some random people wrote reviews. Watched this movie yesterday in Amsterdam, and boy we enjoyed it. Funny as hell, good acting, good music, nice setting for the whole movie. It's not state of the art, the story is not very deep or has higher meanings to it. But it's just a very good comedy movie, which shows what is valuable in life and enjoy life as it is. The characted Deliha is tremedously well played again. My suggestion: Go watch this movie if you like to laugh, if your a dark gruesome complaing type off human, still go watch and enjoy life for once. By the way, it helps to see this movie in the native language. Some jokes just can't be translated well enough."
tt7871636,I have never seen such an outrageous script.It is also a source of shame for Turkish productions.
tt7871636,"Not even in a funny manner. No humor, bad acting and a foolish script. High raters and reviewers of this movie are ""rigged"" hired guns. Do not fall for this."
tt7871636,". I didnt smile in one scene,not once . totally waste of time"
tt7871636,Waste of time watching this bad comedy. The actress .... I mean .... no!! It is just NoT funny at all. Would not recommend this to anybody
tt7871636,Very dumb humor and not funny at all. Waste of time. Actors are good but script is so badly written.
tt7871636,"Deliha , she doesn't like this calling but i love her , her energy. Gupse Özay who is acting Zeliha very successful actress , actually she is not acting she makes me feel like she is really Zeliha. While watching i laughed so many times and felt the most important things in the world deeply , it is really empose how good with working with joyful team and lt advices us behave whoever we are. We shouldn't be shy because of our personality. Just be yourself ! Thank you Deliha , I love you"
tt7871636,"It is on Netflix (Canada). If you have a Netflix membership, give this movie a try."
tt7871636,"Deliha 2 is a very good sequel, continuing on from the first and not feeling like a rehash. The jokes are also just as good and there weren't many groanworthy, moments to be had. The only real negative I have is how it writes out the previous film's love interest because the actor isn't here for this one. Overall, I was a bit nervous going in that this wouldn't live up to expectations, but it more than met them!"
tt7871636,"Movie is awesome and super motivational. With a sensational and funny story, would definitely recommend."
tt7871636,Scenario is not too deep and surprising but it had really lots of moments making me laugh that is why it is a big 8 :)
tt8723216,"The good: Effective lead actress. Watchable 3rd act.The bad: The 3rd act paid for all the sins of the 1st and 2nd, and that's the most one can say. Movie's a snooze fest, which isn't necessarily bad because slow burn horrors are usually the better ones; but a snooze fest of cliches? You'd lose count of all the movies this one is trying so hard to be. Quite a handful of nightmare scenes, Freddy Krueger would be offended. Japanese horror? We've got you covered. James Wan? Sure thing. A very important school staff meeting to discuss a student's death? Sure, do it in a chapel lit only with candles; because, you know, a school office of some sort is just too unhorror-ish. What else can we put in it? Oh, yeah, make it 1995. There...Eerie. ;)"
tt8723216,"Because it's filled with every horror cliché there is. The first scare is even the good old mirror trick, and it's poorly done.There are some promising scenes where the main protagonist talks to the ghosts, but they all end up as jumpscares. Be prepared that this movie is filled with these nonsensical jumpscares. They are everywhere, it's as if every ghost wants to jumpscare the main protagonist into understanding what's going on, all the time.Was there hype for this movie? I dont get it."
tt8723216,"This movie has a huge problem: it's extremely repetitive. There are many scenes almost identical to each other, the central part of the movie is basically a never ending loop of predictable jump scares.
The plot itself is very basic and the pacing is terrible."
tt8723216,"The movie was extremely disappointing. I had high hopes because of the reviews on social media which turn out to be faked or paid reviews. Bea Alonzo and Charo Santos did their best in delivering their lines. However, the storyline is boring and predictable and even the evil ghost Erika is not scary at all. It looks like a film made to scare kids on the cinema. I have wasted my time and money on this overly hyped movie."
tt8723216,This film had some really spine-tingling scenes and jump-scare techniques wisely used that made this a good horror film. I love how it was very original in using a traditional Filipino Catholic School horror story and turned it into a masterpiece.
tt8723216,"This movie is overrated, unoriginal and really boring. You need to fast-forward through this borefest, no point in watching it.
1/10"
tt8723216,"This movie thought it was redefining a whole genre of typical horror movies involving your Catholuc school, dorms, and our favorite comfort rooms, but it just smacked right into the cliches. Boring, predictable, eerie (where did the title come from? The supposedly suspenseful music that was also cliche?) music that should make you scared, the thunderstorm, the close-ups of saints' statues, the quick shots of ugly monster-like faces. All tricks to make you jump, because actually there's no story behind this. Oh, and adding the journalist? Come on."
tt8723216,Odd cliche-ridden horror flick on a strange Guidance Counsellor who dabbles in the supernatural to help teen girls who are dying one by one in a convent. Starts out slow but picks up in the end. A fine representation of the genre from Southeast Asia.
tt8723216,"It is not a complex or very elaborated movie, it is simple, classic and conventional, but, it has good shots, nice cinematography, interesting plot and a good ending."
tt8723216,"We are doomed! The philippines is doomed! From politicians to its people and its movie makers, we are doomed. A premiere catholic school in the philippines with only 15 students? non linear storytelling that doesn't make any sense at all. The director tries so hard to be Nolan but ends up being shyamalan. Philippines is destined to be doomed!"
tt8723216,"It was a pretty solid film. Don't watch this film expecting scary looking monsters or gore and violence. It's full of clichés, yes, but they're all effective. The best aspect of this film is the atmosphere. I can understand why people thought it was boring but for me it was extremely tense. Overall, the film's not the best but it's definitely not as bad as what the other reviews are trying to say it is."
tt8723216,"It was in my watchlist and now I got the time to watch it, i felt like i've wasted it. An hour and so of disappointment. I heard about a lot of good reviews in social media and said to myself, why not. Should've checked IMDB first. -_-"
tt8723216,"Notice I used breakthrough in Philippine Cinema. The formula used by Mikhail Red (who is very young and promising at 28/29 btw), is something we've seen before in some other movies. But he delivered.The first scenes were a huge turn-off. Because of course, one girl has to go to the comfort room ALONE. Then for some reason (probably had a black out OF ALL DAYS), its dark. Because it has to. And the windows HAVE to be opened so the curtains will fly and make room for a windy atmosphere. Uh-huh. Why oh why can't horror take place in a well-illuminated place???? With a lot of people. At daytime. Haha! At some point, dark atmosphere works against the essence of the film because I can't see the ghost anymore hehe.Another huge turn off. The overused scene of one picking up a pen that has fallen on the floor then seeing feet on the other side of the table.A lot of decent jumpscares here. Decent sound effects too. Again, I applaud Mikhail for setting the bar high.We've seen this all before. The story. The style used by the director. BUT what I find in this movie being a breakthrough is it does create an eerie atmosphere, showing that Philippine horror has evolved. Of course, gone were the days of long-haired pale-skinned ghosts crawling out of the TV. Its time to open the floodgates for themes that may well come under sacrilege, in a country of Catholics. Though, to be fair, there's no sacrilege here as the only religious element involved is the fact that the school is ran by nuns and one of the main (mysterious) characters is a nun. One thing why this movie also did well in the box office and in the critics is for the longest time since Seklusyon (I think), a horror film, that could actually be called a decent horror film, was offered to the masses. Because you know what sells so much like hotcakes here? Infidelity stories! Yeah man, who wants to solve the mystery of the crying lady in the CR anyway when its so much fun seeing the wife pull the mistress by the hair??Pat (Bea Alonzo) is a guidance counselor in Sta. Lucia Academy, an all-girls school ran by nuns. The atmosphere becomes weird when a student, Erika, commits suicide. Pat encounters visions of Erika and talks to her. Soon, another girl gets killed. Or was she? Pat tries to solve the mystery behind the killings in the school (and the role that the school's head, Sister Alice (Charo Santos has to play), including that of another girl who tries to commit suicide. Everything is not new to the eyes. The ending part was well-made, no mind-bending twists here. The movie was consistent from start to finish.Now what is truly remarkable about this is the promise of potential from the director, Mikhail Red. Note that he is only 28 or 29...And seeing Eerie, I would've thought this was made by an old-timer. The young man knows what he's doing."
tt8723216,"I wanted to smash my head upon the monitor.
.
.
.
.
.
."
tt8723216,"OK so I read a few reviews on this movie about people unable to sleep and can watch it with he light's off and I said sounds good let give it a try. In one word terrible, This series relies on music to make you jump and quick shots of something running. The story is poor the scare factor even more so. I would not bother watching this."
tt8723216,Why the hell a Guidance Councillor stay at the school till pass midnight.
tt8723216,"Different and fresh. This movie is not like your typical Pinoy horror. I rarely watch Filipino films because of the usual tropes and clichés. But this one definitely changed my mind. Mikhail Red's vision is a little bit sacriligious but not far from the truth. It doesn't rely too much on the jumpscares but will instead give you an ""eerie"" feeling. Great storytelling and cinematography. The musical score needs to be mentioned too. They definitely gave justice to the title!"
tt8723216,"And the title ""eerie"" is on point with the tone set throughout the movie, but that's pretty much it of what's good. The jump-scares are just dumb, the story is boring and uninteresting, nothing about them are worthy enough to spent your hours on."
tt8723216,"My boyfriend fell asleep watching this movie. Though the story is just average - acting was really above the average. Eerie yet I was expecting an unpredictable story. But indeed, one of the scariest horror movie of the Filipino movie industry!"
tt8723216,"A rather poorly written film with neither a proper story nor a ponderable theme. Film is peppered with a number of filler scenes designed solely to jump-scare viewers. 15-20 min of film's length could be shortened if these meaningless scenes are removed. Decision-making of characters is led, not by any thought process, but director's/writer's immature ambition to maximize opportunities to startle viewers. Cinematography and background score, however, made a good impression on me. The film owes much to these two departments in creating its suspenseful environment which is quite decent. I also can't fathom film's fascination with restrooms. All the critical events in the story take place in a students' restroom. Crimes are committed in the restroom. Students bully each other in the restroom. Someone commits suicide in the same restroom. Someone wanting to hide goes into that same restroom. Unimaginative and childish. Finally, film's end makes no sense at all and is as meaningless as the rest of it. Fitting.AVOID.(Watched on Netflix in HD/5.1 surround sound)"
tt8723216,"Let me first start off by saying the movie was filmed and directed very well. All of the actors did a fine job and the effects were fine. Now the bad, the writing was just not up to snuff and the movie suffered for it. The 3 main plot twists you could see a mile away and the ending was not merely hinted at but pretty much spoiled halfway through the movie. No spoilers so just trust me you wont be shocked or surprised. The scares were very limited as well and depended almost entirely on the dark setting of the school for chills. If not for the fine performances by just about the entire case, save for the late addition of the detective who looked like he should be in a boy band, the movie would not be worth even a rental. Can not recommend a movie ticket but might be worth a stream on a cold dark night."
tt8723216,"Am I missing something?
I got bored and after30 mins, I decided to read the reviews ( which I normally I don't do it since I don't like to spoil my interest ). The reviews was positive . So I thought I should watch it a bit more.
Wrong. I should have just stop. It's not just boring. But very boring. Torture."
tt7587604,"I see why it's a low score, namely due to the lack of ending.It is expected to continue as there are so many characters in play and to be developed.Instead calling it a movie, they should call it Netflix series as it would be more suiting."
tt7587604,The best part of this movie is its visuals (especially the landscapes) and special effects. It brought me back to my childhood playing the video games. The plot is a bit loose and the writing can be cheesy but it left me wanting more.
tt7587604,The fight scenes are just as crazy as the.video game series and brought back great memories!The story is solid - has to be as the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is considered a national treasure in China and has been told and retold for hundred years.Overall I enjoyed the visual effects and storytelling.
tt7587604,"I am not usually interested in this type of film, but this is unexpectedly good. The plot is engaging, and kept me interested throughout. The scenery is beautiful, and the production is pretty good too. I enjoyed it."
tt7587604,Terrible but I couldn't stop watching and laughing. If I hadn't played the game a lot when I was younger I think I would've switched it off almost immediately.
tt7587604,"Didnt play the game so coming from a movie perspective the story is all over the place, amateur CGI, not even the huge amount of top notch hong kong veteran actors are able to save this mess. P.s the english dubbing on netflix is a nightmare/insult to asians."
tt7587604,What in the hell is this??? I mean i was actually left speechless at the utter bullcrap of a movie this is.
tt7587604,"I have a feeling many of the bad reviews are from people that never played the game and were expecting a quality oscar winning movie. Or they played the game and someone had the same view that the movie would be some masterpiece. The movie is a PEFFECT match of what the game is. Fun, unadulterated action. It has many of the characters from the game, some of the weapons...etc. The movie is in now way mind blowing, deep and oscar worthy. Heck even most of the subtitles don't even match what the charecters are saying (if you decide to watch it in english with english subs). But I enjoyed the sillyness of the movie and over the top action."
tt7587604,"I enjoy the Dynasty Warriors games, and I was hoping this movie would be just as over-the-top and silly. I was not disappointed!This is silly, and cheesey, and the effects are purposefully laughable, and it was pretty much like watching one of the games.I think it was well-cast, and everyone had just the right amount of melodrama and seriousness in their performances.No, it's not a historical piece. No, it's not some serious drama-action like Hero. No, it's probably not even that good. But it IS very entertaining and a riot, and puts a smile on your face if you let it."
tt7587604,"The story wasn't bad. The acting wasn't terrible, and the music and setting were fantastic. The problem here is that they took a highly unrealistic Magic approach that amounted to more of a Dragon ball: Evolution than a Chinese War Epic. The video game was fantastic. It used magic to represent the immense talent of these legendary historical figures. However just because that approach worked well in a game doesn't mean it would in a movie. It COULD, with the right budget, but sadly it didn't here and rather than demonstrating the heroes talent with a blade they had then flinging fireballs and flailing weapons around in extremely unrealistic and silly ways that detracted from the historical plot.A fair to mediocre effort ultimately ruined by bad CG and corny directing."
tt7587604,"This film just hit me at the heart,
The years I've played this game for made made me love the film more.The characters,
The areas they fight,
The moves they use,.....
And Lu BuThe film is 10/10 for gamers like myself!!But I fear the negative reviews for this film for those that don't understand the way the film is ""over dramatic"" and ""corny"" .IS THE WAY THE GAME WASSo 10/10 from me from a game to a film 👍🏻"
tt7587604,"Dynasty Warriors is a Hong Kong-produced video game film adaptation that never finds a firm tone and flip-flops between being unintentionally funny and tacky. Armed with its big cast and visually stunning CGI action scenes, it plays like a string of video game cut scenes jam-packed with a lot of ham and a lot of cheese. It's a mess but a fun entertaining mess.Director Roy Chow Hin Yeung and his wife screenwriter Christine To Chi Long take an uber literal approach in adapting a video game. The heroes in Dynasty Warriors are demi-gods walking amongst humans with special abilities. When they fight, energy crackles around them. Like in any hack-and-slash game, every hero has special moves where they can hit soldiers into the air and then unleash a lethal combo. Wide shots of the armies gearing up for battle look like a screencap of a real-time strategy war game.From beginning to end, I honestly couldn't tell if Dynasty Warriors was ever in full control of its tone. At times, it's laugh-out-loud hilarious. Lam Suet's General Dong Zhuo's costume, decked out in a gold and black garb and darkened skin, looks too much like Judge Pao for it to be a coincidence. Phillip Keung cameos as General Zhang Jiao and performs it as a shaman dressed like Big Bird from Sesame Street.At other times, the story gets dramatic when it tells the origin of Cao Cao, who is played by Mainland actor Wang Kai in the film's most scene-stealing performance. Wang Kai plays Cao Cao as a proud scheming lonely visionary who wants to fix the world in his own way, providing a much-required gravitas to the film's scattered canvas. Tony Yang's Liu Bei, the other MVP, delivers a nuanced performance and creates a fascinating dynamic with Wang Kai. The scenes between Cao Cao and Liu Bei, who are shown as two sides of the same coin, are my favorite moments. At times, it feels like they're in a completely different movie.The rest of the cast is all over the place. Louis Koo hams it up as Lü Bu in a performance completely dialed by eye glares and ends up coming off as a bland villain. Han Geng's Guan Yu and Justin Cheung's Zhang Fei are unfortunately compromised by poor costuming and make-up that reduces them to be cosplayers. The eye shadow and the black powder that darkens their skin look too obvious, especially when they're standing next to Louis Koo, the Lord of the Skin Tan.It was fascinating how all the Three Kingdom heroes are portrayed to the level of mythic Olympian gods. There are many aerial drone shots of the heroes perpetually standing on mountain tops overlooking mankind while they converse about worldly matters. They go everywhere holding their hundred-pound weapons and never tire. They all admire each other and casually engage in friendly matches on steep cliffs while discussing their life philosophies.Due to the jarring tone, the dramatic seriousness comes off more like deadpan comedy, like the actors are holding these beats for a dry laugh in what seems more like a parody of wuxia films. The main issue I had with Dynasty Warriors was I never knew whether the film was being funny or serious. If it is supposed to be serious, then it's a miscalculated mess. If it is funny, then director Roy Chow Hin-Yeung has failed to put in the irony. It seems like he wanted both and got lost in the mix.That said, I chose funny every time. My wife and I laughed through Dynasty Warriors while roasting it in a full-fledged Mystery Science Theater experience. There's no way to watch Dynasty Warriors seriously. Anyone who's critiquing this film in historical or literary terms can just save their breath. I just enjoyed it in a Sharknado type way.I could even see myself rewatching Dynasty Warriors with guy friends over beers, laughing and making fun of it along the way. At its 300 million RMB budget, I doubt that was the filmmakers' intention. It seemed like there were higher hopes."
tt7587604,"First of all, I want to point out that the costumes are great. They are very detailed and beautiful to look at. The music is great, although I hoped for more epic battle music like in the games. The actors are great too, they looked like as if they stepped out of the tv from the dynasty warriors games. But the CGI... the CGI is so bad in this movie that it started to make me laugh. It kinda ruined and saved the movie at the same time. At last I want to talk about the female warriors. I used to play dynasty warriors all the time with my brother. I played as all the female warriors, they were so badass and so cool. So you can say I was very disappointed to see none of them back in the movie. The women in this movie were portrayed as weak and as entertainment for men. Very disappointing. ."
tt7587604,"I watching a lot version of Three Kingdom movie and series, i play the game, read the novel. I love it all except this one (Dinasty Warrior 2021).Guan Yu are so skinny and no authority, Cao Cao like teeneger, all cast looks bad.I believe the directer never read The Three Kingdom novel but like to play the game only, thats why the story is so weak.The magic scenes looks like Disney version and the fighing equal with Bollywood."
tt7587604,"Dont get the low reviews,this is way better than mulan that's for sure. Captured the games perfectly."
tt7587604,There is no proper reason to end the movie. The script is so badly written that you never come to know why the scene is ended and why there is fuss of action. The battle scenes are like video games. There is no logic and it is laughable. I think the director made for visual effects which are horrible even kids cannot these visual scenes.
tt7587604,"Honestly I'm quite disappointed with the cultivation of this film. But apart from that, this film for me is enough to cure my longing for this game made by developer omega force. MAKE IT SEQUAL!!! AND MAKE IT BETTER!!!"
tt7587604,"I heard everyone said how bad this movie is. I disagree. I am a Dynasty Warriors fan and I'm loving this. The casting is a bit questionable, but it works. They really had the costume and weapon to stay true to the game. Don't expect this movie to be realistic, because it's NOT meant to be. This movie is based on a Musou game, of course they had Musou attacks and whatnot. We're here to see things like 1 general vs 1000 troops, and they DELIVERED.The CGI is average as this isn't Hollywood, so keep that in mind. I personally think that they did a good job with the CGI with what they have.Feminist, don't come with the ""there's no women"" or ""women is a plaything in this movie"". PLEASE KEEP THIS IN MIND: The story is based on history, and women back then has no power or whatsoever. Yes, I know there are female warriors in Musou game, but there are no notable ones in the Yellow Turban era other than Diao Chan.Don't get me started on the music. THE MUSIC IS GOOD. Another point for staying true to the game.Overall, this movie is great. I want more. The first part here is the Yellow Turban and Dong Zhuo's era, like how any Dynasty Warrriors game starts in Story Mode. Hopefully they'll make more focusing on the aftermath of Dong Zhuo's era and into the actual Three Kingdoms."
tt7587604,"If you grew up with kung fu movies and series, you would know that these are the Chinese superheroes. Kung fu defies gravity, and the honor of men revolve around the virtues and vices embodied in The Art Of War, involving either or the combination of loyalty, courage, cunning, spokesmanship, military strategy, etc. Homage is paid to the games, so we also get the weapons, stategies, and magic from the games, and being very very loosely tied to history.Any Chinese can tell you the military rivalry in this time period between Liu Bei and Cao Cao is so famous, hotly debated, and has reached a romanticized status, much Western battles of Troy or Sparta and so on. This movie seems to illustrate only their start, and more installations will hopefully follow.There is a lot to fit in, so it does feel a little unfocused at times. The special effects are very ""cheesy"" as blockbuster Chinese movies can be. And of course, those not familiar with the famous games will not be able to appreciate as much... not through their fault, but due to the plot design... but who can really introduce Chinese Game of Thrones in a short movie, right?"
tt7587604,"If you are familiar with the game , or the Chinese history, this is not your cup of tea. And where is Xing Cai ?"
tt8716800,The English voice actors they used to dub this are terrible. The kind of dubbing that gives dubbing its bad reputation.The only reason I didn't give this one star was that my 9 year old daughter enjoyed watching it.
tt8716800,"Probably not, but I watched this with a group of about 10 other teenage girls to laugh at it and it was entertaining. The drama is pretty fun to watch as the evil step-mom is just the most evil chick ever and there are puppies! Also Rafa is a sweet baby.In a bit of a twist, one of the step sisters gets a redemption arch and Cinderela's Still better than the main couple, where were pretty average and unoffensive if you don't count when the dude got mad at the main girl (you can tell I'm bad with names) for no reason toward the end and then almost immediately had to apologize. Also on a similar note, the main chick's aunt was pretty misandrist for no reason and her slam poetry was hilarious garbage, although I'm certain that was the intention. Still, it was funny.I see other people here complaining about the dubs, probably not realizing that this was originally in Brazilian Portuguese so... yeah the dub is not going to match their lips. The dub is actually fine though, but keep in mind that on Netflix if you turn on the subtitles and the dub at the same time, they'll be similar but not the same due to how those things are made.As a person who just loves to sit down and watch some teen drama trash, it was fun, especially with a crowd. Or if you're here wondering about if your kid should watch it (the target audience) then sure why not. Yeah my review is 2 stars, but low quality doesn't always mean low entertainment, especially if you're just trying to entertain some kids for an evening."
tt8716800,"Movie was very boring, acting was horrible. Also the words that were said in the movies did not match up to the persons mouth when they were talking. Through out the whole movie it was like that which made it very horrible and hard for me to watch. You guys need to improve acting and graphic."
tt8716800,"All acting is terrible, the plot is worse than the original cinderela, but if you are with your girlfriend and she is on her period, this is the best movie pssible. It's very funny to watch high too."
tt8716800,I couldn't watch more than 20 min of it. I ended up turning subtitles on and turned the volume all the way down. I understand its from a different country but dubbs are usually made to fit not just placed onto the scenes. You can tell that it is dubbed from the beginning. I wouldn't recommend this movie.
tt8716800,An enjoyable teen love story movie. My daughter loved it so i think it goes more than the usual teen pop movie. It has teen appeal. Storyline could have been better but definitely something fun.
tt8716800,"I'm not sure why the movie industry likes to adapt the Cinderella tale to music-oriented storylines, but this is probably my favorite movie of this trend.While some characters could've been casted better, i found reactions to be pretty genuine. Additionally, this movie didnt have me facepalming over how the ""prince"" couldn't tell it was her. He was an intelligent character who could be 100% forgiven for not figuring it out sooner.This movie also explores more than just cinderella's love and believing in her musically-inclined abilities, but also the nature of valuing relationships and of self-love with other characters."
tt8716800,"Before you watch the movie, use the subtitles because the dubbed English is horrible. This movie is a great take on the story of Cinderella. It's has it's moments for sure -yes some of the acting is a little over the top at times- but it has good morals about not compromising who you are or your dreams for a man. Plus the soundtrack is banging too."
tt8716800,Seeing a lot of people saying the dubbing was bad. Turn it off! Just read the subtitles and listen to the original Portuguese. A cute movie for teenagers. Beautiful clothes and locations.
tt8716800,"I doubted if I will like the movie after seeing such a low rating, but it was actually good. Even though some of the characters were over-acting, the characters were generally believeables and the story as intriguing as it could be (when we all know how it will end, obviously) . I watched it with subtitles, so can't say anything about English dubbing.I would place this movie second after ""another Cindirella Story"" in the list of ""modern teenage remakes"". A very strong 8/10"
tt8716800,The characters are believable and unique. The story is different from the classics and I love it for that. The music is great and the acting is flowless. Nothing more to say.
tt8716800,This movie was the weirdest movie I have ever seen. The translation from Spanish to English was way to literal and the dubbing was weird. If you are bored and want to laugh watch this movie on Netflix.
tt9257484,"Rattlesnake was not the worst movie Netflix has attached their name to yet. This movie is definitely one to add to your list and watch when you simply can't find anything else interesting to watch. The acting is weak, the script is boring and the movie is lonnngggg! Oh wait, it's not! It is only an hour and a half long - but feels like 2 and a half.It had a lot of potential but failed. It did you get thinking about many different scenarios, outcomes, questions in general. It doesn't however give you a final answer - nor does it really try to make you wonder if she's not right in the head, is the town cursed, was she seeing things, could this be legit, did the daughter actually get bit? Nothing! It just sort of ends...Worth a watch if you're bored - but there's plenty of movies to waste your time on that are much better than this one."
tt9257484,"I liked the idea, and it could've been good. I thought the main character took too long to act. For the situation she was in, I'd expect more urgency. Not enough suspense was created. I am disappointed. Very anticlimactic."
tt9257484,"Can't say I had exactly high hopes for this, but it's even more disappointing coming from the director whose previous movie (also a Netflix original) was the decent and effortful ""1922"". ""Rattlesnake"" knows exactly what it is, but it doesn't try to excel at it at all.For the most part ""Rattlesnake"" feels like an uninspiring slow-burn, a familiar tale of a familiar dilemma explored only vaguely as if the filmmakers behind this were uninvested and half asleep. You know when you start cleaning up your room but give up halfway through? That's how ""Rattlesnake"" felt like. Some of the qualities include a good main performance by Carmen Ejogo (who tries her best while portraying a character in search of any real personality), a story that holds potential (but instead chooses the uninventive, watered down approach) arguably good cinematography (which kinda wears down with time by just not changing, impressing, surprising) & an original score that goes from seemingly effective to either repetitive or feeling like it's been wasted on this movie. Both the script and the direction is bland and comes off as simply not very smart. The pacing's very even throughout and also very slow, it doesn't quite pick up at the end either.I believe ""Rattlesnake"" is a fine friday flick, but I can't put this anywhere above average, because in the end it feels more like just another filler for the mass market of movies on digital media than it feels like a sophisticated, well crafted and entertaining thriller/horror movie. My rating: 5/10."
tt9257484,"Unfortunately not very good as a movie. These Netflix originals are really hit or miss stuff and I think I can see a pattern already. In many cases they are something that would work better as an episode of an anthology series and don't really benefit from movie length. There simply isn't enough substance to carry a full movie.We have a mother and a child who for whatever reason are moving by car and decide to take a short cut through a small desert road. Tyre goes flat and a rattlesnake bites the kid while the mother is changing the tyre. Mysteriously a trailer appears nearby where they go to seek help (cell phone naturally does not work). Kid is cured, but the cure comes with a price that puts the mother in a difficult situation. While kind of interesting setup, there is zero beef to the story, nothing is explained or based on anything. And this is often the case with these ""direct-to-Netflix"" movies, things just happen. When there is no story to base the plot on, it's not very interesting. Just so many why's .. And the ending is fittingly unsatisfying.The direction - while not exactly bad - definitely does not add any artistic value to the movie. A movie either needs to be artistically interesting or tell a proper story, this one did neither. Why a rattlesnake? Who was the lady? What was the movie all about? Is there some folklore about a rattlesnake bite and cure that I as a European don't know? I mean the movie is even titled ""Rattlesnake"" and not ""The Curse of The Desert Lady"", which it probably would have been called had it been made in the 50s. It kind of has the same b-movie quality to it.The acting is ranging from ok (Ejogo) to bad (Rossi)."
tt9257484,"A lot of low budget horror movies end up just like RATTLESNAKE. They stretch the story and the viewer's patience as best they can to reach that full feature length when they really should have remained a leaner 30-minute short in a horror anthology of sorts. There's a pretty good set-up that winds up spinning its wheels for 50 minutes or so until it reaches its underwhelming finale. You barely get to know the main characters or the evil behind the driving force of the story.
Hildiitch's adaptation of SK's 1922 for Netflix got a boost from an almost unrecognizable Thomas Jane in the lead. Ejogo's performance feels, for lack of a better work, lacking. While I didn't hate what I was viewing, I sure didn't like checking my watch every 5 minutes either."
tt9257484,"I'm not sure why Netflix decided to pick up (and make a Netflix exclusive) this low budget thriller. It's not a terrible effort, but I could see much more wasted potential than what the movie actually grabbed on and used. It gets to an okay start, having a little atmosphere and not taking too long to set up the situation the female heroine finds herself in. However, after that point, the movie quickly gets bogged down. Though the heroine is racing against time, I couldn't get that feeling at all - there is no feeling of tension or speed, and the heroine seems to be taking the situation more calmly than I think anyone else in her shoes would be feeling. The situation also feels too stretched out for its own good, even though the movie only has a running time of 85 minutes. As for the ending, I won't spoil what happens in the climax or conclusion, but I will say that I had a strong feeling of dissatisfaction from these final few minutes; there are a number of unanswered questions as well as future potential problems for the heroine that simply are not resolved. I guessed the movie is fairly well produced for its very low budget, but I would have accepted a less slick look for a stronger atmosphere and more suspense."
tt9257484,"Its not bad.
Decently paced thriller keeps you watching as there's so many variations of what could happen next it keeps you guessing. Atmosphere is pretty good and the lead actress does a good job. Don't get me wrong there is no Oscar winners here but for an hour and a half at home with your feet up it will keep you entertained."
tt9257484,"Rattlesnake has a great concept. A women gets a puncture and while fixing it her daughter gets bitten by a rattlesnake. Suddenly a trailer appeared and a women cures the bite and says she will talk about payment later. Payment it turns out is she must replace her life with the life of another or her daughter will die as payment has not been met.So the concept is great, any artform which makes you think what would I do and helps you empathise with the characters is usually on to s winner but that's where it starts to be let down. It's right here where some amazing philosophical debates could start to begin. Could you find someone evil and feel ok about killing them when there is an opportunity that this person could change in the future and positively impact others? Is it right you should take the life of another when fatalists and people of religion may say you are going against god's plan. Or is it ok to take the life of someone seriously ill when there may be opportunity of miraculous recovery you are taking away. All these a brilliant film would make but it doesn't explore or question the situation at all, there is only acceptense. It's a shame really, opportunity lost."
tt9257484,"A mother with her little daughter stuck on a Texus wasteland, the kid gets bitten by a rattlesnake, the mother gets her cured by a stranger - but the payment of the cure is what the movie is all about.The story is innovative, but somewhere in execution it gets lost in translation. You can feel the director is slowly drifting away from the primary focus (which should have been about the core mystery) and concentrating more other trivial stuff. Showing the leading lady's dilemma is fine, but too much of that diluted the actual interest.And in the end, you will feel somewhat disappointed on how much better this could have been."
tt9257484,"Dull, lackluster. The ending is underwhelming. This is a movie to watch when you're extremely bored with nothing better to watch."
tt9257484,"Why so grouchy, fellow reviewers? It might help to think of Rattlesnake not as a horror film, but as a folktale, told in rich detail in a slow drawl. I've watched it three times, it's become a kind of ritual for me: the heat-saturated cinematography, the series of quick-sketched minor characters (check out the gun salesman, and the creepy husband who Keeps Her In Her Place), and the beautiful logic of the climax- the desperate mother must kill to save her daughter, but in killing must lose her soul, or at least our sympathy: the solution to that conundrum is brilliant, and elegantly brings the tale full circle. Of all the movies lately that are shot in the desert to save money, this one is my favorite."
tt9257484,"The beginning is so strong the rest might come off as a bit of weak. But that would be a disservice to the movie - if you actually thought that way. It looks good and the acting is good too. The story seems complicated at first, but is quite easy to follow.Depending on what you expect, you'll either be satisfied or might be dissapointed a bit. There is enough horror, there is enough drama though and a central question that might haunt you. The suspension works and even if you don't like where it's heading it keeps up until the end ..."
tt9257484,"It could have been better if we weren't subjected to watch every single little movement. Near the end, when she was climbing down in the canyon, it took forever. Perhaps suspenseful music would have helped. I kept skipping ahead starting at 20 minutes in. Nearly every frame was a closeup of the main character's face."
tt9257484,"Short SPOIL FREE review:This movie was excruciatingly boring. Watching paint dry on a wall was more entertaining. Also I've watched the movie is less than 25 minutes. I skipped and skipped like a racehorse.Seriously folks just read the following and try to think critically for a moment:There are amazing movie scripts out there, amazingly talented individuals who would do anything to make a movie with passion and dedication.. How on earth does Netflix fund and green light these kind of movies?This is making me seriously consider changing from streaming service.. I've seen a couple more of these kind of projects and it's offensive, do they think we're stupid?Seriously, I beg not see these kind of boring, low budget, meaningless movies... If that is their objective, then please make a map with a name 'budget friendly movies', that's the stuff I'll be avoiding at all times. Those who love that kind of stuff, can have it...I guess it's now a battle of having more instead having better movies... Quantity above quality."
tt9257484,"Not bad ! Cool story, nice lead actress ...
BUT It's not very suspenseful and thrilling ! In some way it's a bit boring."
tt9257484,"This movie was all over the place, but entertaining? I guess."
tt9257484,"I have lived in Texas for 5 years. Texas has a nice atmosphere for horror movies. It has all the ingredients: long lonely roads, weird landscape, weird folks, I say it in a nice way. This movie is not bad per se but It is hard to believe that they - the producers - missed it so badly. The plot could have been better worked on. The reason the lady got in trouble made no sense, what triggered the whole thing was not really making sense. But it is not a waste of time, it is just not as good."
tt9257484,"I saw someone mention that this would've been great as a 15 ish minute short. I agree. It could've also worked as a series being of the ""Devils"" POV.It started off REALLY interesting and I give it 10/10 for POTENTIAL!However...after you know what's going on, it really falls apart totally...it felt so flat and generic once it got the story going. It basically goes exactly as you'd expect ...no twist, no real good characters...and the plot becomes just...boring. I wanted to like this so bad...because I want to support horror films made with quality...it's shot fine, no issues...but it's just...nothing?? A series would've given them time to flesh things out...but yeah. Not the worst but you'll miss nothing if you skip it...sadly...the 4/10 is only due to the set up, which I enjoyed. Also, the little kid was VERY cute."
tt9257484,"This film had an awesome set up and premise. I was so sure it was going to be great but it fell just short of what it could have been. It's not bad at all. Still a decent watch. But I hate when you have such a great concept and don't execute it as good as it could be done. Everything was already in place. All the writer needed to do was raise the stakes some more. Give this a secondary storyline or subplot. It was just a straight forward story which made it lag sometimes. It needed just something a little extra to make it feel more whole. And it was kind of predictable. It's a shame, they were sooooo close. Still, it's decent watch."
tt9257484,"Predictable. Slow. Boring.The only good thing I have to say about Rattlesnake is that it managed to occupy its entire run time, one of 1h 25minutes, including the intro and the credits, but other than that, seriously, you could anticipate everything that was going to happen here from min 25 mostly.I wish I could recommend this, but it is slow, boring and genuinely doesn't show anything, close to literally no action, everything is put there from the very beginning and it is quite clear where it's heading. I guess you could give it a go but try and expect nothing from it. Cause it will certainly fail to deliver.Cheers!"
tt9257484,"Ok its not 10/10 movie, but the acting is solid, makes you wonder whats going on the whole time, defiantly not 4.6 movie - just makes me wonder who's agenda is in play here. its sure a well done movie although its not something new you never watched. just watch it, don't listen to haters."
tt9257484,"This movie definitely doesn't deserve such a poor rating. However, I agree with some of the other comments that the stakes weren't high enough. The person she chose was truly awful, so there's not really a moral dilemma there. What about if she had to kill three people? Then a greater dilemma is introduced: is the life of a child worth 3 lives? How about if she had to kill another child in order for the sacrifice to be equivalent? Good movie, but could've been great."
tt9257484,I've sat through a lot worse. Movie really didn't go anywhere. Was decent background noise with minimal story line. I guess if you can't find anything else to watch give it a shot.
tt9257484,"I'm starting to notice a pattern in those Netflix movies :A pitch, simple and intriguingSome mysterious, surnatural force that will never be explainedA main protagonist who drives the story by its sheer stupidityDragging scenes that makes a 90mn movie feel like 3 hoursNetflix movies are always the same. They're like a push-up bra. You want to see what's behind it, but in the end, you're always disappointed."
tt9257484,"Don't watch this bad movie, it leaves many questions and there's too many plot holes"
tt8510324,This movie is made for money only. Quoted from Good Game.
tt8510324,If you're interested in League of Legends you'll be disappointed because you'll barely see the game behind all the irrelevant drama. It is a complete waste of time unless you want to see two hours long product placement. In fact tickets should've been free in theaters considering the number of those ads. 1/10.

tt8510324,I would like to congratulate the world's first espor film
tt8510324,"Nicely written, elegantly directed. Especially the casting is very good. Performance, friendship, bonding, self-improvement themes expected from a sports movie are being processed successfully. Someone who has never played LoL and a hardcore gamer can both enjoy the movie."
tt8510324,This is the first league of legends licensed movie so it should be good ASF
tt10023024,Would have loved the movie if actors who could perform the intense emotional scenes were cast instead. The story from the 90s was shown beautifully.
tt10023024,Love aaj kal is not a nice movie at all. The 1st half is good but after the 1st half u will cant handle it at all. The timings of the songs are really awesome and that's the only plus point in the whole movie. Kartik Aryan acted really well. The story of Randeep Hooda is better than the story of the real movie..peace..
tt10023024,"LOVE AAJ KAL REVIEW :-Love Aaj Kal released in 2009 was a Box Office Hit and had some popular songs to remember. Imtiaz Ali was having a good time then but his recent movies haven't been that much succesful. So, rather than a fresh project he comes back with a similar film Love Aaj Kal to recall 2009 film but with new exciting pair of Kartik Aaryan and Sara Ali Khan. Imtiaz goes intense again and improves a lot from his last outing Jab Harry Met Sejal, but is it really enough? That's the question.Spanning from 1990 to 2020, the movie portrays two love stories from widely different eras facing widely different obstacles. One couple battles society's restrictions while the other must learn to balance work with love, but both portray the same true and unfiltered feelings of love. There can't be much bashing over it's basic writing and screenplay but somehow the inner soul wasn't explored fully. We have witnessed such similar stories so many times before so there's nothing much unique.Coming to the acting department, which i felt was convincing enough. Kartik Aaryan gets 2 completely different roles to showcase his acting skills and does pretty much well with his variations. Sara Ali Khan as Zoe stands out as Best among the cast and this is without a doubt her best performance till date. Randeep Hooda doesn't get much variations compared to Kartik hence the impact is average. Aarushi Sharma as Leena is fantastic. Her dancing moves and expression looks so real and non rehearsed. Rest of the supporting cast of the film is decent.Now let's move towards the technical fields like Cinematography, Background score, editing etc. Camera work is largely artificial because the same places coming again and again on screen, expect climax portion which captured Himalaya beautifully. Background score is healthy whereas editing lacks the intelligence. Lyrics by Irshaad Kamil and Music by Pritam are perfectly suitable to the theme and are one of the finest aspects of Love Aaj Kal. We miss chartbusters like 2009 film, though songs are Hit enough.Now it seems like the obsession of telling complex stories will never get away from director Imtiaz Ali's mind. When you are going to end your story on typical, predictable note then why do you need that intellectual cinema style like western countries? Indian audience have showered so much love to convincing, local love stories and the European sagas were quite depressing for them. Imtiaz Ali should have thought about this and made Love Aaj Kal a simple love story with this new exciting pair called 'Sartik'.Overall, Love Aaj Kal has some likeable things, good songs, fantastic performance but it also has below average direction, less conviction, regular love story theme etc. counting on negative side. This film can be watched for the performances, songs and love story of two different generations. If you have such limited expectations then Love Aaj Kal shoud be there in your watchlist. As we know it's Valentine's Day, i am sure couple are going to love this.Rating- 5/10*"
tt10023024,"It's a toruture of 2 hours 20 minutes.Worst storyline, Same concept as first one. First love aaj kal was far more better than this. Weak storyline, Poor Screenplay, Bad Acting, average music. Kartik's acting is too bad to handle. Sara Ali Khan is worst in her emotional scenes. Average acting of sara. Only Randeep Hudda's acting is watching. Guys please don't waste your money. It is a total waste of money. Please don't go 🙏🙏."
tt10023024,"Disappointing ! Most disgusting movie I have ever seen.
Totally waste of money.
Kartik Aryan and Sara Ali Khan both are Overacting king and queen.
No story
Bad screenplay
Worst direction
Bad dialogues.
Don't watch very bad movie"
tt10023024,"Most overated movie I have ever seen.
One word - Disaster
Skip it , I promise I will never spend money on Imtiaz Ali 's movie.
What a Torture ."
tt10023024,#LoveAajKalReview Kartik Aaryan after Sonu k titu ki sweety is giving back to back flop movies.. His choices are AWFUL.. It's like Kartik Aaryan's life is zero without luv ranjan.. Imtiaz Ali has lost it and he is the king of boredom amongst directors.. he should retire.. save your money or else donate it to a army fund.. sit at home and enjoy watching TV!!
tt10023024,"Love Aaj Kal 2 Review by Nitin Atmaram Sisode :-
Zoe is a confounded character, who has a five-year intend to make cheerful life and have her own organization, before she settles in a serious relationship. While Sara Ali Khan is the correct age to play Zoe, she misses the mark concerning convincingly pulling off the multifaceted nature of her torch and furiously free character. Sara has an overwhelming screen looks and seems flawless, yet her exhibition doesn't exactly make you pull for Zoe. Kartik Aaryan is acceptable as the innocent Raghu, whose change from a meek lovelorn little towner to a major city Casanova, is reasonable. Even Kartik doesn't find a workable pace than compliantly chase after a mind-blowing love and be available to her no matter what. Randeep Hooda leaves an enduring impression even with lesser screen time. Wearing a handlebar mustache and fresh cloth shirts, the underestimated on-screen character looks very spruce. He is very similar to Rishi Kapoor's character in the first. It is his story that is unmistakably all the more fascinating, relatable and engaging. Ali utilizes clear tones and excellent sceneries to reproduce Raghu's love story with Leena played by debutante Arushi Sharma, who conveys viably. The flashback story is intruded on too often to oblige the film's non-straight account. While the film's sincerely story is easygoing in its methodology, there are scarcely any light minutes.Love Aaj Kal decides to praise complex characters and useless connections, with the widespread feeling of love at its center. It makes some passionate minutes en route, yet doesn't exactly leave you hypnotized. The short runtime is another in addition to with a fascinating first-half, however an anticipated second-half. The film's soundtrack is good in tune that enhances the narrating. Ali makes it significant by indicating us the differentiation between customary community love that was straightforward yet troublesome versus the contemporary urban love that is unpredictable and failed. Imtiaz Ali portrays the 2020 Love Aaj Kal in a similar arrangement as his directorial in 2009 by a similar name. The love stories are new with various arrangement of contentions that change with time."
tt10023024,"Took me 5 days to complete lol... Worst acting ever.. overacting ki dukaaan, watching her is a torture .. the script haha moja sungke likha Kya ?"
tt10023024,"It's exactly how I felt after watching this film.
Your should just stream Netflix and chill."
tt10023024,"#FinalVerdictAn Imtiaz Ali film is awaited with bated breath. When you have films like ROCKSTAR (2011), JAB WE MET (2007) and HIGHWAY (2014) to your credit, every step you take, every move you make comes under a microscopic view. Obviously, the expectations from Love Aaj Kal are colossal. Given a title like Love Aaj Kal, the film ought to evoke strong feelings, principally towards the second hour. But the emotional moments fail to evoke any emotion. In fact, your heart doesn't pine for the lovers and that is why Love Aaj Kal fails to create any effect.Without an iota of doubt, you are hypnotized by the initial scenes in Love Aaj Kal, but unfortunately, it's not the screenplay that magnetizes you. The chemistry between Kartik Aaryan and Sara Ali Khan is piping hot and makes you speechless. Surely, Love Aaj Kal is not an easy film to write and execute. Like its predecessor, it has two stories set in different eras, run parallel, but have a similar end. Sadly, the script is riddled with cliches and flaws, which makes Love Aaj Kal a mundane love story that talks of love and heartache. Director Imtiaz Ali is known for his imaginative and inventive take on love stories, but the problem with Love Aaj Kal is that it starts off most impressively, has some terrific moments in between, but the writing gets so erratic and incoherent as it heads towards the conclusion that you wonder, am I really watching an Imtiaz Ali film?With a capable raconteur like Imtiaz Ali at the helm, one expects Love Aaj Kal to be notches above the stuff we've been subjected to in the past. But the film falters after an impressive start, after you are introduced to the pivotal characters in the story. The writing (Imtiaz Ali) gets erratic as you delve deeper and deeper. The second half is stretched without valid reason and that makes Love Aaj Kal a tedious watch. Imtiaz Ali fails to outshine his previous works. Sure, he explores the emotional depths with immense compassion and also draws bravura performances from the central characters. But every film depends on a watertight screenplay and Love Aaj Kal stumbles and fumbles in this department.In a nutshell, Love Aaj Kal suffers from a plot that appears confusing and is convoluted for an avid cinemagoer. Imtiaz Ali's direction fails to complement the screenplay and vice versa. The movie is not a regular run of the mill flick and the proceedings are clearly aimed at the classes rather than the masses. Also, music has always been a mainstay in all of Imtiaz Ali's films. But, sadly, in Love Aaj Kal, it is otherwise. Despite Pritam at the helm of things, the music, sadly, is plain ordinary and does not help in lifting the proceedings. Amit Roy's cinematography is top-notch. Every frame is picture-perfect, a painting on celluloid. Dialogue (Imtiaz Ali) deserve special mention. They are straight out of life. If any film stands on a weak foundation (writing), even 1.30 hours seem never-ending. The lethargic pacing and uneven editing (Aarti Bajaj) also mar the overall impact. The film could have been better had the editing been watertight.Kartik Aaryan carries the most difficult parts with remarkable ease. Sure, we've seen him as the cool, urban guy in several films, but this one's the most demanding role and he glides into the character effortlessly. Sara Ali Khan looks ethereal. More importantly, she acts very, very well. This should be the turning point in her career. Randeep Hooda puts his heart and mind into every project he chooses to perform in. He is a stunner. Arushi Sharma does well in a small, but significant role.To sum up, Love Aaj Kal is too confusing a film to be understood and enjoyed by the general public. It does not live up to the confidence and expectations from the otherwise very skilled and accomplished film-maker Imtiaz Ali. Once the initial euphoria settles down, it'll be difficult for the film to sustain. A KING-SIZED DISAPPOINTMENT! Imtiaz Ali's streak of flops continues!"
tt10023024,"Please please,, do not waste your time and money. you will thank me later."
tt10023024,The movie is pathetic without any clear message. Imitiaz Ali should stop and focus on what he thinks he should convey. Pathetic screenplay with below par performance by Sara and Karthik Aryan. Wish I can get refund. Worst film of 2020 yet!
tt10023024,"Total waste of money, even cheesy new couples will hate it and sorry to say but these 2 neither have any chemistry which could be visible in movie nor they look good together"
tt10023024,"Imtiaz is always know for his interesting story telling and this movie is no exception.
Its a one time watch. There's nothing to hate about this movie.
Do watch guys."
tt10023024,"One of the most worst and annoying movie I had ever seen after ""Dabang3"" Don't waste your money guys...if you're a Kartik Aryan fan don't even dare to watch it. No storyline matlb kuch bhi...."
tt10023024,"U can definitely watch it, it's a good movie... Chemistry of Sartik was outstanding... Loved it.."
tt10023024,"If you read most of the scripts there are many who are putting 10/10.Those must be the producers, directors, script, cast families etc.
They have cleverly pulled the into biased exaggerated false claim.
Nobody gives 10/10🤣.The movie is down sight silly story with unnecessary sex scenes to entice the audience.
There are plenty of F©©© words thrown in. Really Bollywood?
Avoid this movie. It's an insult to Indian culture. 🙏2 points given for Sara Ali Khan's good looks! 💃"
tt10023024,I would disagree with the bad reviews. Sara Ali Khan is good in parts but Kartik Aaryan has played his role very well. He has a great character arch that he portrays with conviction It's a sweet love story and Randeep Honda is the icing on the cake.
tt10023024,Just watch it and then decide. It's much better than you have listened about it.
tt10023024,"Kartik Aaryan in this movie is the most creepiest, cringe worthy character I have ever seen in a bollywood movie. Only saving grace in this movie is Randeep Hooda. As if Kartik Aaryan wasn't enough in one timeline, he plays Randeep Hooda's younger version too.
First version of this movie was so much better and this one should never have been made."
tt10023024,"Cringed all throughout, it was a pain. Never had I noticed that Sara overacts so wildly. She has the worst ""cry face"" and ""angry face"" in all of bollywood. In one of the scenes when she is drunk-crying, she literally looked like one of those dayans from Chandrakanta. Haywire storyline. Karthik's pathetic character doesn't help the movie at all. On top of that, the storyline is haywire ! Poor Randeep Hooda, it was like watching a diamond sinking slowly in a mud pit. You can only shake your head in pity."
tt10023024,Just pathetic and pain to watch this irritating and annoying movie!!Avoid this at any cost!
tt10600398,"Robert Rodriguez is know for his distinctive style. Sometimes it's resonates, sometimes it doesn't. This film does a little of both. As usual the ingenuity of Rodriguez is on full display, but I wish he had a bigger budget to showcase that."
tt10600398,"People who are rating this low and really dragging the movie through the mud are a bunch of Grinches. This is a kids movie and a family movie. Is it cheesy? Heck yeah. Is it worthy of eye-rolls? You betcha. This is what makes it fun. I don't know about you, but I needed this right now. What it through the eyes of a child and enjoy the moment."
tt10600398,The movie takes you back to the world of sharkboy and lavagirl but fails to be what we expected it to be. It's a kid movie and they may love it but definitely not for a mature audience. The plot is super predictable and and the CGI is awful. The only good thing about this film is Pedro Pascal.
tt10600398,"This movie is trash. It has little to do with the prior film, minus the usage of Sharkboy and Lavagirl (who have, at best, 7-10 minutes of screen time). This fact makes it feel almost like an insult to call it a ""sequel to the original"".
The plot is predictable, cheesy, cliche, shall I go on? The CGI is subpar to trash. The usage of green screen is done horribly, and set look so fake, that it's hard for me to take it seriously. Hero names are plain and could be thought of by a toddler. And the main adult superhero is legitimately a Hawkeye knock off (down to the look of the actor) but he fights with swords instead of a bow. It feels almost like a mockbuster than a movie that's meant to be taken seriously."
tt10600398,"As someone who almost exclusively watches movies marketed towards children, I am always willing to forgive bad acting from children. The acting was bad, yes, but how often is it the child Actors in their breakout movie are good? That's not my problem with this movie. My problem is that I have spent longer being mad at this movie than the time it took to actually watch.
The plot was made up as they went along. That is the only explanation I can find for why things were so incoherent. What should have been major plot points, came out to just be major plot holes. The power system does not make sense. The villains didnt make sense at the start, and especially do not make sense at the end. The twists cant even be considered twists, because they either are too obvious to be twists, or have absolutely no warning and function as a ""Gotcha"". There are scenes that are completely invalidated by earlier scenes. I watched this movie with a child, and they asked ""but why are they..."" at various points in the movie. If a child thinks your movie for children doesnt make sense, then your movie for children does not make sense and should not be made. And it definitely shouldn't use Sharkboy and Lavagirl as a nostalgia trap for adults who grew up with that movie."
tt10600398,"Before you read all the salty comments on how predictable, overly easy and cheesy this movie is, keep in mind those people don't seem to realize it's like a Superhero kind of Spy Kids, meant for family and younger audiences. Judging the movie from this place, it's definitely not as bad.Was it a master piece? No. Is it worth one star? Come on! I give it a 6,5 for what it is and I found it very enjoyable, brainless entertainment and I'm sure younger kids would like it even more."
tt10600398,"""This movie is for kids"" you might say. Well, as a 13 year old kid I can say that we kids hate it. The main protagonist's character arc somehow makes her a worse person. This movie is literally an Avengers ripoff. Plot holes everywhere."
tt10600398,My children liked the movie very much and that's all it matters. Everyone with a bad review needs to relax and let kids enjoy a feel-good movie catered for them.
tt10600398,Absolutely horrible acting and the worst plot ever never watch this
tt10600398,"I personally hated it, it was a mess and pretty terrible in general.But
My kids 3, 9 and 11 have watched it 4 times now, i never really understood how adults can rate a show designed for kids.
Clearly its worked for the target audience."
tt10600398,"Just accept it is a kids movie. Pedro Pascal is as usual the highlight (please get him into the MCU). Only pity that someone like Rodriguez directs this kind of movies, after that awesome episode in The Mandalorian."
tt10600398,The gosh darn most cringe I've ever experienced in all of my lifetime I literally cried it was so cringy.
tt10600398,The movie itself is terrible but how many people actually watched it because of Pedro Pascal? I did.
tt10600398,"If your looking for a movie to watch with the kids with good acting, plot and CGI this is not the movie for you.
I sat down with my younger sister to watch this and it's pretty crap, CGI's god awful, it's obvious they spent their $7000 budget on the actors but yet to find any with good acting skills. One thing I really loathe in kids movies is when they try to make them act adult, just doesn't sit right with me, maybe it's classic American kids shows and this Aussie Bloke doesn't get it but Jesus Christ mate at least try to be good, and the excuse of 'it's just a kids movie' is ridiculous, I've seen much better movies out there directed towards children's entertainment with much better acting and story line, thumbs down for me mate 👎🏻"
tt10600398,"Bruh... the kids in this movie looks like they are in a YouTube video, not in a feature film! This is why i don't like this movie! 1/10!"
tt10600398,"A teenage heroic adventure movie.
It is about some children of superheroes who have to go save their parents after being captured by an alien invasion, where they discover the power they have.
With the essence of Robert Rodríguez films.
Quality.
Entertaining
Use the same Mini Spy photo.
A mix between ""Mini spies"" and ""Super school of heroes"".
With quite crazy situations, as well as the director's own effects.
Organic jokes and moments of sarcasm.
Talk about the importance of teamwork.
A nice family movie."
tt10600398,"I thought to myself I should give it a chance because of my children, but when saw it I knew that even children's movie can be horrible. Pls don't watch, your eyes will bleed. Cringiest movie ever made"
tt10600398,It's just a movie for kids people what's wrong with you?
tt10600398,"I am going to be very straight-forward. It was cringe. There were plot holes. The characters lacked depth. The children had 1, maybe 2, emotions through the whole movie. The script was immemorable, so were the characters. I know this movie appeals to a younger audience, but at least keep old Sharkboy and Lavagirl fans in mind, too."
tt10600398,"This film is intended for kids so this is my 6 year olds take on it:
Q. Did you like the movie?A. YES! I like it.Q. What did you like about it?A. I like when they have to fight the aliens because they go an an adventure to save their parents.Q. Who was your favourite character?A. The girl with no powers because she is really smart.Q. How many times have you watched this movie?.A. I've watched it alot of timesQ.its that's good?A. YES!Q. And what would you rate this movie 1 being the worst and 10 being the best?A.i would say 10 because because I like that the super heroes never give up.From a parents point of view this is perfect for my child, it shows morals in showing team work and solving problems, the dialogue and storytelling is easy for my child to understand and follow. There's no hidden adult humour which keeps it clean and light hearted. My child enjoys this movie alot its on her list she's watched it over many times."
tt10600398,"The prequel to this movie, Sharkboy and Lavagirl, wasn't a good watch. It's poorly made with bad effects, a bad plot, and even worse actors. Somehow this film manages to be even worse. It's like they tried to make a superhero version of Spy Kids but with a much worse script and a lot less money. The effects are downright terrible for being made in 2020 and the plot doesn't make sense AT ALL.
The children they cast are passable as far as child actors go, but the adults did underperform. I would think this was to the fault of the script and director.
Sad to see Pedro Pascal in this film, but he has a tendency to pop-up in some bad movies so I can't say I'm totally surprised.
I do understand that this is a children's movie, but when I watched it with my 7-year-old niece and 8-year-old nephew even they were bored.The Spy Kids franchise isn't that great but if you're looking for something similar to this, just a bit better, check those movies out instead."
tt10600398,"Superhero films have dominated the box-office and are popular on streaming-services, but they are too violent for young children. Children that have watched cartoons and who have watched their parents talking about superhero movies shall enjoy this film, which parents can tolerate.Listen for David Bowie's ""Heroes"".As for the artistic merits of the movie, I can say that it was better than spy kids."
tt10600398,"For those who are defending this movie saying ""it's a kid's movie"", Despicable Me, Spies in Disguise, Lion King, Toy Story, Incredibles are some of the movies kids love to watch these days. Please don't insult their intelligence by calling this pathetic excuse of a movie a kid's movie."
tt10600398,Not worth it man...you're better off staring at a wall for an hour
tt11324024,"It's not just the run time (that can be quite nice, if you get everything you want), but in this case you don't. It's a shame because you get the obvious, a sort of general idea, instead of going in depth about the specific raid and how it affected people (many people if not all would have been ideal, not just the generalization this makes).Still I reckon for some this might be eye opening, so maybe it does some good bringing awareness, even if it is only in a smaller degree ..."
tt11324024,"I only heard about this documentary from a news article and thought it would be interesting to watch. The article said that the documentary was about a small Tennessee town that was negatively affected by an ICE raid. At only 25 minutes it's a very short viewing.I watch documentaries to be informed. I like to be informed about things I wasn't aware of before. The better documentary creators give you the most in depth information.The title of this short documentary is ""After the Raid,"" except I learned nothing about the town after the raid! Yes, I heard how the current immigration laws are bad, which I expected, but I mostly wanted to see and hear how an ICE raid affected this small Tennessee town. Unless it escaped me, not even the town's name was given. I didn't learn anything: not how the raid was done, how many were rounded up in the raid, what company was targeted, the financial impact, etc. There was too much missing information.What I did hear was the interview of a woman whose husband was taken, the interview of a local woman that took in a family, and some Catholic services. I get it: ICE and their raids impact immigrant families, tell me something I don't know. This documentary even failed as a human interest story. I don't think I've ever watched a less informative documentary in my life."
tt4570986,This show is probably worst show ever made for kids. IDK why some kids love this show so much.
tt4570986,Full of cringe stupid things and unnecessary drama damn it's a horrible nightmare for me why people are not working hard in their cartoons 😖😖
tt4570986,"Bheem eats coke filled ladoo and takes princess Indumati for late night in the middle of June and all.Kalia is black
btw why is jaggu blue??The king was weak af
But toon toon mosi was ;}Dholu bholu needs complane."
tt4570986,"How awful this show is I can't explain. Animation quality is worse than fist Disney movies from 1937. Wow! There are some good Indian shows like Little krishna, roll no 21 etc but this one, no this is a disgrace in the name of animation. No story no imagination. Characters look like Puppets. Never keep it in your watch list."
tt4570986,"It was very good animation series in india old episodes and movies were having some mature concept teaching lessons like courage.but nowdays it become very lowrated but people has forgot old one chhota Bheem and they only took out negative points of chhota bheem but not positive like courage,viewsight ETC.honble Mr Rajiv chilaka please bring back raj vishwanandha sir for writing stories because nowdays stories are dumb and remove new writer and bring back old art style,pls my humble request to you and those who hate it they don't know if cb was not their so.dbs broly and your name can't be released in theatres."
tt4570986,"This is probably the worst animated show ever made in the history of mankind. There is no imagination, absolutely no humor in this show. The bad animation and character designs just make it worse. On top of it, the music is awful. The only reason for its popularity with kids is that all the good animated shows have been taken off air and this is the only option left for young kids who have never seen good shows."
tt4570986,There are many poor rhyme song and animation available in youtube for 4 or 5 years old kids.Why this stupid rhyme animation is available in TV channels?Have they gone mad?The Cartoon Chota bheem is not just cartoon its a cancer.It doesn't teach you anything about culture or knowledge.It has poor story telling so nothing inspiring even though it has little educational parts.You can easily compare the people or children who waches it and who doesn't in terms of their IQ.
tt4570986,Pointless. This is such a pathetic waste of time! How Such a low graded show is popular is beyond me.
tt4570986,"Started watching Chota Bheem along with the kid and absolutely loved the series. The characters are cute and relatable ( Could not relate to Nobita and gang in Doremon). The lovely village of Dholakpur, the king, the villains are fantastic and engaging."
tt4570986,"This show is arguably one of the most successful and popular animated show in India. The animation and character designs is horrible and single-handedly killed Indian animation industry. This show is also very influential and inspired shows like Mighty Raju, Vir: The robo boy, Chakra etc. I dont know why kids love this show so much."
tt4570986,"This show is not as good as the Masterpiece of Motu Patlu but it's still art and still better than Death Note!Story :- The story is truly well thought out and teenagers love well thought out stories. So do millennial! Best show for teenagers and millennial. This show should be forced upon every teenager and millennial! It should be mandatory to watch it!Animation :- Best Animation since Disney's Fantasia.Characters :- Chhota Bheem is a brave, might warrior of peace! However, he faces evils like Kirmada and the Evil Witch so he defeats them! That's literally better than Attack on Titan.Chhota Bheem keeps Anime in his Chappals and eats Anime Characters like Laddoo!"
tt4570986,I am really not sure why this show is so ducking popular... It is by far the worst cartoon ever....
tt4570986,Its so bad cartoon. Total illogical and nonsense. I love Doraemon.
tt4570986,Just don't watch and don't let ur children watch this show it's just making them dumb just let them watch Japanese anime.
tt4570986,"God help generation watching this show, their brain will be watched. The director must be jailed."
tt4570986,"I once stumbled across Chhota Bheem when I was browsing through our TV. It was hate at first sight. Horrible. But then I just changed the channel and forgot all about it. Now years later I saw that it's brand value is pretty nice. So I googled about it and then came across this page. Saw many 1 star. Thought yes it's apt for the show. But then this thought struck me. The show isn't for us. It's target audience is little kids like under 8. But others who hate it are grown ups especially who have rated it here. And there was this dude who said it just says about the iq of the kids that watch it. Like wow dude what is your iq? Must have been very high with many invention and academic achievements under your name. What stellar achievement you had when you were 7. These are little kids just having fun. Let them have it. The show is horrible, agreed but not like you can just declare all those who watch it as low iq people. The show is pretty successful with it's target audience. You just have to rate it and tell about what you liked about it and what you didn't. But it's pretty wrong to say irresponsible things about others. Hope you learn someday."
tt4570986,"One day my friend told me that you will choose
A.I willl annoy you for a week or B.You will watch chota bheem for a hour
And honestly i choose A because this f$@#ing
show is so mush garbage i can watch popeye the sailor man for a day or dragon Ball z because popeye teach us to eat vegetables and dragon Ball z make us enjoy, these are the two legendary cartoons many 90s kids watch those days but now popeye is ban and dragon Ball z telecaste 11 o'clock in night. Who the hell is doing this"
tt4570986,"My niece said that Mamu I want to watch Chota Bheem, then I also started watching with him and after few minutes, I found it interesting then I watched all series and in the end of episode they always give a beautiful lesson and teach a lots of good things."
tt4570986,"Don't watch it anywhere; be it alone, with family, with kids or on your death bed. Absolute trash"
tt16492950,"I'm surprised by the number of bad reviews that are supposed to be here. There are supposedly 207 reviews before mine but none of them are available to view. I found this show engaging and I always wanted more. I didn't find it completely predictable and I felt like I really cared about the main character. The story is more or less from her point of view, and doesn't show any scene without her as far as I remember. I'm only on the third episode and I have to say the three or four star reviews (or less) which I can't see can't be right. Perhaps that's why they are hidden. I've seen some real stinkers in this isn't one."
tt16492950,Plot with holes. Bad acting full of long slow scenes. A dreadful lead actor whose character behaves irrationally.I sat through two and a half episodes. By that time I was about ready to gnaw my own leg off to get away. So I fast forwarded through the other episodes. In total I gave this silly program about 3 hours of my life that I'll never get back.Do yourself a favour and do anything other than watch this.
tt16492950,"I rated Chosen a 3 and I was being generous. Never have I ever rated a film or series so low. The worst part is I gave it two episodes to redeem itself though it was obvious from the very first scene it wasn't worth viewing. How could no one scripting, producing, directing, edition the mess not realize how completely bad it is? Chosen gets my vote for worst dialogue in film history."
tt16492950,"It amazes me sometimes what people see when they watch shows. This is a short series that crams a lot of themes in. Sense of identity, being an outsider, emotional problems, sexual identity, friendships, strained friendships, parental relationships and all that wrapped around the central mystery of what really happened when the meteor struck in a one horse town in the middle of nowhere.I found it it to be well paced. The mystery is not taxing so its not a 10/10 series but I finished each episode wanting to watch the next immediately.I have seen criticisms on here of the acting but for me the central characters behave and in a way that I have seen thousand times in real life when they consider themselves to be outsiders in some way. As the series progresses certain characters are revealed to have certain secrets and the way others have reacted and behaved previously becomes clearer. If someone appears emotionless, the reason becomes clear.The series ends with some things unexplained and I hope that it means a 2nd series to expand further on what we understand from the first.While I wouldn't say this is a must see it is certainly worth a watch."
tt16492950,"Seventeen year old Emma lives in Middelbo, a town whose sole claim to fame is that it was hit by a meteorite seventeen years before. She works at the meteor museum until an incident leads to her being fired, it also leads her to question whether the 'meteorite' on show at the museum is even real. She gets involved with a group that has other theories about the nature of the incident seventeen years ago. Soon Emma's life is get distinctly strange and more than a little dangerous.I thought this was a decent enough series; it is by no means a classic but equally it is far from terrible. It gets off to a fun start and once Emma has a good idea about the truth there is a good level of threat and some solid action Emma is a good leading character and the supporting group is solid too; if more than a little irritating at times. The self-proclaimed leader of the group is petty and childish most of the time; jealous that Emma is discovering things as soon as she joined while the others never really found anything. The cast is solid enough with Malaika Mosendane being likeable as Emma. Many questioned are answered by the end of the sixth, and currently final, episode but more are raised leaving scope for another season; if there is more I'll watch.These comments are based on watching the series in Danish with English subtitles."
tt16492950,"Over half of this show is what I guess to be suspense build up. You get 25 cuts of someone walking, with music building up for every piece of dialogue delivered. There is no real explanation given for mostly everything going on and the characters aren't asking any.The show also tries to focus in and spends way too much time on a love triangle thing that just does not work and adds needless sex scenes. It is like the entire story was written around a 17 year old girls sex life."
tt16492950,"I'm usually in on any Nordic series, so I didn't bother looking too much into this before starting. I am super happy how it turned out and I hope there is more to come."
tt16492950,"Mostly here to counter-review the plethora of naysayers- it's entertaining and not about a bunch of bored American teens being ridiculous.The comments about ""bad parenting"" seem almost scripted."
tt16492950,"I love good SciFi, but what this show is delivering instead is stupid behavior of the main characters. Totally non-existent ethics because the main character is just selfish beyond believe and the question: Are danish parents really allow their 16 year old daughters to run off with a full bottle of hard whiskey to have a ""great time"" alone at night with lots of strangers and NOT questioning this on the next day!?If this is a mirror for the things to come now at Netflix, I will quit!"
tt16492950,"Literally in two minutes I saw the dumbest character I've ever seen in my whole life, the protagonist make one stupid decision behind the other and the rest of the characters or are as stupid as her or change their personality in literally two sentences.It's like the last season of ""The Rain"" all over again...Please Jannik READ what you write before finishing your job."
tt16492950,"Imagine the worst ever story in an earthbound edition of Doctor Who, mixed in with every ill-fitting and irrelevant cliche of bad low budget sci-fi you can think of. Compound this mess with almost nothing anyone says or sees making any sense at all, or in any way leading on from the previous scene. Expect nothing to be explained properly, as all you get to see is a few repellent teenagers going around a small town in a torturously slow non-story occasionally coming across something nonsensical. Watching this had me half wondering if the pages of the script had been randomly shuffled after being mixed in with other totally different series!"
tt16492950,"The story kept me interested, and there was intrigue. Enough that I watched the full series in a short space of time. The Sci-fi elements were really good. It was enjoyable at moments, but it was far from problem free. One of the main plot points I saw coming from the word go.BUT I disliked how unhealthy many of the relationships between the characters were. I was hoping for a teen, let's discover ourselves whilst we uncover this mystery and get to the truth. There was so much backstabbing, and all the characters hurting each other a lot.Also no one actually talked to each other, instead they jumped to conclusions, lied, and often did something stupid behind someone's back. With the exception of Marie, she was the only really likeable character.Emma even did this to her Mum. Mads was actually vile. A lot of these things were often different to how the characters started out, and seemed to be there just to forward the plot.I can honestly understand the mixed reviews to this."
tt16492950,"This series had some moments of intrigued, but, nonetheless, it is one if those series where you can fall asleep during part of an episode and when you wake up you didn't miss much!!!"
tt16492950,If you want to know how not to parent watch this show. They will let their kids do just about anything and with no supervision.They do have the required lesbian relationship that seems to be a required checkbox these days if that's your cup of tea.
tt16492950,"There's a lot of shots of the main girl walking very slowly and staring blankly at things. Then every now and then something happens. I never felt much emotional connection to anyone. At the end, all I felt was indifferent. The song selections all felt awkward and out of place too. I doubt there will be a second season, but if there is, I definitely won't waste my time watching it."
tt16492950,"It had me from the beginning. In every episode there is one question that always come up, who can you trust. When you think you have it all figured out a surprise is at the end. I gave this series 10 stars because I normally do not watch series and when you see I do it's because it's good."
tt16492950,"It's not a masterpiece AND lately there none so it passes. I think there are sublime and subtitle messages but a second season will be needed to bring them to fruition. Yes, it could have been better but it was enough to keep me engaged."
tt16492950,"Did I say bad? If not, be aware, it's bad!Bad story, bad actors. Idea could have been delivered in a good way, but no, not here.So many other things worth your time, hit next."
tt16492950,"Like many European shows like this one it's gloomy, bleak and dark. Featuring desolate dirt roads and abandoned buildings. There can't be anymore than a handful of pages of dialog in the entire series. The characters are shadows, unable to draw you in or relate to them."
tt7924854,My 2 year old daughter is loving this show. It is imaginative and teaches her things. I haven't seen anything inappropriate and am happy it makes her happy.
tt7924854,The characters in here are scary and look weird and makes baby's cry
tt7924854,"My 2yo has been enjoying this show every morning, since she's been watching it. Now I wish certain things are real, like a popcorn storm."
tt9077192,"Usually Netflix tries to at least keep their original content somewhat interesting or at least decent caliber entertainment, but this show is down right ridiculous on all levels.
They focus on ""true"" haunting accounts that showcase people that I just could just not even attempt to take seriously due to their hysterical demeanor and almost over the top claims that made it seem like they were paid actors to appear actually haunted. Now I'm not saying that some of these people haven't actually been victims of some form of hauntings, but the embellished stories on this show seem like watered down cliche horror shorts that the production team/Netflix came up with to pass as true accounts. The emotions portrayed just don't seem authentic from the people at all and the show overall seems like a cheap addition in time for Halloween. The production value is decently solid for the re-enactments with some ok visuals no matter how ridiculous. The only episode that was at least passable and effective at times was the abduction story which had some genuinely well done visuals and intensity though it might be embellished as well. As a whole, the series is almost more comical than anything."
tt9077192,"I don't know if the people telling these stories are actors or if they're real and they believe what they're saying. Either way, this show is freaking depressing. I've watched two episodes, and both hinge on small children who have suffered neglect and abuse witnessing violent murders. I have a feeling all of the episodes are going to be this way. If these people are real, then what they need is professional help, not a tv show exploiting their trauma and encouraging the delusions they created to cope with it. If they're just actors, then presenting the storytellers as real and their miserable stories as true is in seriously poor taste. This show is not scary, just sad. I love horror, and I love the types of stories that make me suspend--or even question--my disbelief in the supernatural. This show didn't make me suspend disbelief; it just made me want to get the storytellers to a therapist."
tt9077192,"So many bad reviews just because your tiny mind can't comprehend ghosts/demons obviously don't exist in such a massive/infinite universe. Also yes it says it's a true story, but didn't they say the same thing about paranormal activity? It's just to make it that tad more spooky to watch at night imagining if it was real. Yeah sure the dock part is cringy af, but I'm judging this from a normal horror series point of view, and I think it's got some good spooky vibes and decent scares. Just watch it like any other horror movie/series and you'll enjoy it more. (Giving this a six because Haunting of Hill House was just perfect)."
tt9077192,"Beggining with episode 1 i was intrigued, but my questions kept piling up.. then when it came to episode 2 i stopped watching. Netflix needs to understand they have to give more information to these accounts. it's one person telling their story, poorly. there are no names, facts or evidence period. I'm really aggravated with Netflix's sloppiness on this show because it had potential to be very interesting. After watching the second episode, you will have one million questions & zero answers leaving you completely unsatisfied.. Would absolutely not recommend to anyone."
tt9077192,"What made this series so poor was that it is advertised as supposedly true stories based on interviews from the victims. Perhaps the ""true story"" aspect was intended to make it seem scarier, but in reality, it was a distraction. First of all, as other reviewers are saying, there was no evidence to back up any of these accounts. Second, the stories were so over the top that it was highly unlikely they were true. If they would have left out the true aspect, cut out the interviews, and just made this a scary anthology series of ghost stories, it could be pretty good."
tt9077192,"First of all, You can't look at this from a ""where are the facts"" kind of way. It doesn't claim to be an investigative series. It's like telling ghost stores around a campfire. It says based on a true story bc the people telling it believe it to be true. Nothing about this show is actually factually based and I believe that to be the point. It's cool cinematography and is a bit scary/troubling. The slaughterhouse episode is outlandish, but it's meant to be taken at face value. Its not a damn documentary, like these people making the other comments are expecting it to be."
tt9077192,"I suppose that most horror stories, have to have their roots in some sense of fact. The shows don't always ring true, but it is entertaining. I mostly liked the story telling format, told from the aspect of the actual victims. It's interesting."
tt9077192,Not sure whether this is real or not but I suspect the storytellers are just bad actors. The stories aren't believable or even scary. The episode about the alien abduction had me questioning why aliens always arrive in saucers and yet NASA send rockets into space - should somebody telll NASA saucers are more practical. Also why nobody noticed she was being abducted or why she didn't set up CCTV to prove her story. Too many unanswered questions and an insult to viewer's intelligence.
tt9077192,"As the title suggests, this is a show about people with untreated PTSD...
All of them have experienced something traumatic at a young age, and now they see ghosts.Really, instead of exploiting them on TV, these people should be offered councelling, or some other forms of help."
tt9077192,"If any of this is true it's just sad. I'm two episodes in and it's just children experiencing trauma that never gets treated and they suffer from delusions. If you think this is about paranormal stuff, don't watch it, because it's not. Literally just exploiting trauma. If an inch of any of this is true the police and psychotherapists need to be involved. Just. Pathetic. No explanations for anything. I'm shocked that this is so terrible, but I guess not really. Thanks for wasting my time, Netflix."
tt9077192,"I know this is a Netflix original, but it's not as good as Shudder's British mini-series 'True Horror."" Same exact concept, but those guys just did it better. Watch both and come to your own conclusion. So far though, my vote goes to True Horror. Better directing with the re-enactments and none of their friends are sitting around in set designed 'spooky rooms' nodding their heads. Bad decision on whoever's idea that was. True Horror guys, look it up and watch it."
tt9077192,"I've seen a million horror movies that spoof series that claim to uncover real Haunted places, but have never watched an episode of a series like that myself. I have, however, seen hundreds and hundreds of horror movies, and I'm hard to scare. I think like a storyteller (I'm a journalist) so finding something that feels nuanced is rare. This is an interesting hybrid of real stuff that supposedly happened to real people and fairly high budget re-enactments. It's also a hybrid of real-life horror (violence, neglected mental illness, crime) and supernatural occurrence, which makes it a little more unsettling than a regular movie. It's also a recounting of actual crimes and very real trauma that has destroyed lives. Whether or not you believe in the supernatural, the people who lived through what they lived through definitely believe it, and as bleak as it is, for these first two subjects. there's no real happy ending in sight. I'm not curious to see what the next few episodes reveal, as it's too bleak and depressing to be enjoyable. It's not for the faint of heart, it's disturbing on several levels, and it needs to be said that for the people starring in this show, the real PTSD they've been experiencing and living with deserves some very real healing. My advice, watch the first episode and call it a day."
tt9077192,"This show just seems so exaggerated that you immediately think that it isn't real. These are people making up stories who trying to make a quick buck. I'm only two episodes in but if any of these events occurred, some newspaper or someone would have tried to make it known. Ridiculous."
tt9077192,"To everyone wanting proof and evidence... Umm, really? These are stories told by individuals, and recreated for entertainment. Like anything supernatural, it's up to the viewer to choose if they want to believe. The production value is well done, and tends to be creepy. I have enjoyed my time with the program, not needing validation. If you can take this program for what it is, then you won't be disappointed."
tt9077192,"Based on the majority of user reviews here, I expected this series to be terrible. But it's October and I'm running out of scary things to watch so I gave this a try, and was pleasantly surprised. Some of the stories are traumatizing and horrifying, but I think if you've read the description for this show you already expect that. It's not a documentary, don't expect a deep dive into the ""if it's real of not"". This is best described as taking ghost stories around a campfire to the next level by adding the dramatic interludes with actors playing out parts of the story. Not the greatest scary show I've ever watched but you're getting exactly what the description promises: people telling stories of their own hauntings with some extra dramatization."
tt9077192,"I can't tell if this is supposed to be horror or comedy, but either way it's so hilariously bad that I can't help but love it. This show takes itself so seriously and yet it's completely unaware of how absolutely ridiculous it is. These ""true"" paranormal events are about as Hollywood as it gets, and they're all reinacted by quite possibly some of the worst actors I've seen in a LONG time in a Netflix original. If you're looking for something genuinely creepy to get you into the Halloween spirit, don't watch this show. There is plenty of legitimately good horror content on Netflix that can do the job far better than this. HOWEVER, if you want to watch something with literally zero self-awareness that you can point and laugh at after having a few drinks with your friends, please do watch this, it's amazingly entertaining in that context. My sides were hurting halfway into the first episode I was laughing so hard, this is on almost the same level as The Room in terms of great bad entertainment."
tt9077192,"The first episode drug me in.... very good, very believable 10/10!
The second episode was just the opposite. I just sat there shaking my head... 1/10.
I continued to watch the short series hoping for another like episode 1, but all the rest were just somewhere in the middle...
Don't waste 3 hours of your life"
tt9067020,"For around 6 years, TV Series ""Lost"" remained on my watchlist, but unfortunately, it was not available on any OTT platform, leaving me unable to watch it. While I had watched several good movies in the same genre during my quest for ""Lost,"" such as ""Welcome to the Jungle"" and ""Cast Away,"" both were good, the latter stood out as an absolute classic gem.This time, I discovered an entire series that piqued my interest. The scenic locations portrayed in the series were truly spectacular and visually arresting. The name itself allured me, promising a great experience. Sometimes, we do watch contents based on the first-look and the name, however, they can be deceiving and could fool us.Unfortunately, the writing in the series proved to be quite lackluster, greatly diminishing the potential of the entire script. The pace of the story's development was slow, and it failed to truly captivate me. Consequently, I couldn't help but feel disappointed.Despite a few glorious moments and attractive scenes, including those featuring girls in bikinis, they couldn't salvage the overall justice of the series. Regrettably, I would have to rate it a mere 3.5/10."
tt9067020,"See, i don't remember where but i remember reading somewhere for chaos to build up the characters need to give wrong unexpected decisions. I guess that's the motto of this series. But it is applying it wrong, really wrong. I guess this is what happens when the creators are not down to earth and trying to create ""art"" rather than being familiar. Every decision the characters make are laughable. Every act they proceed is unfamiliar and unreal. The four i gave is for the crew that had to work on that conditions."
tt9067020,"After watching all 7 episodes in one day, this made me wonder ""what was the point of making this?"" This could have had a lot of potential but tried to hard to not be like ""Lost"" that it comes off as a cheap movie version of Lost.
I think all the writers that were fired on Lost all got together, came up with all the ideas that didn't work, found the one executive in charge of programming at Netflix that never saw a single episode of Lost & convinced them to fund it. They even write in some blatant references to Lost in the first episode.This show could have been done far more enticing things if it had been expanded to 13 episodes. They really could have amped up the mystery of what was happening if they had actual time to expand the whole story. Instead they give away all the mystery by the 4th episode and after that there was no point for the last 3.Very disappointing for what it is and what it could have been."
tt9067020,"I kept watching this. I don't know why...maybe some kind of masochistic self hate?The plot? Terrible. The main characters? Terrible. The secondary characters? Especially terrible (I'm looking at you, Warden). The dialogue? TERRIBLE. WHY? Why did I keep watching this? Why wasn't it better? Who made this? Can we stop them from ever making something again? Terrible. Just terrible. I truly cannot believe I finished it. It doesn't get better. It just doesn't."
tt9067020,Certainly this money could've been used for season 3 of The OA. Just Awful.
tt9067020,The shows first few episodes were poorly scripted but I persevered. By episode 3 it starts to pick up and the plot starts to develop and you start to think things will get better until the twist at the end feels like a slap to the face. If you like getting slapped in the face watch this series.
tt9067020,"All of the episode titles are quotes from ""The Tempest."" (""Oh brave new world that has such creatures in it""-in light of the play telling us at once that pretty faces disguise dark hearts.) One subplot of ""The Tempest"" is that Prospero the magician has a ship carrying a variety of noblemen and courtiers to his island and has them wander around thinking they are alone and tested by various illusions in order to find out if they are good people at heart, mediocre people, or bad people. That's what happens in this series, more or less. Prospero uses a spirit being named Ariel to make this happen, much as two people show up to guide or warn and to watch the survivors. At the end of the play, Prospero makes his decisions. Knowing this makes the series more fun."
tt9067020,It is a weird show and the acting isn't the best.. but if you can make it through the first 2 episodes the concept gets better than what you might think. Keep an open mind and give it a shot.
tt9067020,"Poor acting, poor direction, and ridiculous dialogue. The characters are completely unlikeable and unrelatable. I don't see this show going anywhere, tbh."
tt9067020,"Literally made an account just to say this show is actually pretty decent. Much, MUCH better than the first episode.... Not really even sure what was up with that. It's definitely a Lost rip off (the characters almost exactly) but it's entertaining and does have its own plot and twists. I feel like all of the bad reviews either came from people who didn't watch even through the first episode, or are just trolls. Give it a chance. It won't win any awards, but it's a great binge show."
tt9067020,"I'm 100% behind most of these reviews when only applied to the first two episodes.Beyond episode 3, however, is a nice sci-fi plot reminiscent of Black Mirror. Stick with it sci-fi fans and to Netflix, actually make good pilots!"
tt9067020,"Somehow, all the worst possible actors and actresses end up on the same island in this Netflix series. If that's not enough, they all react to situations in the exact opposite manner a normal human would. I'm still confused as to how Netflix put their name on this?"
tt9067020,"So Netflix price has went up £2.00 again in the UK
They cancel great films and series, then make this... Really???They had a fun show like Santa Clarita Diet, but cancelled it.Use our money to get top actors and great writers, then I wont mind paying a premium.Poor show Netflix"
tt9067020,"You might THINK you want to watch this. Maybe you miss Lost... or maybe you like bad... I mean REALLY bad TV. This show is kind of like seeing the Room but with better looking production values. But the dialog is as bad, the acting is as bad. It's just not as much fun as The Room. There are some truly hilariously memorable moments. A woman shooting a guy in the stomack with a flare gun that goes straight through his body (not possible) but as he falls onto his back, he's not even really bleeding... As amusing as this is, it's not worth wasting your time on. How is it possible that Neil Labute's name is attached to this? Go watch Billy and Billie if you want to see how brilliant he truly is."
tt9067020,This is so bad that it's going to be studied by future generations. It's completely mind-boggling that something like this can be made in 2019. I'm impressed!
tt9067020,Yes it is difficult to watch in the beginning. Characters are very annoying. But if you manage to fight through first 3 episodes it might get a bit easier. Or maybe it's just my fascination for psychological stuff which saved it for me. But 1/10 reviews are a bit too harsh..
tt9067020,It wasn't the greatest show on earth but it was still better than the one average. It's only seven episodes just stick with it it's not that bad!
tt9067020,Predictable script until u get into episode 3. It gets better as you go so stick with it.
tt9067020,"I'm on the 5 episode and I'm hooked!! Even though a few of the actors are not that great, I'm invested in the overall cast!!"
tt9067020,It's genuinely mind boggling that people are willing to invest money to produce this show.
tt9067020,"Awful dialogue, no likable characters and not intriguing enough to wait for mystery reveal."
tt9717424,"Cheesy script, poor acting and line execution. It's trying to be like 2010 Disney but it's somehow worse lol. None of the characters are super likeable either. If you wanna watch a better family show, try Alexa and Katie on Netflix. It's a bit more bearable than this."
tt9717424,"Disgusting acting, disgusting plots, terrible jokes. Horribly horrific show."
tt9717424,"This show is not a role model for kids, I can't believe they made this."
tt9717424,"All the characters are vapid and annoying, you lose 200 brain cells every minute you watch this. And most of the ""humor"" is derived from potty jokes and refrences; would rather watch Shark Tale than this mess; so predictable."
tt9717424,If you want a headache this is the show for you! None of the characters are likeable and the entire show is ham acting at its best. So over the top with jokes that aren't even funny and half of the actors put on ridiculous voices. Cringe
tt9717424,"Taking a page from the Kardashians, this show tries so hard to be cool and hip. But more like a hip that needs replacing. The main character is shallow, pedantic and ridiculously obnoxious. Do not let your children watch this, lest they think this is how to be. How did this ever get made? With actors whose performances are more hated than John WIlkes Boothe's at Ford's Theater in April of 1865. Save your brain cells, skip this."
tt9717424,"This show is ridiculously funny. It's one of the better comedy series I've seen on Netflix in a while and it's honestly on par with series like Jessie. I'm really excited for more episodes to drop out of the 20-episode initial order. I don't have high hopes the series will be renewed for a season two, but a person can be hopeful. Also, a series like this is what I initially expect to be on networks like Disney Channel, mainly because Disney is typically known for series like this, like (again) Jessie, which was one of my favorite comedy series too before it ended its run back in 2015. Netflix honestly needs more series like this! :)"
tt9717424,"This show is absolutely horrendous, even for a Netflix sitcom for kids. Seriously I've seen better on the Disney channel. You might watch it and think that the humour isn't so bad, but then you realize that these jokes have been told a billion times before this. The humour is basic and the show is appalling. Would not recommend"
tt9717424,"This is not the best series but I like it, the beginning isn't perfect but the next episodes are pretty good and I like the characters, excited to watch others parts"
tt9717424,Original Comedy Series.10/10 The series is very funny.
tt9717424,"10/10 thats a good show , i hope next part comes soon"
tt10145110,"Netflix ""originals"" have always been hit or miss. Their horror track record seems to be decent (minus the hemlock grove series)Anyways. I wasnt immediately sold on the idea of this show. The cover art made it seem cheesey (full moon cheesy) and the video preview wasnt exactly enticing.I decided to give it a shot when I literally couldnt find anything else to watch.First episode almost made me quit. Not gonna lie. It wasnt bad but it just dragged on. When it got into the 2nd episode and beyond it got pretty good.It's not ""scary "" per se but a good suspense thriller at best with supernatural elements.At the end of day its better than average but nothing that differentiates itsself from anything out of the genre.6/10"
tt10145110,"It was okay. It wasn't as horrible as the other reviews made it seem. There was some bad acting, but that's to be expected. The plot isn't that great and some scenes are a little forced and unconvincing. There's no character development either. Good enough for an ""easy"" watching teen drama, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend someone watches it."
tt10145110,"First off let me say Enzo Barone is an excellent up and coming actor. I see a grand future for him. The story would have made a good movie. As a series, it was terribly convoluted."
tt10145110,"Couldn't watch more than 2 episodes
I have watched some good Brazilian shows and this one wasn't one of them for sure
Terrible casting and acting
There are so many better alternatives on Netflix than this that it's a total waste of time to watch
Watch Kingdom, Ash vs evil dead or even Diablero instead"
tt10145110,"Why why why do i keep my Netflix subscription??
This series is nothing but a b Series crap.
Its boring, its lame and the acting could be done better by monkeys. Avoid"
tt10145110,Wish the undead could've conjured up a better script and actors for this poorly written debacle.
tt10145110,I watched 10 minutes and then ... Nope! Kdkdjdjfkdkdldkdkdkdkdbfbdkdkdk
tt10145110,"Just finished the first episode, and I'm excited to start the next one. The character introductions gave a juicy taste of the spirit of each one, enough to draw you in, wanting to know more. It showcased the basic rules of the world, and introduced you to a freak-fest of spooks, kooks, and potential villains.The lovely dangling threads of possible arcs and stories were wonderful, as were the interweaving lines of the culture and energy of Sao Paolo.I'm a sucker for the interweaving of multiple cultures into a story, doubly so when that story has creepy dolls, witch queens, wrathful wraiths, and ""wait a second, isn't that dude dead?"" The cinematography was a gift, and while the dialogue hasn't been particularly inspiring, I've enjoyed every minute of it.Obviously being on the first episode means my review will change quite a bit as I go. But for now, I'm loving the supernatural-horror-suspense-drama of Spectros."
tt10145110,"I personally loved this show. There is nothing better than a mystery and when you add horror to that you have the upper most level! This is an original and has a great story line. It bit of romance, culture, ghost story and family fun all folded up in mystery. If you don't like dubs, then stay clear, because your eyes will fixate on the speech movement and you will lose the big picture. I love it and am hoping for a second season. Netflix has brought many of these little gems to us and I am very grateful; especial during lock down!"
tt10145110,"Imagine barely getting any black actors in a show but when they do they make the black girl look angry and it really freaking threw me off in the whole show. Like are you kidding me?!!! I'm tired of seeing directors put them in ""bully"" or ""rude"" positions, and not sign them up for the kind ones. It's so freaking dumb!"
tt10145110,Too many things wrong with this show to focus on one thing. Just all around terrible. Waste of time. I regret the time I lost watching this mess. Too many things wrong with this show to focus on one thing.
tt10145110,"I do not understand the low rating this show received. It has a nice story, good characters and acting, and an unusual background. The story happens in a Japanese neighbourhood in Brasil- I loved the filming location. The characters speak in Portuguese and ocassionally in Japanese. In a nutshell - three teenagers become involved in a necromancer's plot and reluctantly try to save the world. The show is not really scary (I'm very sensitive), and is more character-driven. Try it, it's nice (and do not quit just after the first episode)."
tt10145110,"I'm not sure why people are giving this show bad reviews. They try to translate as best as they can and I think they did a good job. There's 2 cultures being merged while a third one watches it, and doesn't understand. I love the storyline. It's unique. I guess it's one of those things, if you love it you really love it and if you don't, you hate it."
tt10145110,I really loved this show. Binged watch it in one go and wished there had been more. Padal was my favorite character and was portrayed so well it reminded me of the guys I grew up with and loved so much. Good job on this storyline too! I felt it was really unique and well done.
tt14482414,"Dear writernim & PDnim, I admire your amazing script with lots of beautiful & heartwarming stories just like in your previous dramas. I love this series but please cut that inappropriate scenes in eps 5 immediately!!! It hurts us as citizen of a country who have great history in badminton."
tt14482414,"Looks like this series has been brigaded, which is a shame. It's standard Korean fare, multiple story lines, lots of characters, some cringey stories but overall still a fun show with likeable characters.There's some regrettable comments about another country in one episode, but it is what it is."
tt14482414,"I have a feeling the Indonesians dragged the average score a bit down because of the things said in episode 5. The show isn't all that bad. It is not really about badminton it is more used as a way to bind the characters together. The main plotline is really interesting and fun but the sub plotlines about the village members bored me quit a bit and often had to much screen time, therefore my low score."
tt14482414,It's a decent-ish drama but there is some scene in there that is kinda disrespectful.
tt14482414,"This is a charming coming of age tale against the backdrop of country life and high school sports.🏸B is a great show for families to watch together, as long as the subtitles aren't an obstacle. Qualities that the show reinforces include: Loyalty, standing up for what's right, defending the weak, hard work, compassion, respect, and teamwork.It follows badminton teams from schools in rural Korea. There's not alot to do in a town that doesn't have sufficient population to support many forms of entertainment. It's even difficult to get wifi. Sports and friendships are what the kids work on most. We follow them through regular match-ups, individual and team competitions, and various family dynamics, as they gradually become a cohesive unit. The show, additionally, addresses the problem of vicious hazing and other abuses that can arise in a group of uber competitive Type-A personalities.Positive cross-generational relationships are displayed in RB. The elderly couple that lives down the road loves to host the kids. They share a meal and, more significantly, their wifi. In return, the kids help them with reading and operating their cell phones. It's darling.YIKES! A Fight❕ We see another side of the coin in a town hall where a village elder and one of the young players tackle eachother over conflicting ideas over how to generate more business in town. The problem, apparently, is that they have matching personalities😉. Neither one of them has good ideas anyway😆. It's a funny scene.The kids help plan a birthday party for the oldest grandma in town. The whole thing is precious. As grandma is from Busan, can you guess what movie they played? Yep, the Zombie thriller: 🚄 To Busan. All Young-tae saw was that the title contained the word ""Busan."" Some of the party-goers didn't open their eyes for 2 hours, lol.It's impossible to review this show without addressing the controversy that has arisen around it. In ep5, an athlete was met with some boos while playing in 🇮🇩Indonesia. There were some that saw this as an insult to their country. In The West we generally don't understand much about Asian culture. It does appear that they are sincere about their complaint as it is a matter of their honor, and we should accept that. However, being offensive was obviously not the intent of Netflix & the show creators.Instead of giving feedback, a world wide vocal group took to their keyboards and attacked the show and Netflix as if insult was intended. It spread over social media and the ever-outraged went out of their way to give the show a low rating. Most Kdramas have under 3000 viewers on IMDB registering their ratings of a given show. Contrast that with 🏸B, which had a whopping 24k ratings of ""1"" weeks before all the episodes were out❗ I actually watched 🏸B to find out how bad it was. I'd never seen such a low rating on IMDB.I wonder if most of the people on the 🚄-to-umbrage actually saw this show before they rapaciously rambled down the tracks? Anyone posting a review having never watched the show is neither genuine nor trustworthy. The show creators are much tougher on their own🇰🇷country than anywhere else. I initially breezed by ep5 and never noticed anything offensive. (To be fair, I'm originally from right outside of Philadelphia, where the fans are notorious for being ill-behaved. I'll grant that my bar must be a little skewed downward by that;)There's no perfect country. Perhaps everyone should unclutch their pearls, remove the shuttlecock from their eyes, and take a wider-angle view of the issues here👀: What happens in ep5 is trivial compared to what actually goes on in sports.Fans in 🇬🇧Wembley🏟 have booed during other team's national anthems.It's shocking to hear that fans in 🇪🇦Spain have done monkey chants and thrown bananas at African players😱.Sadly, fans in 🇺🇲Philadelphia really did boo 🎅 and throw snowballs at him.Suspicions were raised against the New England Patriots that they had listening devices planted in the away locker rooms. Peyton Manning would not discuss anything sensitive in the locker room at Gillette🏟. Tony Dungee would not allow his players to have possession of their playbooks as anything left in their Boston hotel rooms was liable to end up with Belichick's staff prior to the game. There's other stories of away locker rooms with poor lighting, bad smells, no heat or the thermostat not working right, no hot water, etc etc. Are the outraged here even sports fans? If so, they would know that some fans can be rabid maniacs. Right or wrong, sports is a venue that fans utilize to vent their frustrations.I've even seen reviewers sneering at badminton: They write that it is a poor concept for a show. Badminton happens to be quite popular in all of Asia. The competition is intense, with the shuttlecocks, or birdies, typically flying off the racket at speeds up to 250 mph. Speeds have been recorded as high as 267 mph. This makes it the fastest sport in the 🌎 That Shuttlecock would win its share of pro drag races at those speeds.Most of the actors in this show are KIDS. They all delivered first rate performances. People are heartless to trash the WHOLE show into which these kids clearly put their whole hearts. Their efforts deserve praise. Kang Hoon-kim (Yong-tae) is particularly special. He is a scene stealer; a top-shelf talent. Tang Joon-sang, who plays Hae-kang, is also quite talented. He plays a boy with Aspergers in Move To Heaven, and the sweetest North Korean soldier ever, in Crash Landing On You {Don't miss that one, btw}. The parts are characters that are completely unique from each other, and he's convincing in these roles. Ahn Se-bin plays the coach's youngest daughter, age 5 or so. She steals every scene she's in, and she also teaches the elderly couple how to read. It's cuteness overload.Finally, the whole show is cuteness overload. It couldn't be more adorable, and these kids could not be more precious. So give it a fair go and cheer these kids on; even if you are a Pats fan :) 😉 ;)"
tt14482414,"I was initially attracted to this drama. But when entering episode 5, there is a scene that makes my interest disappear, even though I also like the funny scenes in this drama. I feel that the production team made a scene that is very offensive to my country. I mean, you guys can make drama without badmouthing other people."
tt14482414,"I'm from Indonesia. I'm sad for Ep 5 too. BUT, wont it be way better if we SHOW people that we're not like what Indonesia look like in Ep 5?? I mean, Rusia often potrayed as bad country in numerous films, Arab-related country as terrorist etc. What makes people dont feel that way? Because in real life, ITS NOT TRUE! Show people that indonesian supporter are not like that! SHOW PEOPLE, dont act like you're strong just because you guys can speak freely in social mediaThis drama is not really badminton-centric that shows intense competition with badminton retaled story in every episode (in football, like tsubatsa hahaga). Its more an entertaining, fun with young artists type of drama. There're lots of young artist playing in this drama, so many crews put effort for this drama, etc. Just because the writer's fault, you guys give such a very low score. I mean its cruel:"")"
tt14482414,"It's very sad to see that in eps 5 the portrayal of another country is shown really disrespectful, and what for?It's invalid and doesn't show respect towards a country that really loves K-Drama. I'd say wrong move, Racket Boys :("
tt14482414,"Loved this. A story about playing badminton. Have respect for badminton players because we tried it at school, and I had neither the grace nor temperament for it.Characters are all well depicted. Cussing involved is not a whole lot compared to the unintelligent use of the fword in grade A or grade B pictures. But comes from mouths of kids. Why I'm not surprised or offended? As one who entered teaching service in 2005, less than 20 cusswords minus the fword is nothing compared to what I heard in my first hour on a compound. Rough baptism indeed.Depiction of characters is top-class and comedic intent in some scenes undeniable. But plot and subplot raise social issues and delivery of latter provoked deep respect for creators for doing so. So, while not as interesting as main plot, it is top of the class among subplots because it has worth and specific to local audience. Many may disapprove because it doesn't take them far from reality and cussing raises an uncomfortable truth- it jolts you back to earth.But if you let go of your offense at cussing or annoyance at a few of the characters in the subplot, you find hilarity that is both good for the bones but bad for under garments. So, thanks for keeping art with a social conscience alive. Today's viewing is often about escapism via mindless entertainment and not necessarily an act of curiosity. Too often we demand more from television and other entertainment services than we have the courage to demand from politicians and too much market trends bear witness to the awful truth: in this modern world too many are not as smart as their phones yet pride themselves on being smarter than their ancestors.If you need to laugh, watch this. If you desire to learn of the fate of other sports or care to learn about, or from, a different culture or people, watch this. If you want to see good talent in an under-rated drama, watch this. If you can stand not to be part of fashion trends on social media, watch this.If not, be happy with allowing your phone or social media to direct your train of thought. New colonialism is subtle but powerful and makes millions for the few everyday. Deadly, invisible, effective... Racket Boys just contain a little antidote. Why be bitter or complain. Even if powerless, never hide from the truth."
tt14482414,"It's a show with some heart warming story lines. True, there is some xenophobic plotlines, but rest of it is good and clean entertainment."
tt14482414,"Contains about racism in some episodes, and it leads from my country
I totally disagree about racism, Damn I'm so upset."
tt14482414,"Not enough to humiliate another country in the olympic opening ceremony, they do it again here. Bravo."
tt14482414,"A lot of clichés to start with, but everything is sorted out for the best as often is the case with teenage groups. A surprising amount of decent badminton showing dedication, commitment, technical progress, challenges met and conquered. A glimpse of the pressure the kids and their coaches are under, as well as the situation in a typical agricultural township which is gradually experiencing depopulation and all of its inconveniences. Some confusing parts,
such as suggesting a third of the way through that Hae Kang Yoon and Se Yoon were in elementary school together when in fact he was from Seoul and she from Daegu. Though its a highschool team we never meet any other students, aside of the 25 baseball players, there is nobody that isn't a badminton player. There seem to be only 7 adults in the whole town yet they initially truly believe they've been outvoted about the development proposal even though it's being proposed by a man they have little regard for to a room full of these same 7 people, none of whom wanting to accept the terms.But if you collect the names of Korean dishes you will be well served as food is hugely important and symbolic in this show, if that's your thing it'll peak your curiosity.With one more episode I am amazed at the speed in which I devoured the whole series. Excellent character development and some wonderful acting. My favorite scene is probably when the whole town came to cheer in typical festivity garments."
tt14482414,I don't understand why this beautiful and innocent drama has so many haters!! For me it was a breath of fresh air. Loved it!!
tt14482414,"I stopped this movie after watching the 3rd episode. The movie was just funny but too slow and boring, you could find yourself easily being distracted while watching this movie. However, I appreciate the director took the badminton games for this sport genre. Just try again."
tt14482414,"Just finished the last episodes, and I must said this drama impressed me. Despite filming in a pandemic, the show still able to bring healing time to me. Playing badminton myself, this show had able to teach people about badminton, the sport and competitions, as well as the athletes who playing it. I understand where the reviews came from, but if you have time, gave this drama a chance. Truly a healing for me ^^~"
tt14482414,"Decent, and it get boring every episode!I don't recommend you to watch it..."
tt14482414,"Just like a very bad adapted version from Reply 1988. Similarity in the plot and in the lines. ""This is the first time of my being mom"" The same from Reply 1988. I know they both have the same scriptwriter but please at least make it unique. Moreover, soooooo unrealistic. None of the cast make me interested. Instead, all of them are wayyy too much. Especially the father. Though I am a fan of Reply series, cant stand this. I dont like the girls at all.1/10 for the plot. And the rest are 0/10. I stopped at the 4th episode."
tt14482414,"It's an oversaturated manufactured cheap emotional bait that lacked the genuine human connection and necessary depth but rather opted out for easily digestible cliches. Most of the cast, especially the younger ones, were desperately overacting in an attempt to translate the youth energy to screen but it came off as fake most of the time. The actual sports scenes were average at best, it's themed around the sport but not the sport itself. Most scenes with a sweaty face, the sweat looked as fake as it can be. It's so damn laughable that some scenes the neck was sweaty but the face was perfectly dry! The cast didn't do a good job in showing the physical exhaustion of performing the sport whether it was while training or competing. Again, making the sports scenes even more fake. What's up with the drama trying so hard to pair every boy with a girl? Really unnecessary. This drama would have fared infinitely better as a standalone one-off movie. The drama really highlighted the ""bad"" in badminton. Going into this I had the slightest tiniest bits of hope to get something that can be remotely and ever so slightly similar to ""Ping Pong the Animation"" but I quickly realized within a few minutes it wouldn't be the case."
tt14482414,"One of the best K drama's! From cast to storyline! I love it! Can't wait for the rest of the episodes.It made me cry, laugh and wanting to smash the tv!LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!"
tt14916746,"Positives: great concept, great SFX makeup (seriously, what talent!) and funny narrator who, while commenting too often, has some unique jokes that actually land.That's it for the positives. The biggest issue with this show is that it entirely defeats it's own self-proclaimed purpose by making everyone attractive. Every single time someone's face is revealed, the narrator, the other contestants, all think they're hot anyway. They're all conventionally attractive, so what's the point? It's a show telling you not to be shallow while being incredibly shallow. Average people don't want to watch models preach about inner beauty.The pacing is terrible. At the expense of wanting to show off as many designs as possible, the pacing suffers. Changing contestants every single episode doesn't allow time to get invested. If you want to show off more makeup designs, make it a Bachelorette style show with more contestants to choose from instead of cycling through people like tissues.The editing, the rapid cuts, the constant jokes, the shots of them dancing or posing every 5 minutes is agonizing. We get it, they're wacky and wearing funny makeup. The entire show doesn't have to be vapid to get that point across. Just another good concept ruined by absolutely no genuine emotion or sense of vulnerability."
tt14916746,The official reviews noted all the contestants were very attractive. I didnt think this was the case although all the contestants clearly thought themselves that they were very attractive. I found after two episodes the gimmick of the masks started to wear off and the contestants tiring. The lack of depth to their personalities and strange body language became boring. Also strange no follow up on the successful matches. We dont know did they see each other again etc. Bubble gum tv.
tt14916746,"The show is fun to watch, I'll give them that. But I hoped they would choose average/normal individuals to participate in the show. Maybe someone with not so perfect teeth, or super toned body and glowing skin. I would have also liked to see gay and lesbian people.The episodes are short, doesn't really give you time to get to know anybody, which is sad because you're really curious. The reveal is fun, I like trying to guess what they'd look like and let me tell you, 80% of the time I was WRONG. LolI recommend it if you're bored, but lower your expectations."
tt14916746,"I get the concept and the social experiment (same as love is blind)... Can you call for someone without knowing how they look.1. Everyone is attractive
2. It's edited into snippets. You never really get to know anyone so you don't care who they pick or why
3. It's boring.. You'd think a show which is practically Love is Bling and The Masked singer combined would keep your interest
4. Most of the ""best"" are super annoying .. Like I was literally getting bothered watching it.Maybe you'll like it but it's a Big NO for me!I do like how it's ppl from the states and across the pond. That part was pretty cool."
tt14916746,"For starters, everyone is beautiful - so it completely falls flat on the concept of whether or not love is blind. It's also HIGHLY edited and still incredibly cringe - nearly all the participants have absolutely zero charisma it makes it very hard to watch. Honestly just avoid this piece of garbage all together."
tt14916746,"If this show was done exactly the same but with actual people not NYC and London nightlife models, it would actually be worth something."
tt14916746,"Sexy Beasts is a sobering reminder of just how out-of-touch major production companies have gotten. From the way these ungodly images are presented, you can glean that nobody on staff thought to ask: ""Wait, isn't this 'fun game show' starting to resemble the kind of nightmarish furry sh-t people on Twitter will put the Annihilation soundtrack over?"" Even if someone did raise this question, they are no longer working in TV or streaming.This show also plays like the sort of thing you'd see in a cynical parody. I know I say this about almost everything that gets made in mainstream entertainment today, but this one specifically feels like a rejected gag from one of the Interdimensional Cable episodes of Rick and Morty.Indeed, I could totally see myself joking about a reality show of this caliber back in 2010 (the height of the popularity of Jersey Shore at my school and the year I truly understood the gravity of how stupid we've gotten) where instead of ""Big Brother-Tyler"" or ""Paradise Hotel-Steve"" or whatever, my schoolmates would speculate about the future of such figures as James the Beaver, Ibrahim the Wolf, and Nina the Dolphin. Fitting the bill, Sexy Beasts is basically First Dates as mixed with a Guillermo del Toro film (though a Del Toro film would better understand what sort of tone is best suited for these monstrosities, yet also have far nicer themes about monstrosity - and love).In the show, people are put in admittedly decent monster makeup and sent on blind dates with other masked persons. The show aims to test whether we've moved past our primal shallowness and can fall in love with each other based on personality - if the contestants do, they're usually rewarded with the revelation that the TV personality they fell for was really conventionally attractive the whole time. (This is classic Beauty and the Beast, but I'm also reminded of that one Ctrl+Alt+Del comic where a woman pretends to be fat in order to ""test"" her date and the ""happy ending"" reveals that she was thin all along, ergo our poor, poor protagonist doesn't actually need to suffer the ordeal of loving an ""ugly"" human being.)The final product is unacceptably boring, given the sort of visuals we're treated to, and hardly very romantic. Perhaps if we'd seen more of each beastly pairing, but I guess even the showrunners realize that there's only so much time we can reasonably devote to bland hotties going on dates - Pan's Labyrinth-style grotesqueries or not.Despite its unintentional eeriness and kinda dumb concept, however, Sexy Beasts is, at the end of the day, nowhere near the most rancid thing reality TV has given us - in fact, it's damn near impossible to top the bottoms in this particular genre (Honey Boo Boo, Born in the Wild, et al.). Yes, it plays like someone hurled darts at a dartboard filled with random words and ideas in order to find something even remotely original to add to the world of reality television, but the fact that there was an attempt puts it above most of its genre peers.Some of my friends who watch reality shows, to their credit, don't do it because they sincerely idolize or care about the dating lives of Holothurian-brained TV celebs, but because they think of it as going to the zoo (made more literal by shows like Sexy Beasts, I guess) and studying the behaviors of our most brainless specimens. However, I think there is another level of curiosity to this experiment:Think of the fact that there exists a reality show (a full-blown franchise, even) called Big Brother, its title most surely a reference to George Orwell's 1984, wherein impossible-to-deactivate ""telescreens"" existed in every household to feed the citizens information. Think of the fact that people not only started purchasing such devices on purpose (including pocket-sized ones that seem able to monitor the user, not unlike Orwell's vision of the TV) but also began accepting whatever braindead tripe rises to popularity because it's being aired on Fridays and everyone else at school is talking about it - even when its title (accidentally or not) evokes a dystopia of groupthink and TV mind-control.This, to me, says more about the human race than watching some of its members behave in such-and-such way when pitted against other conventionally attractive sponge-brains in projects like Paradise Hotel, Ex on the Beach, Love Island, Paradise Beach, Love Hotel, Ex on the Island, Beach Island Hotel, Big Brother Uganda, or whatever else we've all agreed to consume. And keep this in mind, before you leave this post thinking I'm some pretentious know-it-all (which I am) who's totally above it all (which I'm not): ""We're all puppets, I'm just a puppet who can see the strings""."
tt14916746,"I had fun and quite a few laughs watching this. And I am picky with comedies and reality shows. But I find this unpretentious little show funnier, more endearing and more suspenseful than many other dating shows available (like The Circle, Too hot to handle, and other stuff I couldn't watch for more than five minutes). I do agree with the reviewer that complained about the excess of flashy filler scenes of contestants dancing in front of a light. Instead of that, the show could let us know contestants a little bit more. Also, I wish some episodes would feature other age ranges. Not sure if older people would be up for it though. And LGBTQIA+ people as well. With those tweaks I would definitely watch a second season."
tt14916746,"OMG what a dreadful show! This has been done before in a much better way ""Love is Blind"" that show was believable and well produced.This show is a bad joke from the ridiculous stupid masks/ prosthetics the competitors wore to the settings .I can only imagine the idiot that thought this up as a good idea!The concept of being attracted by a persons personality before any visual attraction is not the problem but the way they decided to achieve it is so cringe and awful it is stupid!Love is Blind is by far a superior production and credible my advice watch that and forget Sexy Beasts the worst show ever."
tt14916746,"Sexy Beasts is one of many dating reality shows to recently come out of Netflix. The premise is a new twist on an old premise--contestants come on the show and are transformed by Hollywood makeup artists into either cartoon characters or animals so that their physical looks are completely obscured. They go on dates to see whether they become attracted to each other without knowing their date's physical appearance, one contestant usually chooses among three candidates who vie for the title ""Sexy Beast"". Then there is a reveal so that the contestant can see if he/she made a good choice.Sexy Beasts is definitely trashy entertainment, and I must admit that I tend to watch these shows only for that purpose. In level of quality, it is about equal to other Netflix entries like Love is Blind and Too Hot to Handle, but I want to give a small positive shout-out to this show for one specific reason: Sexy Beasts attempts to satirize this genre a bit, first with the ridiculous costumes and also with an especially snarky and sarcastic narrator who is actually pretty funny. Since there is so much to make fun of in these shows, I heartily approve this effort. Thus, I find this show more entertaining than most in the genre, and if you do not make the mistake of taking the show at all seriously, you might as well. This is a silly show, redeemed by the fact that it is actually a bit funny."
tt14916746,Utter balderdash. Watched the first episode then skipped quickly through the rest. Fantastic prosthetics. So two stars. Pretty vapid people. Sorry folks none of you are going to meet your life partner on this chunk of cheese.
tt14916746,"Mixing the best parts of the Bachelorette/Bachelor, Blind Date and Face/Off, they get it all done in like 20 minutes. I can't stop binging this show. Personality and chemistry are the only things you can go on, humor is very noticable, and character flaws, shallowness and personality defects are obvious with nothing to hide behind. Why aren't you watching this show already?"
tt14916746,"Husband and I found this hidden gem and it helped make our night fun with the silliness of the outfits, the quips of the host, and the personalities of the cast. Recommended for a lighthearted, entertaining at home couch date."
tt14916746,I don't understand the point of all the choppy editing and flashing shots of contestants dancing around in front of lights. It is so visually busy and irritating.
tt14916746,"I thought I'd waste some time watching this and can truly say that this show is mind numbingly dull and very predictable. No matter how much they pretend to ""get to know each other"" after the makeup and prosthetics come off the contestants revert back to their very superficial and shallow selves."
tt14916746,"It was a good concept but the contestants were shallower than a tea spoon full of water.. They chose good looking people, well most of the times anyway, but did you really pay attention to their personalities when interviewing them??? Booooooring!"
tt14916746,Really? Creative team for this needs to not quit their day jobs. Stick to slinking fries. Essentially one joke repeated over and over.
tt14916746,"Most of the entertainment of this goofy show is in the make-up, which I think is really well-done. The amusement comes from the ""contestants"" being silly in these costumes, and the only real hook is in the reveal upon seeing the contestants out-of-costume. Other than that the content doesn't really match the premise, as all the contestants are very attractive."
tt14916746,"Most people on this show come off as shallow and flawed, wich does make it a bit interesting. But the editeing and everything beyond that makes it quite boring.4/10: nah."
tt14916746,"Very unique concept. So much effort has been put on the makeup and the amazing location selections. Well shot, amazing music and edits."
tt14916746,"It was okay, interesting and creative. Huge fan of the masks/looks, so kudos to the design and make up departments. The execution of the reality series was great and the contestants or casts were great as well. Diverse casts or contestants, it will be great if there were more representations like indian, muslim or at least lgbtq+. Great voiceover / narrator for the reality show. Some of the casts were really toxic and some were really nice which i love the inclusion all kinds of people. It was great. You can feel the emotions as well as the frustrations of the contestants. Good for family. So recommended."
tt14916746,"Tried the first episode, juste to know if this was a nice Reality show to watch when i'm bored... well, I prefer to be bored ans use this time otherwise.Everything seems to be fake and does not look like a reality show at all..."
tt1259571,"Okay here it is, New Moon is not unwatchable (thought some parts come close). Twilight was a bit better mostly cause it had some direction. This one is severely unfocused, with a plot that denies motivation and has lazy acting across the board...well not quite.New Moon may have one edge over its predecessor which is that Taylor Launter puts more into the game than Rob Pattinson. At times, it feels like Jacob may be the better match for Bella. Their interaction which takes up the majority of the movie in fact, feels less broody than the Bella/Edward connection. Unfotunately, around the beginning of the third act we grow out of Jacob almost as fast as we grow into him. Wheras Edward is quite blatantly shy, Jacob by contrast is angry. The reasons for this however seem largely unjustified by the story. Like all bad stories, this one advances by making up its own rules on the spot, resulting in a movie that makes very little sense.I'm truly not sure what it is about the Twilight saga that demands such a plastic style of acting. Why is everyone so lazy about this? it actually degrades the quality of the material. If this is the kind of Romantic chemistry that sells on the market (a chemistry where two people act like kissing is more pain than pleasure) then Romance itself could be a dying genre.But perhaps that is an overstatement. New Moon gave me something to watch on TV when there was nothing else on, I wouldn't recommend it for any other purpose."
tt1259571,"We've all dealt with unrequited love before, but ""New Moon,"" the second installment in the popular ""Twilight"" series, takes it to a whole new level. Bella Swan, the moody high school student who found herself in love with a vampire - the brooding Edward - in the first film, now finds herself attracted to a werewolf, her long-haired Native American childhood pal turned cropped-haired, muscle-bound super-hunk, Jacob. Now, that's a love triangle you don't come across every day of the week.This disappointing, time-marking follow-up to the flawed but often imaginative ""Twilight"" is a tedious, slow-moving bore, consisting of little more than endless conversations about which of Bella's two ""monstrous"" beaus loves her the more and which is more likely to protect her from the danger posed by his rival and the assorted associates and kinsmen who come with him. In fact, so focused is the story on the romantic travails of the three main characters that the movie ultimately stalls out in a puddle of its own sappiness. And on a purely technical level, even the CGI werewolves are not as impressive as we'd expect them to be, given the massive amount of cash clearly lavished on the project.Actually, the thing that strikes one the most about ""New Moon"" is just how much of a rehash it is of the previous film, with Bella's predicament simply being played over, only this time with a lover from a different species (especially as Edward voluntarily removes himself from much of the action this time around).Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson return as the human/vampire lovers, while Lautner gets to run around with his shirt off a good deal of the time (despite the damp, rainy climate). That may be enough to keep the movie's targeted audience of teenaged girls awake and glued to the screen for the duration, but the rest of us will have no trouble snoozing our way through to the next installment."
tt1259571,"I loved the Twilight movie, that's how I started reading the books in the first place. I've read them about ten times each and I still like them. But New Moon's big screen adaptation was a huge let down.One thing that was improved was that many of the characters actually smiled or laughed naturally when the moment called for it, as opposed to the ""I don't crack a smile cause I'm a seriously deadly vampire"" routine in Twilight.I liked the portrayal of Alice, she seemed more like what she should be according to the book, Charlie and I also liked the wolves and the rest of the special effects.But I couldn't feel the bond between Edward and Bella. I couldn't believe that they loved each other. Hell, I couldn't believe they even liked each other. Even at the end, after their ordeal, after deciding that they would never let each other go, they were frigid. The actors just delivered their lines, they didn't feel them. The score ranged from awful to non-existent. It seems as though it was not written specifically for New Moon. Carter Burwell's score brings to memory specific scenes in Twilight. This one is an indifferent, generic one, I guess it would fit in whatever movie you threw it in.However, the most important flaw was that the entire movie seemed very rushed, like it was originally supposed to be much longer but somebody edited it heavily and really, really badly. For example, in an instant we are informed that Edward is going to commit suicide thinking Bella's dead, she drives off with Alice *bang* next thing you know you see a plane in the air, *bang* next thing you know Alice and Bella are already inside the stolen car on their way to Volterra and it carries on like that until the end.No character development, no bonds between them, no space to breathe, no explanation whatsoever of how things happened or how decisions were made, nothing but a hastily chopped up summary of the book.Is the actual movie coming out any time soon?"
tt1259571,"What would you do, if a wolf should fall for you, when rejected by your lover, spending months under the covers, he wants more than to be friends, an outstretched paw he's keen to lend, scratch his back and he'll scratch yours, just be careful of those jaws, as the lupine are not supine, and returns from certain bloodlines, can increase the curdling pressure, and then you may just need a tether."
tt1259571,"I too expected this movie to be better. I read the 4 books. The thing is they cut out the best lines from the books which can add SO much to the movies. I was looking forward to some seens in the movie: Edward proposal for Bella, when they talk while they are waiting to get out the Volturi, very romantic and whilte they are in plane going back home. I think the scenarist must be replaced or the writer should oversee the script. The only reason movies are hit cause of the books only. Most people who did not read the books did not like the movies. Hope they'll do better in the 3rd one. But I really hope they'll do much much better in the 4th movie cause this is the book I'd like most. In general, if you read the books you must watch the movies, its nice to have the characters & seens a life."
tt1259571,"Ahh, what a fickle bunch Twilight fans are. I remember the release of the first film last year, and the incredible backlash from fans of the series--can't even remember the number of comments saying ""Stick to the book!"" Incredible liberties were taken with the plot (or did we all forget the butchering of the much-beloved meadow scene in the first movie?), and too much of Hardwicke's own film-making style was imposed upon a story that was not hers to fiddle with.Then New Moon comes out. Obviously, the screenwriter and director went to great lengths to painstakingly recreate the second book in film form, undoubtedly due to the response to Twilight. I am hard-pressed to think of any really pivotal plot points that were excluded from this film (and, no, the flights to and from Italy don't qualify as ""pivotal""). But suddenly fans come out in droves to complain on the Internet that the dialogue is cheesy? Hello, have you READ the books? Any actor is going to choke on the ridiculous dialogue that Stephenie Meyer came up with (I doubt even Robert De Niro could sell that tripe). Her dialogue only sounds remotely reasonable on the page. At least this movie didn't include such horrendous lines as ""I hated you for making me want you so much""). And people saying it's slow? Again, take a look at the book--the vast majority of the story is devoted to Bella moping over the imaginary hole in her chest. It wasn't exactly an action-packed thrill ride.I for one thought this movie was a vast improvement over the first, primarily because it stayed so true to the book. And Weitz, unlike Hardwicke, wasn't itching to impose his own style on the story by using crazy camera angles and other weird stylistic elements that were nowhere suggested in the pages of Twilight. New Moon was fittingly glossy and stylistically neutral, appealing to a wider range of tastes. It was filmed beautifully and, to my great relief, had a much wider color palette than the first film.As for the acting--let's face it, Kristen's never going to be an impressive performer until she realizes that scoffing doesn't qualify as ""emoting."" And Rob just seems flat-out wrong for this role, but I think he did tap into Edward's inner turmoil better than in Twilight. I thought the performances were, overall, a huge improvement over the first film, especially from Taylor, who fits the sunshiney role of Jacob to a T. The Cullens were, yes, sadly underutilized, but making the movie longer just to give them more screen time isn't going to appease complaints about it being boring and slow as it is.Hopefully this film will get the credit it deserves after the initial tsunami of unreasonable outrage. It's obvious that the filmmakers are trying incredibly hard to please the fans of the book by staying closer to the text. Here's hoping they don't throw up their hands in frustration upon discovering that loyalty to the book is apparently not good enough either."
tt1259571,I honestly cannot understand the low ratings. It's just a great movie. 🙏💚
tt1259571,"Admittedly I have only in the last 2 days watched Twilight and New Moon and I am totally baffled by the popularity of these movies. Especially New Moon this film was TERRIBLE. Taylor Lautner cannot act to save himself, yet next to Kirsten Stewart and Robert Pattinson he looked like he had the talent of Catherine Hepburn. Now, about the acting.... Kirsten Stewart has one face and that is the ""semi-sad"" look. For the most part ot simply looked like she couldn't wait for the film to be over. Robert Pattinson has one face and that is also the ""semi-sad"" look. I think he may be this decades answer to Luke Perry. There was a valid reason that the period between 90210 and Twilight had no ""Luke Perry types"". They can't act!! I fail to see the appeal. Taylor Lautner constantly does that thing where it looks like he is gazing about 20 metres away trying to read micro-printed reading cards and his lines come out accordingly. And did it bother anyone else that Bella is just so accepting of the fact that vampires and werewoves exist???Now I know these are movies made to be aimed at teens and tweens, but for crying out loud at least TRY and make a decent film. There are Werewolves and Vampires present. Shouldn't there be epic battles and much blood lust?? Here are a few points that came to mind: 1) Twilight refers to the beginning of the evening between sunset and dusk and when Vampires and Werewolves get ready to come out to play. They ARE NOT daywalkers. If the characters are daywalkers then ""twilight"" is a pointless time of the day and had no reference to the story..... 2) Calling a movie New Moon where you introduce werewolves into the story would be OK, if the ""moon"" had anything to do with their ability to turn. Having them as daywalkers as I stated in point 1 defeats the purpose altogether. You may as well have called the story ""Cheesecake"", such was the relevance. (Mmmmmm Cheesecake).... 3) Vampires and Werewolves are creatures of legend and not a bunch of sorry ass ""Emo"" teens. They are vicious and bloodthirsty, not whiny and desperate. Perhaps Stephanie Meyers has them confused with Waaah-wolves and Vam-criers? Yes?........I am yet to watch Eclipse but it will need to be a vast improvement on New Moon because it was possibly the worst sequel ever....and yes I am including Police Academies 2 through 7!!! A very generous 4/10 at best."
tt1259571,"There's a point in ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"", where our heroine Bella Swan (Kristin Stewart) and a friend emerge from a movie theater, and her friend begins to rant about how she hates the zombie sub-genre of horror, and then preaches about how she thinks it's silly and lame that a particular zombie movie (George Romero's classic ""Dawn of the Dead"", though it's never mentioned by name, you know that's what they're referring to) preaches about consumerism. At this point, I angrily pointed my finger at the screen and uttered some words I cannot repeat here. It's not that they were making fun of ""Dawn of the Dead""- that's fine. The problem is that this film is a glaring example of squandered potential and storytelling, and it's downright offensive that they should say anything about a film considered to be a classic, by both horror and general audiences alike.This film, directed by Chris Weitz, is a sequel to ""Twilight"", based on the popular novels by Stephanie Meyer. People who read my ""Twilight"" review know I actually thought it was decent. So I turned this one on a few days ago expecting another (somewhat) pleasant surprise.When I first watched ""Twilight"", I expected a mess. I was actually taken by how well the film worked. It had a lot of problems, and I only gave it a slightly above average 6 out of 10, but it wasn't bad...This was bad.We begin with Bella (Kristin Stewart again an enormous bore), who has grown worried about her future with vampire squeeze Edward- she is having nightmares about growing old, while he remains trapped in the body of a teenager, and she fears one day, he won't want her anymore.On her 18th birthday, she visits Edward (Robert Pattinson, who this time around, doesn't seem to be taking his role seriously, and just reads his lines flatly) and his adoptive family. However, when one of Edward's siblings attacks Bella from a sudden fit of his vampiric instincts, Edward decides it's too dangerous for him to continue to see Bella, and he vanishes, leaving her.Bella spends months pining and sobbing for her lost love, but finds a new romance with Jacob (Taylor Lautner). Things finally start looking up for her, when suddenly Jacob disappears, and all hope seems lost. Finally, she reconnects with Jacob and learns that he has become a werewolf, and similar to Edward, he feels it too dangerous to remain with her. She also begins to see ghostly depictions of Edward appear around her, trying to keep her safe from the dangers of everyday life. And soon some strange events unfold, forcing Bella to confront both of her lost loves, decide if she's strong enough to pursue them, and ultimately, see if she's strong enough to save several lives- her own included.The film does have some promises. The whole notion of the Romeo and Juliet-esque romance is interesting, some of the characters are likable, and there are some nice twists and turns through the story. Also, the direction was a lot better this time (Weitz does a much better job illustrating the visuals than Catherine Hardwicke did in the first film), and the music was fabulous.But there are just too many problems in this entry, and it's really just a checklist of what NOT to do in a sequel.For starters, the film is outlandishly boring. Running at 130 minutes, it felt like twice that. The story unfolds at a snail's pace, and absolutely nothing happened for the first hour. Everything seemed slow. It was a chore to watch. And the kicker? Anytime anything actually started to happen... the scene cuts. I'm not kidding, during the first big ""action"" sequence where two werewolves go at it (about halfway through the movie), we only get about 15 seconds of fighting, before we abruptly cut to the next scene- we don't actually get to see the fight, we just cut to another scene altogether. This happens repeatedly. Whenever something happens that promises to move us forward, we simply cut away to another scene. What?! This movie is a horrible tease.Secondly, the writing (courtesy of both the novel and the script by Melisa Rosenberg) was painful. Nevermind some lines and scenes that are quite misogynistic, but also, the dialog is outstandingly soap-opera-ish. Edward never speaks without dripping off cheese (""Bella, you breathing is my gift!""), Bella spends her time spewing revoltingly pretentious and clichéd dialog, Jacob is basically a compilation of every corny ""bad boy"" ever, etc. Also, the film has no structure. As I said above, it takes almost a full hour for anything to happen. And once the plot picks up, the pace quickens to a marathon speed, and too much happens. We are also given a number of plot lines that don't make sense and don't go anywhere (such as new villain Victoria who appears all of twice in the whole movie and never does anything... at all.), and enough plot holes to sink a ship. It was just too darned sloppy.In addition, the humor is juvenile, the action is too brief (the climactic battle is cool, but over within seconds), there is no romance in the film (which is odd because this is a romance movie!), the editing is all over the map, the secondary characters are not developed... It felt like the first half of a larger story, with no climax. It was all establishment, and no pay-off.Even the things that worked in the first movie are ignored.I really am disappointed. I was expecting something that was at least decent, but this was just a waste of time, effort and potential. It is essentially a series of stitched-together sequences that don't contribute to an overall plot. There was no substance.I have to give this a 3 out of 10."
tt1259571,"Have to say, New Moon the most anticipated romance tale of the year, is decently made. So allow me, a non-fan of the series to make this comment.First off, I know people hated it for what it is. The whole idea is like a coming-of-age story of several abnormal kids. I know it's a homage to Shakespeare; and I definitely noticed the similarity with Underworld series it began to show. But I also have to say that sometimes people hate it because they assume it's stupid, and despised the puppy love illustrated in such a fantasy scenario. But, it's the film-making that grabbed my attention.Throughout, New Moon demonstrates with superb pacing, sophisticated art design that overflowing with the whole story, and smooth special visual effects that well fit in. For a standard Hollywood production it should be like this, but allow me to say it adds points to the whole experience. It's not a movie you'd expect an awful lot of actions in it, but believe me you will see plenty of compelling actions that keep you entertained if not delighted. Some scenes are like TV-commercials, but allow me to say they are a lot more beautiful and more genuine than those outrageous built-in advertisements in ""2012"" or so.The other aspect I'd like to give a nod, is the professional attitude of the whole production. The story is about a bunch of teenagers, but the movie never fell amateurish or video-game-like. The actors all fit into their roles naturally, and again allow me to say there was not anything in performances amateurish or in-genuine enough to distract me from the story. Of course the movie is not Oscar-level, but it successfully captured the youngsters' ignorance, arrogance and all kinds of struggles between immaturity and responsibility. Shouldn't we be a bit more open to teenagers? I am not saying this movie is perfect in doing politics right, but it's not bad for a family ride that can make chances for some family talk.So, 7/10 is a fair score given the movie is not Oscar stuff, but admit it that so many people just gave it a 1 even before they see it."
tt1259571,"Similar to the videos of my mom getting ready in the morning, throughout the entirety of this masterful film, it was quite difficult to keep my hands off my peen. I am a straight white male, but after seeing Taylor Lautner so many times without a shirt in the rain I've gotta make some personal changes. The makeup on Edward through the entire film was just pristine and really made me question my decision to drop out of clown college. To say the least, this masterpiece is pure boner fuel and nothing less. At the end of the day, I'm ready to make my transition and be the vampire that Edward always needed."
tt1259571,"Ironically in ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella (Kristen Stewart) watch a movie of ""Romeo and Juliet"". Edward eloquently recites a passage from Shakespeare when called upon by his English teacher. Like ""Romeo and Juliet"" what had made ""Twilight"" so captivating the first time around was the star-crossed romance of Edward and Bella—vampire and mortal. So why does Edward (charismatic Pattinson) disappear during the prolonged middle of the movie? Instead we suffer through shredded Werewolf boy Jacob (Taylor Lautner) and rebounding Bella (Stewart), who have absolutely no chemistry. Granted Lautner bulked up and looks amazing, but he and Stewart have no sparks and this falls completely flat. Pattinson and Stewart have a genuine visceral chemistry which over comes much of the narrative misgivings and often time awkward dialog. Forgoing that for a good hour of the movie is puzzling. It seems like the movie is shooting itself in the foot.Perhaps, Director Chris Weitz (who replaced Catherine Hardwicke) and Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg are too beholding to the Stephanie Meyer's novel. I never read the ""Twilight"" series novels, but I am guessing this is the case. ""New Moon"" is awful. More precisely it is a horrendous miscalculation, and disappointment. I really liked ""Twilight"" which had a great Gothic romance; about heroes fighting great evil. Here the romance is displaced by the plot line, and the battle between good and powerful evil is ambiguous. Perhaps, again we are just catching Act II of the 5 Act play. None the less, this is not a satisfying experience. Pattinson and Stewart do their best, and almost salvage. However, here they are overwhelmed by the story.As ""New Moon"" opens Bella celebrates her 18th Birthday. She loves Edward, but fears what happens when she grows old, while he remains forever young. Edward confides to Bella, ""It's my job to protect you."" Bella's birthday celebration at the Cullen's turns horribly wrong, as Jasper (eerie Jackson Rathbone) nearly goes native vampire on Bella, who accidentally sheds her blood. Convinced his being with Bella will do her harm, Edward tells her, ""You're my only reason to stay alive."" He leaves for Italy to the Volturi—Vampire Royalty. He tells Bella, ""This is the last time you will ever see me."" Distraught Bella falls into depression suffering debilitating nightmares. Edward only appears as Jedi-like ghost attempting to protect his beloved. Slowly Bella pursues a relationship with childhood friend Jacob (Lautner). Jacob himself is going through a transformation—becoming a Werewolf. Recall that Vampire and Werewolves are immortal enemies. New hero Jacob becomes Bella's protector from vengeful vampire. Soon like Edward, Jacob fears he too may inadvertently harm Bella. Bella is forever in love with Edward, and she and his sister Alice (spirited Ashley Green) fly off to rescue Edward, who may be sacrificing his life to the Volturi.There is neither compelling dramatic arc in ""New Moon"" nor any vanquishing of great evil. This is really disappointing given some of the amazing performances. Michael Sheen manifests a dark presence as Volturi leader Aro. Dakota Fanning is chilling as powerful vampire Jane. Kristen Stewart authentically embodies the anguish and wonder of teenager Bella. Pattinson is powerful and charismatic, but isn't on the screen nearly enough. ""New Moon"" is an unfortunate miscalculation that may correct itself in the next go round. At least one would think so."
tt1259571,"I think this movie needed to be directed and edited by a woman because at no point could I sink into the emotions between characters. Woman love emotional stuff. But this just gave a dry account of the events, instead of developing believable characters.Not sure how the characters were portrayed in the books, but in this movie Bella and Edward were really annoying - I found myself rolling my eyes and making fun during many scenes. I found their relationship really depressing and unempowering. Instead of showing deep love, it just seemed like an unhealthy co-dependent relationship.The movie had nice filming and imagery (cool red cloaks in Italy). And I loved all the werewolf men - needed more werewolf scenes.So for the next film - slow it down. Think of what young women like: they like romantic words and feelings between characters so they can swoon and talk about with their friends. Women value the subtleties of characters, not a sports-desk rundown of a sequence of events."
tt1259571,"People who liked either the first movie or the New Moon book will probably have a great time at this movie. People who didn't like them still might have fun laughing at the moments of glorious teenaged awkwardness--Michael Welch returns as the hilariously down-on-his-luck Mike Newton.As a sequel, New Moon is excellent. It maintains the same tone as the first movie, smooths out some of the rough edges and builds from there. On its own it's mostly quite enjoyable to watch. There were lots of intentional and unintentional humor and of course the movie takes only a bit of the edge off the book's more than slightly unbalanced story structure.Things that impressed me? FIGHT SCENES. They actually let us see Felix toss Edward around like a rag doll. And they might have robbed us of the sight of spooky elder vampires petrifying in their old age, but they did let us see Edward's head literally crack like an eggshell as he gets slammed into the floor tiles.I also like that they expanded Alice's role and showed Bella actually missing someone in addition to Edward. I really wish that both the books and movies had gotten more into the Bella-Alice friendship. Also, the idea that a person's spouse is the only relationship they need is a relatively new one. If even a romantically obsessed book series like Twilight can focus on the fact that Bella is reacting to the entire Cullen clan and not just Edward, then maybe we're moving toward a healthier idea of what love is.Also, Michael Sheen is the champion of creepy. Sorry, Bill Nighy; he played Aro before you played Greyback! My final recommendation? Go see this movie with a big crowd for all the squealing and shouting at the screen. It's like a floor show but with body glitter."
tt1242530,"I saw this movie at it's Toronto International Film Festival premier. Having watched the hilarious promos, I was very excited.For the few who don't know the plot, I'll give a brief outline. Yogesh Patel (Harman) is a MBA student at the University of Chicago. He is supposed to inherit his maternal grandfather's wealth once he gets married. In order to pay back his brother's huge debt he is forced by his family to get married and being the emotionally sensitive that he is, he gives in to his family's plead. He then decides to see 12 girls (all played by Priyanka Chopra), one from each Rashee (sun sign) in 10 days and decide the one he likes the most.Okay, now to the actors. Each of the 12 characters's stories are unique and well detailed. Priyanka does a fantastic job at playing each role to perfection, well almost, there are some hiccups here and there. But, one has to really commend her growth as an actress. Harman was okay and still showed signs of immaturity as an actor. Though it was big improvement from the horrendous Love Story 2050. The movie is 192 minutes long and you can feel it. Ashutosh really needs to make his movies shorter. The direction otherwise is top-class. The THIRTEEN songs are not that bad, but nowhere close to the expectations one would set for an A-list movie. I personally only liked the title track.What let's it down is the storyline. The story gets slightly boring at times but it picks up and manages to keep you hooked and laughing for 180 minutes. It's what happens in the last 10 minutes is what ruined it, the ending is one of the worst I have ever seen. They build up such a suspense through out the move and it is perfectly poised for a big climax... and nothing. It ends in a lull.I definitely recommend the movie for Priyanka's hilarious and outstanding performance and romantic comedy fans will surely love it. But, it was definitely not worth the $45 I spent on the premier, I would have preferred waiting for a week and watched it for 1/4th the price."
tt1242530,"Ashutosh Gowariker has become a brand over the years, he has made milestones like 'Lagaan', 'Swades' & 'Jodhaa Akbar'. Expectations are bound to be there, reading his name creates a excitement in a cine-lover, and I being his die-hard went & watched his latest outing 'What's Your Raashee?'. Sadly, The Ace Filmmaker misses the bus this time! On the whole 'What's Your Raashee?' is long, boring and complicated. Accomplished filmmaker Ashutosh Gowariker disappoints big time with his latest outing. Plus, the excessive running time will prove to be a major disadvantage. 13 good songs {though they appear very boring in the film}, good performances & decent camera-work can't save, when a tacky screenplay is aside. As a fan of Gowariker, I am hugely disappointed. The Academy-Award-Nominated Filmmaker makes his weakest fare in 'What's Your Raashee?'.Pluses: The first hr, to an extend is entertaining. Music by Sohail Sen is fantastic; but looks forced in the film completely. Camera-work is decent. Performances are good: Priyanka is remarkable. She plays the very first character & the part of the doctor exceedingly well. Harman is likable. Darshan Jariwala is superb, so are Anjan Shrivastav, Dilip Joshi & Rajesh Vivek.Minuses: The screenplay. The film is very very lengthy, and the songs are a major bore. In fact if some songs were deleted, the movie could've been a bit better. Plus, the Darshan Jariwala-Anjan Shrivastav-Rajesh Vivek track seems forced.Let's hope that the next time Ashu returns as the captain of the ship, he makes a hell of a good film."
tt1242530,"How many of you were waiting for this one from Gowariker? i know many! Sadly for all Gowariker fans, What's Your Rashee is absolutely disappointing. Based on Madhu Rye's novel Kimball Ravenswood, WYR's script is as flat as it can possibly get. What's Your Rashee's story revolves around Yogesh Patel(Harman Bhaweja) an MBA student studying in Chicago, who is forced to return to India after receiving a message about his father's deteriorating health. On reaching India is when the family of Yogesh let out the actual reason. Yogesh is then told about the share scam committed by his brother and the family's huge debt. He's also told about the solution offered by a astrologer according to whom, If Yogesh gets married on the 20th, huge wealth is to follow the family on the very day. He's given a mere 10 days to decide a girl and get married. It does not take long for his family to convince Yogesh and he's then out looking for brides. After a lot of confusion about the brides shortlisted by his uncle, Yogesh comes up with a bizarre idea of meeting one girl from each of the 12 zodiac signs. And the plot leading upto Yogesh deciding his soul mate among the 12 is for you to watch it yourself. Gowariker seems to have failed miserably with WYR provided the quality of movies that hemade previously. The movie fails to take off and the plot of the movie does not really convince you at any level. The one and the only thing that is impressive with WYR is Priyanka Chopra's impeccable performance playing 12 different characters. She's absolutely mind blowing with each of the 12 characters and probably the only thing that makes you sit right through the exhausting 3 hours 15 minutes. Harman Bhaweja is good and tries his best to make an impact with his honest acting supported well by rest of the cast. The funnier parts that were supposed to be funny are not funny and it just frustrates you more. The music by Sohail Sen is ordinary and the 12 songs used for 12 the different characters are not impressive either. Reviewed By- Raghav RamaiahOriginally Posted at talkingpopcorns.com"
tt1242530,"Looking at the project as a whole, I had my doubts on whether Ashutosh will be able to create the same magic with Harman Baweja, as he previously did with Hrithik Roshan in the role of an unimaginable Akbar. With a shaky subject in hand and mediocre songs on air, I was not sure of another polished product from the director with a big stature in the Industry. And all my doubts proved right as ""What's Your Rashee"" came out to be just a below average movie with an unbearable long length, not so impressive content and many unwanted ordinary songs.Said to be based on the novel by Madhu Rye, the story (which is quite predictable) moves around a young NRI boy who is here in India to marry a girl within a week. To make a good choice he decides to meet a girl from each sun sign and then take a decision. Unfortunately, the interesting idea, fails completely in its uninspiring screen adaptation. Other than the twelve different girls brilliantly portrayed by Priyanka Chopra, there is no particular scene in the movie to rave about. In fact if you see the movie, ignoring the truth that it has been directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, then you will just take it as a debut project of any budding director and nothing more.The biggest disappointment in the movie is its extra long length and completely uninspiring music. The length is fine when we are watching a movie like ""Lagaan"" or ""Jodha Akbar"", but you cannot make every project close to four hours of duration just for the sake of it. Ashutosh could have easily edited out most of the songs in the movie as they are not anywhere a part of the progressing storyline. The run of the mill soundtrack stands nowhere, if compared to the scores of Gowariker's earlier projects. Yes, he had the great A. R. Rahman on his side in all those musical masterpieces, but there were also good hummable songs in his ""Baazi"" too, which proves that he indeed has a good choice of melodies. Surprisingly in ""What's Your Rashee"" out of more than 12 songs, we don't even have one particular track to stay in our mind except the obvious title number.Apart from its length and music, the monotonous act of seeing girls again and again becomes quite boring and annoying after a while. There is a very silly explanation given about the similar faces of all 12 girls in the start which puts you off straight away. The completely avoidable and poorly written detective angle in the script fails to make an impact. It also does not reach any conclusion since Ashutosh simply forgets about this added sub-plot towards the end and moves on. There is no proper justification given about how & why Harman makes his choice in the climax as everything just gets sorted our very easily and quickly.In few words, it's a Priyanka Chopra movie all the way, where she acts, dances and emotes in 12 different ways in a fantastic manner. Unarguably, it's one of the best performances of her career till date. On the other hand, I really feel sad for Harman Baweja, who is a true hard worker, but still hasn't got the lady luck smiling at him. When it came to Harman's turn, even the man with a midas touch, lost his golden stroke and failed. May be it's all destiny that whatever the boy does, he always gets compared to Hrithik Roshan, because of their naturally similar looks.All other character artists in the movie have simply performed their allotted roles as a duty towards the director. Cinematography serves the purpose well and visual graphics are nice to see on the screen. Especially the graphical presentation of all the sun signs at the start reminded me of the famous James Bond opening credits, known for their brilliant graphics and girls.A few decades back we had a T.V. Serial called ""Mr.Yogi"",where also a young NRI selects few girls to meet before his planned marriage. In each episode he used to meet a new girl from a different family and background. And I still remember, that I enjoyed the T.V. serial many times more than the current ""What's Your Rashee"". In all, a big disappointment from the director who's all last 3 movies, are there in my ""Movies To See Before You Die"" list."
tt1242530,"Okay, I watched this because it was on Netflix's list of films being deleted for instant play. I guess they ran out of server space or something. I'm not that familiar with Bollywood films, but this is not my first one.I'll skip the synopsis. As an American, I found Yogesh's American-ness and Priyanka's (whichever version's) endless chicago references very entertaining. Outside of that, The Pros: 1. Priyanka. If you just want to watch her all day, it's a good movie for that.2. It's actually funny most of the way through, even the awkward bits with the debt and the spying. The parents of Priyankas (Priyanki?) were also very entertaining.3. The music, mostly. There are several good Indian songs, and maybe a couple western style ones that didn't work so well. There's one in there that reminded me of scandanavian metal.4. Dancing. I get that this is the best part of a bollywood film. American movies haven't been up to this since the 1950s.The Cons: 1. Length. At 3+1/2 hours, you have to have a lot of story, and WYR runs out after about 2 hours, like any romantic comedy. Everything about the situation has already been said, and we roll on with less interesting stuff. If it's too long for you, just skip ahead to the Priyanka scenes you're probably watching it for.2. Social Messages. I see a lot of people saying this was a plus, but I felt like the film was hitting me over the head with political correctness. I suspect if I were an Indian I'd be actually offended. It's the movies job to entertain us, not reprogram us.3. Not everything quite works in the story. It misses the opportunity for a play on Priyanka playing all the girls, and plot development threads don't really go anywhere. That in mind, it's okay to skip through them to browse for pure entertainment.Overall it was as substantive as a western romantic comedy, but no more, so light on content, but very entertaining."
tt1242530,"Evry1 criticizes the length of the director's movie, but i have to give him credit fr backing up this vision. With WYR?, the length is not the issue, but weakly adapting this story and the cast not delivering their roles to the extent of being repetitive nd boring. Since a t.v adaptation stretched week after week w.episodes giving ample amount of time for interactions between yogesh patel and 12 women, the length was not the question of why movie doesn't works. Its romantic nd funny w.o having major suspense, the excitement factor works due to kind of women yogesh meets(played by 12 actresses not 1). You don't have to know too much about zodiac signs ,nd whole story is self explanatory why yogesh goes about choosing a girl based on rashees. However, the excitement factor is lost in the '09 movie and leaves little room for a genuine interaction, rather presenting caricatures of character study. Sure, the idea of choosing is not based on looks(that's why 1 actress)but on inner qualities,but movie did focus on looks,style,nd costumes nd it came out to be caricatures. The focus was more on how 1 actress can portray 12 roles to get an award, rather than focusing on interesting stories w.different women. This cud have justified movie's length nd add excitement to make it fun and difficult for the guy."

tt1242530,"""What's Your Rashee"" would make you wonder if he is the same director who wielded the megaphone in ""Lagaan"", ""Swades"" & ""Jodha Akbar"". It wouldn't be no rocket-science to state that the starting point namely the book ""Kimball Revenswood"" by Madhu Rye is the culprit. I would also add another state that translating a book to screen requires a different sensibilities altogether and this was sadly big time missing. And shouldering Priyanka Chopra to breathe life into all the 12- characters was indeed an herculean task. Don't get me wrong but she put an effort into each character more than humanly possible. But it gets inanely boring after a few characters pass by. If twelve different popular actress'es were chosen instead, it would have taken the movie to a different level altogether. Harman Baweja is imprisoned into poor man's Hritik caricature. The length of the movie adds to the woes, especially after 7th Priyanka, the audience wishes to fast-forward to the climax to find who becomes the better-half of Mr. Yogesh Patel.The comedy track was mundane and hardly evokes mirth. Music by Sohail Sen is different but misses the bulls-eye. Good luck next time ASHu. You are a phoenix and will surely rise from ASHes.PS: My mind is still afresh with the spectacular performance of Late Mohan Gokhale who breathed life into Mr. Y I Patel in ""Mr. Yogi"" on good old Doordarshan which has had similar storyline."
tt1242530,"I like all Ashutosh Gowarikar's earlier creations, but when I read the reviews of ""Whats your rashee?"" I decided against watching the movie. It was forcing of my 3 1/2 year old son which made us go to theatre to watch the movie, believe me its an amazing movie. I don't know why critics love to hate good movies, people like Rajeev Masand think themselves to be god and write whatever they want. But once you watch the movie you will see the brilliance.People are hating 12 songs but those songs take movie forward, length of the movie might be long but I didn't get bored for a single second. No character looks out of place. of course critics like to watch some steamy scenes but this movie does not have one hence critics don't like that. Movie progresses so nicely. Priyanka Chopra steals the whole show but without the support of Harman Baweja it wouldn't have been possible.The whole plot seems so convincing. This is a must watch movie. Please don't go on length of the movie and the thought of 12 songs may be stopping you from going to theatre but those 12 songs are short and sweet. I am not a very big fan of Ashutosh Gowarikar, but this movie just blew my mind off. Go watch it now."
tt1242530,"There was lot of concern if this film would succeed because of an unknown actor. The actor is not Hrithik Roshan, but he is well co-ordinated for a debut actor and his acting is mediocre. He is the type of an actor who grows on you as the film unfolds but not strong enough to sustain without a versatile actress like Priyanka Chopra.The funniest was the Anjali character (where she deliberately sticks her upper lip)with a lisping speech,cacophony laugh, the clumsy walk and poor etiquette. The twelve characters, even though have varying backgrounds the acting is of three distinctions-dumb,demure and crazy. There is certain suspense as to the next Raashee carnation would be-same token there is a nonchalant expectation too. The scene where they stare at each other on the balcony is poignant probably the best part. The story is original and unique but the spying part of the story drags the film down to a B-movie-not inline for someone like Gowariker. stature. The movie could have been tight-suffers from poor editing and long drawn out dances. Music is not the calibre of A.R. Rahman-his absence has definitely made a dent in the film. Overhaul this is a good comedy which bashes the NRI and at the same token brings up lot of social injustices."
tt1242530,"Ashutosh Gowariker's What's Your Raashee? is an excruciatingly painful film to watch. For the most part humorless and misguided, the film lumbers along for an unforgivable three-hours-and-thirty minutes, during which even the most patient viewers might contemplate suicide. Harman Baweja stars as Yogesh Patel, an unmarried Gujarati boy working in Chicago, who is desperately summoned home as the last rescue for his debt-ridden family in Mumbai. He will inherit his grandfather's property on marriage, and hence his folks persuade him to tie the knot immediately so they can pay off their loans. Despite his reluctance, Yogesh succumbs to the emotional blackmail and says yes to be married in ten-odd days, after agreeing to meet a dozen prospective brides, one each from the 12 zodiac signs or raashees. Using what is unquestionably an interesting plot device, the director casts Priyanka Chopra as each of the dozen girls. Within the film, however, the resemblance between the prospective brides is justified by using a ridiculous explanation offered by Yogesh's grandfather. The encounters between Yogesh and each of the girls get repetitive soon enough, and the screenplay slips into something of a cyclic mess, with each meeting-scene between boy and girl predictably followed by a song. It takes extremely skilled writing and superlative acting to create 12 distinct characters using the same actor; and while Priyanka Chopra throws herself into the challenge, she is let down by a poor script. Apart from a few characters that stand out because they're sharply written and convincingly performed, most of the girls appear as clones of each other because the only thing separating them is a single quirk and their costume. So you have a gawky small-town college girl, a sexy microbiologist from Kampala, a die-hard romantic raised on the movies, an honest middle-class girl hoping to rebuild her life after a break-up, a dominating businesswoman looking for a contract marriage, a kooky damsel who's convinced she knows Yogesh from a previous birth - and at this point, you still have six girls left to go. As if this story wasn't tiring enough already, Gowariker squeezes in two pointless sub-plots - one about Yogesh's philandering uncle and a detective hired to track his movements; the other about a loan-shark's henchmen stalking Yogesh's brother to return the money he's borrowed from them. The humor in What's Your Raashee is of the broad, juvenile variety, the kind that might amuse six-year-olds. If you survive the film's plodding pace and make it to the final act, you're expecting to be gratified by a smart ending. After all, which girl does Yogesh Patel eventually choose? Prepare to be disappointed by a cop-out climax that clearly indicates the writers had no idea how to clean up this mess they made. In sharp contrast to Madhu Rye's novel, Kimball Ravenswood from which it is adapted, What's Your Raashee is a regressive, old-fashioned picture that suffers on account of too many silly jokes, too many unlikable characters, and way too many songs. Even the references to such social evils as child marriage and dowry are fleeting and appear gratuitous. Despite the earnest efforts of Priyanka Chopra, the actress can't pull off the impossible task of making every single one of these characters a credible, flesh-and-blood person. Truth is, I'm not sure anyone in her place could. Harman Baweja, meanwhile, is endearing in a role that doesn't demand much. Director Ashutosh Gowariker who's delivered compelling dramas previously, appears out of his depth here tackling urban comedy. Like his epic-sized victories, Lagaan and Jodhaa Akbar and even the well-intended, cult-favourite Swades, Gowariker's What's Your Raashee? is unfortunately an epic-sized failure. Here's hoping his next effort will erase the memory of this film forever."
tt1242530,"I think every one have there own choice to watch the movie , but to recommend this movie to other is awful .Movie Worst Thing's .1) 12 Priyanka is not digestive in this movie , If they took 12 different girls in movie then it will look pretty much different .2) Length of movie is 3+ hrs another worst thing.I Really appreciate those who watch this movie in Hall :) , But More surprising Ashutosh Made this Movie after (Lagaan & Swades ) So guys u r mind , don't waste u r money .Songs are good in movie but still not pretty much fit on movie themes only 4 listening is good ."
tt1242530,"There is plenty to criticize about Ashutosh Gowarikar's What's Your Rashee. For instance its infinite length, fact that Harman can't act Saala, some Gujju not so funny dragging sections, but there is one thing that really can't be ignored is Priyanka Chopra on screen in twelve different forms with costume designer working on her wardrobe one after another and mostly handing her almost backless Cholis. Guy is Chicago settled NRI Yogesh (without h) Patel who is being tricked to fly back India (same as in Hadippa second in this week), has a task at this hand. Find a bride in seven days, marry the girl possibly rich and payback the debts of his uncle with dowry and fortune he will be inheriting for writing birthday cards to his rich maternal grandfather. Jetlagged or strained on one insomniac night he picks up a book same as film's title and decides to meet one girl of each rashee (sun sign).He meets one after another caricature girl with distinct trait, a good natured Virgo doctor, a sensuous sagi saadhvi (astrologer), a mysterious Scorpio with passion for modeling, a business hotshot looking for contract marriage and prenup agreement, a minor Gaaon Ki Gori, a Cancerian with a past, a plucky Gemini, odd fish Pieces who believes in reincarnation and soul mate and there are many more. Most of them come with a song-n-dance routine and many are good distracters.Astrology is fascinating stuff. I remember jumping on Goodman's Love sings and Sun signs, parallel cross checking with each girl guy traits I know of. It was fun and sometimes astonishingly interesting read. So does our reputed director of Lagaan and Swades trying reinventing himself with a comedy cum musical succeed? Not really and I am not surprised. There is already a problem with this kind of premise as twelve characters will be fighting for screen time, limiting character developments and lack of coherent story but at the same time it can be funny vignettes quilted together with a common thread. Unfortunately writer-director Ashutosh Gowarikar lacks the comic flair required for this kind of material to pull off an interesting encounters one after another. He seriously needs a good editor who can chop and cut the flab instead of stuffing it with each and everything you shoot (three hours plus for a comedy? come on!). Harman Baweja is as bland and flat as they can get. Leading guy demands charismatic persona that can click with audience as a groom running on stopwatch looking for the perfect bride in game of luck and chance. Gowarikar also can use a new casting- director.So saving grace is Priyanka Chopra with her screen presence keeps it going. Despite limitation of script she survives the challenge and walks out clean from this astro-mess of a story. Honestly I wasn't grossly disappointed as I switched off my brain when found what movie is up to (it took half an hour to introduce Priyanka Chopra). Instead, fancied lying on couch on one of those late nocturnal sleepless nights in front of my TV set with a glass of beer. If you decide to watch it anyway, my advice will be, don't take any of it serious, feel like catching it on tube and you might enjoy it rather than resenting. And watch if for Piggy Chops."
tt1242530,"You can't believe that this movie came from a director who was rising the standard of Indian Cinema with every movie that he made. Lagaan was right on top...Swades got even better...Jodhaa Akbar was epic! Now, Gowariker is probably back to his pre-Lagaan days with this movie that bores u to the core. The major errors in the movie are - 1. Casting Harman Baweja. He is a ridiculous actor, can't even act like he is flirting (don't know how he dated Priyanka Chopra). And his acting is almost always annoying and unacceptable.2. All the 12 roles played by Priyanka Chopra had very less screen time and it was definitely not enough for the audience to absorb. So every time Harman meets a girl of a Raashee, you forget the name and character of the girl of the previous Raashee. In the climax, when Harman says Chandrika or Hansaa, you would keep scratching your head to figure out which girl it is and what her raashee is.3. Music. I am very very sure that the music made a lot of difference, negatively for this movie though. Ashutosh should have just waited for Rahman to get back after Slumdog Millionaire. This new comer is not bad but Rahman could have at least made the movie look a little better. More often than not, Rahman's music covers up poor acting display or poor storyline(for eg- u don't really find a scene romantic because of the acting. Rahman's bgm can make u feel romance in the scene)4. Songs - Too many songs. a song each for each raashee...ashutosh should have done away with the songs and given more screen time for each of the 12 characters of Priyanka Chopra.To put in short, you won't believe even in your funniest dreams that this movie was made by the director of Lagaan, Swades and Jodhaa Akbar."
tt1242530,"The reason why I wrote this tile is, because you won't remember the names of Priyanka in this movie, if the same character comes back in a movie you would be in deli ma that who is she? even if the name is mentioned you keep forgetting the character.Well, that was funny and interesting too.I got nothing to do and this movie was still unwatched so thought why not give it a try but trust me you wont regret.You may say that its too long but its script demand you may feel boring but still you would sit and watch only because it will hold you till the answer is found of what your rashee? well at the end you won't find the answer to whats your rashee but you would find that love returns surprisingly and no one knows (Herman or Priyanka) that they love each other.This movie can either have very good ratings or very bad ratings, the reason I believe is because of screenplay, its too long for regular cinema. Also Herman got nothing much to do except meeting different girls.But I must say all 12 characters are well developed and well differentiated with true meaning and also holding to tradition and culture.One character that touched my heart was 'Hansa' played by Priyanka who loved one guy in neighborhood and he left her, her honesty and loyalty the expression that Priyanka brought in was awesome.Music may be another let down except song 'Shu chhe Shu Chhe' none were impressive.So in all watch it, its a great way to tel about belief, thinking, demand, desire and situation in marriage."
tt1242530,"First of all, WYR is based on a pretty interesting premise - the 12 zodiac signs. It has universal appeal as almost everyone has read their daily horoscope and is familiar with the sun signs. However, the interesting part stops right there and the movie is treated in a very banal manner. Every girl in the zodiac gets a song of her own - quality and brevity suffers as a result. Perhaps a better idea might have been to have just one-verse songs - it would be innovative while not taking away from the film-maker's vision. For some reason Gowariker sticks to the tried and tested. What we end up is a 200-minute movie. I looked up at my watch at least 5 times, and that is never a good sign.... The best thing about the movie is Priyanka Chopra who is able to create 12 distinct characters and essays contrasting roles be it a simple Gujju village girl or an uber-cold professional with relative ease. Harman has his moments especially when he is empathizing with other characters and remains understated. The rest of the cast is real and authentic for the most part and keeps moving the story forward unlike the songs. All in all, WYR had the potential to be a rom-com with small sub-plots - almost a la PG Wodehouse. However, it turns to formula and ends up in the mediocre realm."
tt1242530,"What's your Rashee is a good movie. It is a light hearted film.
The performance of the cast is also good.The only drawback was the number of songs. 13 songs is too much, also these songs made the movie lengthy. It cost this good movie big time.If you have time and nothing to do then you can surely watch WHAT'S YOUR RASHEE. u won't be dissapointed."
tt1242530,"The movie went all around places with useless songs and confused long storyline, Priyanka chopra was at peak of her career when the movie was released and clearly this movie is a bad choice for her. Watching this movie on an OTT platform after 13 years I still feel this movie could be much better!"
tt1242530,"It is time someone put a stop to this trashing of a perfectly fine film that has been crafted with much thought and creativity. Is the movie very long? Yes, it is and SO WHAT? This may not be Oscar material, but Priyanka shines in every single role she dons, and Harman is a neat foil to her with his gentlemanly persona and apt acting (he too has come under very unfair criticism, our ""superstars"" would have looked out of place as Yogesh Patel).The music is superlative, since the movie was to take 13 songs, Sohail Sen has made a real effort to make each not just melodious but also very contextual. ""Bikhri Bikhri"" is superbly composed, its inspiring lyrics (Javed Akhtar) have been ably handled. The title song, a Jazz number, with which the movie opens is mesmerizing. ""Aaja Lehraate"" has been on the music channels and gives Harman enough scope to showcase his dancing skills.Now the story, it is not meant to be taken too literally and too seriously, although almost every character that Priyanka plays has something to say about the society we live in; nothing too preachy but yes it does make you think a bit. The most touching are the Priyanka who admits to having had an affair and the Priyanka who is tutored to act Western but is too clumsy to pass as such. The comedy does not have the people falling off their chairs in desperate throes of howling laughter, but it certainly puts a smile on most faces.Gowarikar has done a good job, instead of asking for edits I would say he should have made WYR I and WYR II, each two-hour long, both released within a space of 3 months. At least people would have stopped complaining about its length! Let us for once appreciate something that dares to be different and is yet entertaining."
tt1242530,"Gem of A Movie, Don't know why the low rating, Agreed the movie was a little bit long in Running, but was the need of the hour, Such Good Performances by both lead actors. Harman could have been the next Big thing for Indian Romantic Cinema, But Alas, Worth Recommending even, After 13 years of it's Theatrical release. GO FOR IT."
tt1242530,"The lead actor needs serious acting lessons, he might have the looks, somewhat the dance moves too. But his acting is a mess and very hard to stomach. This movie rests solely on the lead actress, which is seriously impressive. The story is not bad at all with minor tackles of serious issues like child marriage. A very enjoyable movie if you are willing to ignore the previously mentioned let downs. I wonder though how much research was put in actual personalities of each rashee. A lot of the characteristics were missing that are hallmarks of each horoscope personality. Again Priyanka did a phenomenal job, while Mr Baweja failed."
tt1242530,"I've been following the films made by Ashutosh Gowariker, who has helmed huge epics and worked with the biggest names in Bollywood today, such as Lagaan with Amir Khan, Swades with Shah Rukh Khan, and his previous film Jodhaa Akbar starring Hrithik Roshan and Ashwarya Rai Bachchan. And it's a fact that his films have runtimes of about 3.5 hours, which goes by real quickly as he keeps the story engaging, and the production values for this films are nothing less than magnificent. So naturally my interest was piqued as the auteur has now turned his sights on a romantic comedy, and I wonder exactly how a filmmaker such as he would be able to tackle this mass-appeal genre.Based on the novel ""Kimbali Ravenswood"" by Madhu Rye, What's Your Rashee? (or translated as star sign for the English speaking audience) has all the ingredients that would allow for the runtime to stretch to a typical Gowariker length, but that's only because the challenge is to present all 12 female characters representing their respective star signs with attempts at equal runtime for each, with a song being inserted during the whirlwind courtship, clocking 13 tunes when the typical production averages 5. Think of it as an extreme speed dating where we get to know the opposite sex in some detail, with some travelling involved as the production showcased different districts in Mumbai, which of course is an eye-opener for one who has never visited India, yet.The story's actually nothing sophisticated, and by romantic comedy standards quite predictable at times. Basically Yogesh Patel (Harman Buweja), an Non-Resident Indian living in Chicago has been summoned back to India because his parents learnt of his multi-million dollar inheritance from his grandfather should he get married, and the family now needs that kind of money to pay off his brother's debts. He reluctantly agrees of course, and sets himself up to meet initially hundreds of girls, but inspiration struck and he decided that he should be 12, one maiden under each star sign.The main draw of the film is of course actress Priyanka Chopra, who has taken on possibly her most challenging film to date, playing 12 characters with more than 12 personalities. Why I say this is because some of her characters are putting on a facade, thus allowing more room for Priyanka to showcase her acting chops, which she did, with the help of stylists decking her out in beautiful dresses, varying make up, wigs, contact lenses and prosthetics even. That's only the physical outlook – you would be amazed at the physical presentation at how chameleon-like this ex-Miss World can be – and she takes her roles on with gusto to make you feel with some, laugh at some, and endear towards some through some wonderful pieces of acting. Not to mention that she broke the record set by Kamal Hassan, who tackled 10 characters in his movie Dasavatharam.Unfortunately for Harman Baweja, who's in need for a booster to his fledging career after the flop Love Story 2050 (which incidentally also co-starred Priyanka), and the lacklustre Victory, his role as Yogesh, quite obsessed with doing the right thing each time, finds himself constantly upstaged and overshadowed by Priyanka's performance. It's a little pity of course, given that if it's anyone who can help him it'll likely be Gowariker given the director's strengths, but this was not to be as it's pretty much the leading lady's vehicle. But that's not to mean that Gowariker's film here is without flaws. Amongst his works to date, I feel that this was perhaps the weakest of the lot, suffering from a number of subplots which provided nothing more than a distraction to the meat of the story, such as that involving the infidelity of his uncle and marriage-consultant (Darshan Zariwala), and that of the loansharks who pop up now and then for unnecessary comic relief.However, its strengths more than compensated for its drawbacks, such as how Priyanka just ran with her opportunities to shine, 12 times. The story also provided some insights into how arranged marriages, with dowries and all, are still conducted and quite a cultural thing, and the plights that some family face with having too many daughters, and wondering how best to have them married off. As the encounters with the different women were rather stand- alone, each allowed for the examination of traits and characteristics that will make you love, or loathe, and generally applies across the board, which allows you to identify with such instances.But for all its narrative twists in secrets that cannot be kept, for its fleeting discussions on honesty or lack thereof, what I enjoyed most was the quasi-explanation of why the females that Yogesh meets, all share a striking resemblance with one another, which other characters don't seem to agree with, but only to the male protagonist. I liked how it was mentioned that we all have this preconceived idea of how our soul mate would preferably look like, and from then we tend to project this thought onto whomever we think would have a chance with, or at least tend to take those physical bits into consideration, only for their inner character, when revealed, to be anything but adhering to our dreams.What's Your Raashee? for the romantic in me, worked wonders, and will leave you guessing at the end just who Yogesh would end up with, since Gowariker deliberately kept you hanging in suspense for as long as he possibly could. I'd recommend it as a date movie anytime if you're looking for something different from the usual Hollywood fare. Just remember to empty your bladders before the show starts, or you'll have to plan to hit the loo just about the time Leo gets introduced, for that inbuilt intermission."
tt1392744,"Well it seems like Dance movies are the rage these days, and this week alone we have two films that seemingly centers on dance, with Jump coming from China/Hong Kong, and Chance Pe Dance from Bollywood, both being romantic comedies appealing to their respective distinct demographics. And it's not too surprising that unlike dance films of old where there's a male-female pair who would exhibit some signature moves on the dance floor, the contemporary films this week have absolutely none of that, which in some ways is a pity.Chance Pe Dance follows recent Bollywood films such as Luck Pe Chance in having their characters lament about the open secret of their film industry, where one has to be well connected, or come from an influential family in the industry in order to have one's big break served on a silver platter. For the rest of the mortals aspiring for that opportunity, it's more hard work, toil and sweat in order to get noticed, otherwise it's an endless cycle of mundane work to pay the bills, and juggling auditions in between.Shahid Kapur plays one such struggler from Delhi, Sameer Behl, who has spent the last 3 plus years trawling the audition houses of Mumbai in order to find work in the film industry. Living under meagre terms, he gets disappointed time and again, which is pretty much against the way he was brought up to believe that his good looks and charisma automatically meant he'd be the hero in his life, all the time. The narrative takes a very whirlwind snapshot of Sameer's life, highlighting his debts and being played out by both his best friend as well as filmmakers who promise him the sky, but never hesitant to pull the rug from under his feet.The story tries to jam pack too many subplots into the film, which makes you wonder whether this is a dance film if at all. First of all, there's the school days arc, where in order to sustain his city living, Sameer takes up a teaching job, imparting his dance skills to pesky children (he's never good with them) in order to help them win their dance competition. The key message here is of course if one couldn't do anything with one's current lifetime, there's always the imparting of skills to the next generation for them to live the dream that we have missed out on. This story arc could have been better fleshed out, other than to be squeezed into the film just before the intermission, and then resolved right after the film resumes.Then there's the continuation of Sameer's own struggle, where he has to learn never to give up because a life-changing opportunity may just be around the corner. In what would be like an American Idol clone of a dance/idol contest, this story too wasn't fleshed out properly and we're taken in for quite the fast tracking from the competition's start, right to the finale, with nary any tension due to the lack of competitive characters, and the larger culprit being the lack of dance (it's chance pe dance after all, right?)But the largest waste here was the under utilization of the character Tina, played by Genelia D'Souza, a choreographer whom Sameer serendipitously meets, and falls in love with. The character reminded me of Asin's Kalpana from Ghajini, the free-spirited, strong girl who teaches a thing or two to her guy about what it means by being resilient. I thought Genelia looked like Asin too from certain angles, and possessed the same vivacity here as well, together with some really stunning dance moves that we would see at the start of the film, with so much promise that when the lead duo gets paired together, sparks will fly and magic will happen. But it didn't! If there's anything to rue about, it's precisely this missed opportunity to have the duo perform a lot more dance numbers than one which quite sedately celebrates their love for each other, by mucking around exotic locales.For a dance movie, I wouldn't doubt that Bollywood cannot pull one off, given the musical like quality in almost all of the films, but it's a real pity that Chance Pe Dance is not that film. Thankfully the leads have charisma and share pitch perfect chemistry together, which managed to carry the film through from start to end, limited dance moves notwithstanding."
tt1392744,To cut it straight as everyone knows the movie didn't get good reviews but take my word the movie is not as bad as people think.. Loads of struggler movies have been made and you have heard the same story over and over again but where lies the difference?? The answer is the moments!! Yes watch for its moments and the passion which Shahid injects into the role...Ken Ghosh who set the box office on fire with his Ishq Vishq this time slips due to his not-so-new script.. The only thing which earned the movie some respect was Shahid's unmatched performance! His dance sequences are superb and choreographed by Marty Kudelka who has choreographed stars like Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson.. The irony is that despite having four music directors in the movie the music is not so great and you don't even remember the count of the songs after you watch the movie!! Genelia as usual is OK! Parikshat Sahni is the new Dad of Bollywood and Mohnish Behl was satisfactory and the children of his dance class were surprisingly charming!! But the standout performance was from Shahid whose struggling act and honest expressions make you smile!! If you wondering what to extract from this review then watch the movie for its fun moments and of course Shahid and his dance.. It will make you smile!!
tt1392744,the movie was not hyped to start with so we can say its no big deal that it will not be a blockbuster as all the genres don't want to watch it well after seeing the movie one would be satisfied if hes a dancelike because the dance steps and the choreography is top notch although the songs are not as good as one would have liked them to be As far as the acting are concerned shah id was great and genial la was so-so but was looking cute\now other characters of the movie settled in their respective role not perfectly but to an extent of watching them till a point my verdict 6/10
tt1392744,"It's obvious to have huge expectations from a musical movie, directed by Ken Ghosh, who is known as one of the pioneer directors of music videos in India. And the hopes even rise further if the project has the youthful Shahid Kapoor (post 'Kaminey') and the energetic Genelia D'Souza (after 'Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na') as its lead couple. Hence, everyone was eager to see a spectacular show with probably a novel storyline accompanied by some brilliant dance sequences, melodious songs, amazing picturisations and tender love moments between the young couple on the screen. But surprisingly, Ken comes up with a very poorly written, confused and un-inspiring movie as his third directorial venture after ""Fida"" & ""Ishq Vishq"".Right from the start, ""Chance Pe Dance"" fails to grab your attention as it straight away opens with a song coming from no-where. Even the titles begin after the song gets over, so there is no explanation why the song was there in the first place. Secondly, just after 15 minutes into the movie, a normal movie-lover can easily guess its complete storyline till the end and that's where the movie loses its main ground of the expected box office success. Based on a routine plot of a struggler coming to Mumbai, with hopes of making it big, ""Chance Pe Dance"" has got nothing to stand out as its merit, apart from the spirited performance of Shahid Kapoor.In other words, Shahid is the only ""Chance"" for the movie to impress its viewers and I sincerely doubt he alone would be able to save it. The flick has several serious issues in its execution, which forcibly restrict it to be called as a below average project. Here they are for your consideration:1. The moment a song starts in the movie, it shifts to a music video mold, which is no doubt the forte of its director Ken Ghosh. Though the songs are indeed a treat to watch, but it seems Ken worked more hard on the songs and less on his story.2. The movie has a completely avoidable track of a school and its students winning a dance competition due to their dance teacher Shahid. The sequence, which is highly inspired from ""The School of Rock"" (2003), is not scripted well, gets hurriedly finished and looks like a misfit in the movie.3. A director who can be called as the Master of Music Videos, ideally must have a good ear and incredible music sense. But Ken simply disappoints in this department as he is not able to get any good songs from the otherwise talented singer Adnan Sami. The music of ""Chance Pe Dance"" is a big let-down, especially with a weak finale song at the reality show in the climax.4. It seems that both the writer and director are pretty confused regarding what their lead characters have to do on the screen. Shahid, who is supposed to be an aspiring talented actor, is more interested in showing his dancing skills than the acting. On the other hand, Genelia, who plays a choreographer in the movie, is given no detailed sequence of teaching the dancing steps to anyone. In fact she seems to be more interested in acting, with all her cute mannerisms and doesn't even talk about dance in the movie. Mohnish Behl, is the most confused one, who at first selects Shahid for his movie and then suddenly rejects him, without any reason.5. The most irritating one comes towards the climax, when Shahid is participating in a big channel' reality show in which we are simply not shown any of his competitors. The viewers only get to see Shahid's performance on the stage (that's too a dancing one) and he easily goes on to win the acting contest and becomes a star.In the acting department, Shahid is the only savior in the movie who gives a sincere and spirited performance which shows more of his sensitive and emotional persona. He might be counting a lot on this movie but may not get the desired results at the box office. Genelia as his lover, performs much better than her previous movies. But the cool and pretty girl doesn't get a well written role and thus cannot be blamed for anything. Parikshit Sahni repeats his fatherly act of ""3 Idiots"", but still manages to impress & Vikas Bhalla is a bit loud in his few scenes.In the end, looking at the track record of the talented director Ken Ghosh, one wonders, why he chose this kind of completely predictable subject for his third important movie which also had the most sellable stars at his disposal. Was this the story he was working on, in this long gap of almost 5 years? Or the movie was a victim of an uncontrolled delay without his fault.To sum up, ""Chance Pe Dance"", which was more publicized as a dancing musical, has only few dancing sequences to watch out and no particular song to rave about. The choreography and song picturisation does entertain you at times, but in the absence of some equally good tracks and a novel script, they fail to create a lasting impact."
tt1392744,"After spending 2 hours in the cinema hall digesting this movie, I had decided not to waste even a single extra minute. But then I thought, a few minutes of mine could save a lot of useful hours of a lot of people. In summary, if you have never seen someone selling domestic garbage packed in a shiny box, this is a prime example. UTV must have spent a fortune marketing this absolute disappointment.I gave 3 to this movie. There are loads of reasons, but almost everything about this movie is really bad. The direction, editing, music, nothing has even a glimmer of hope.Shahid Kapur surely doesn't deserve such a waste of a movie after Jab we Met and Kaminey. Genelia is now the 2nd actress in Bwood who has issues speaking the language. At some point, our directors have to understand that the lead actress has to be more than a pretty face. Most disappointing was Mohnish Behl, who I thought for some reason was trying to be like Annu Malik of Indian Idol.Take my suggestion and avoid."
tt1392744,"Chance Pe Dance is only a little over two hours in running time, but feels much longer because the screenplay limps lethargically in no particular direction.Chance Pe Dance is an annoying, exhausting film that entirely fails to entertain. The dance portions here are impressively performed by Shahid Kapoor, but you could interchange each of the sequences and it would make no difference to the final film. Much of the blame for that must by shared by composer Adnan Sami who delivers an uninspired soundtrack of indifferent tunes.Chance Pe Dance doesn't work because you feel no empathy for its protagonist. The film's writers -- if you can call them that, considering there is no script to speak of -- fail to invest even a hint of vulnerability in Sameer. More so, Shahid Kapoor's surface-level performance doesn't help convey the desperation his character's supposedly feeling.The obligatory romantic track between Sameer and an upcoming choreographer (played by Genelia D'souza) is so random, it adds no dimension to the central plot. This is a film without any character arcs, or plot progression. To be honest, Chance Pe Dance is a film that probably started shooting before a script was ever written; a one-line idea that never developed into a complete story."
tt1392744,"I went into this movie looking for a lift of spirits and I was not disappointed. I did not have prior expectations from the actors or the director as I am new to Bollywood movies. The movie is gorgeous in its bright colors, beautiful people, delightful music and dance, and provides a refreshing and enlightening look at Indian modern cinema culture. The story is simple - the basic human drama of the struggle to achieve one's dream, find love, and be recognized by parents and peers for your special gifts. I did not have English subtitles and the flow of the beautiful Indian language interspersed with a bit English was enough to tell me what was happening. Shahid Kapoor was powerful in his beauty and dramatic dancing and his screen presence was delightful at all moments. His co-star Genelia Dsouza was graceful and lovely to watch. This movie did have a bit of everything including the kitchen sink thrown in the plot, but it all works together nicely to produce classic finding-one's-destiny, true love, redemption through the love of children and being true to yourself kind of story. The people who trashed this film I think just didn't get what it is. It is not to be taken as a serious drama. Chance pe Dance is an ice cream cone on a hot day, and stick of cotton candy, a walk through a rose garden in full bloom...a simple delight for the senses, a moment of diversion from troubling times."
tt1392744,"The movie was really really bad. Before entering the Hall, I knew that the plot would be crap, and I kinda knew the story by just watching the trailers, But all I wanted to see is Shahid's dancing. He didn't quite live up to my expectations. I don't really blame him for this. He was NOT used to his fullest. Genelia was great. I liked her acting and her character. The school part was totally unnecessary. Probably used just to fill some gap or spark a chemistry between Shahid and Genelia.In short, please don't waste your time on this flick. I gave it two stars just because I am a fan of Shahid and I liked Genelia's role. Otherwise, it probably doesn't even deserve one."
tt1392744,"""Everyone Deserves A CHANCE !!"" with this view I entered the theatre. To my expectations I found this movie up-to-the-mark.This movie builds an Environment as if we are ourselves in the movie. Storyline is quite touching having a long-lasting impact on viewers. The movie depicts the struggle of the current generation whose talents are suppressed by the influential personalities.We all being a part of this system can feel it ourselves. The movie is a family-entertainer and has hilarious comedy sequences.Ken Ghosh has done a great job on his part. This movie is certainly better than his Directorial debut and creates a milestone in his Career. Acting by Shahid, Genelia and Mohnish Behl(despite his short appearance)were great. Dancing talent of Shahid is an eye-candy to the viewers. ""Pal mein hi"" song enraptures the audience. To sum up this movie is a great entertainer and also gives a great social message. Finallly this movie is a worth watching with numerous memorable moments(especially the South Indian ad by Shahid)so go watch the movie with your family!!"
tt1392744,"I quite liked the film, the best review I read was by subhash jha i recreate below- At one point in this heart warming journey into the life and trials of this Bollywood struggler a kid in the school, where our struggler-hero teaches dancing, wonders how their teacher ji manages to wear such trendy tee-shirts when he lives in a car and has no money for food.""Arrey , those are duplicates of branded tee-shirts, you can get them at Rs 150 on the pavement,"" retorts a know-all kid.That one fleeting moment sums up what Chance Pe Dance strives to squeeze into two-hour of fluid playing-time. The struggle for stardom is done on such a glamorized level of self-actualization so that the audience accepts these liberties for the pleasure of watching good-looking people look presentable in situations where they would otherwise appear unbecoming. On the credit titles we see our struggler-hero prepare for another day of self selling to an unthinking entertainment industry, when one sees a slightly seamless splendour lurking at the heart of this film about a Dilliwallah's struggle to become a star in the Big Bad Bollywood. Clichéd theme? Yup! But sometime some of the most endearing truths of life emerge from situations that work in a direction opposite to the originality. The fact that Shahid plays the struggler helps. It really helps. Here's an enormously watchable actor who can take away the 'acting' from a character and just make you look at what is being said and done on screen without the baggage of his personal life being carried forward. Shahid's character, Samir, in the film is a struggler in all its shades. Samir, has defiantly left for Bollywood while his dad (Parikshat Sahni, endearing) is left wondering why his son needs to be a film hero in the first place (Bollywood). Shahid goes through the predictable grind, but with such extraordinary sincerity and involvement, you suddenly realize the one truth about life's vagaries. Every struggle no matter how similar on the surface is different underneath. Shahid brings out all the shades, nuances and layers in the struggler's inner world without bending the rules of commercial herogiri. This is a far better performance than it outwardly seems. Whether romancing the funny girl-next-door (okay, a few block away)manifesting the disappointments of a struggler who's getting emotionally worn-out waiting for the big moment, or interacting with the kids in school(the director is almost as good with these angels from hell as Shekhar Kapoor in Mr India)Shahid just goes with the flow with a fluidity that goes beyond the dance-floor. Oh, about Shahid's dancing, is there a better dancer in the film industry today? he slim but confident plot moves smoothly on the surface. This one is a rom-com with a pleasing pungent flavour of Mumbai's sorrowful underbelly hidden, but palpable. While Shahid struggles for stardom the narrative glides along at its own even pace seeking out the wannabe star's life as homeless road-dweller who sleeps in his car, and smirks at life's cruelties. There are very few characters in the plot. Satish Shah, Mohnish Behl and Vikas Bhalla who come and go like images seen from a moving train. Director Ken Ghosh keeps the narrative free of complexities beyond the struggler's immediate preoccupations. And that suits the film's moderate temperature just fine. Some moments especially with the kids, exude the warmth like rays of sunshine peeping through a partially open door. Watch the sequence where the kids share their lunch with their famished teacher. Awwwww! Though the choreography is uneven and the climactic dance, a bit of a disappointment, Shahid comfortably keeps us watching the predictable but perky progression of this penniless pilgrim from the backseat of a car to the red-carpet. While giving groovy guru-gyan to his students, our dance teacher, Shahid mentions Michael Jackson , Govinda, Prabhu Deva , Hrithik Roshan and Shiamak Davar among the best dancers. We can easily add Shahid's name to the list."
tt1392744,"Please give this movie a chance. It is really worth watching at least once. Shahid acting is superb. Genelia is looking stunning as always and acting is good too. Please give this movie a chance. Shahid and Genelia have great chemistry in this film. I was surprised that this film would turn out to be this good. Story is really good and its different. Genelia's acting is too good. I think she should do more Hindi films too along with south films. I wish and pray for her that she gets more offers for Hindi films even after marriage and two kids. Shahid has grown in acting really well. He has done superb acting in this film. Please go ahead and give this movie a try, that is all i am asking."
tt1392744,"Well, the storyline is a little cliché, but they made it quite entertaining. To me, it seems to tell the story of anyone who wants to be an actor whether it is in India or in Los Angeles. It has cute girls and boys. And the dance is good, the music is pumped up with energy.Too bad, not many people have seen it. If this movie was made by Hollywood, it could have been very popular, because it has all the elements.Shahid Kapur doesn't look like those Indians I typically see, he looks like a mix, he could easily be mistaken as Italian, Hispanic, etc. His dance moves are good, he has a nice body. No wonder he is so popular in India.I won't mind watching it again just to see those dance sequences."
tt1265990,"The Roommate is one of those films, that when you first the trailer, you think to yourself, ""This is gonna suck"". But only when you actually see the film do you realize that you were only partly wrong. The Roommate's premise is simple enough. A young pretty girl is being stalked and obsessed with by her roommate. The film revolves around Sarah (Minka Kelly) who is on her own, going to college and learning new things. Little does she know that she has a stalker roommate, Rebecca (Leighton Meester). As soon as Rebecca and Sarah become closer to each other, strange events begin to occur. Each of Sarah's close friends or allies becomes hurt, or sometimes even killed. I wonder who could've done this? The good thing about The Roommate is that it is a pretty decent thriller. Even though it doesn't even come close to meeting the standards of a horror movie, it still delivers some chills and even some cheap jump scares. The acting is good as well. With the exception of Minka Kelly. Cam Gigandet delivers a solid sometimes annoying performance as Sarah's new beau. Even though he is not in the film for long, he lifts our spirits when things are going rough, which is pretty much every 10 minutes. But the real scene stealer here is Leighton Meester as the crazed roommate. Meester delivers a believable potent performance, psychotic one moment and sweet the next. The bad things about the film are that in the very beginning it moves far too fast. Jumping from one thing to the next in the blink of an eye. Also, the writing really could've used a makeover. I mean, the dialogue in this film is ridiculous. All in all, the film is at times stupid and the deaths aren't very well executed, if executed at all. But the acting and characters keep you around for the show. Overall, The Roommate is a film I would recommend, but only to open-minded movie watchers."
tt1265990,"It's nice when you're presented with a thriller that the majority of people can relate to. Moving off to college, nervous with jitters, and not knowing who your first college roommate might be. You ask yourself questions like, ""Will my roommate be clean and neat? Will we get along? Will they respect my property? "" It's a role of the dice that doesn't seem too disappointing for most. What most can't relate to is the question ""Is my new roommate a demented psychopath who wants to steal my identity?"" Then finding out it's true. That is the case in this rainbow version of the 1992 classic film 'Single White Female.' The film starts with our main character Sarah Matthews (Minka Kelly) moving into her dorm. Sarah is starting to build relationships with other housemates, but they seem paper-thin. Still in the opening credits the acting starts becoming awkward from introductions that are in no way realistic. If you're shopping at Wal-Mart and someone drives they're shopping cart into yours, I don't think everyone will smile then introduce him or herself happily.After a while we learn Sarah is a design major. Unlike her other classmates she has style something that all the money in the world can't buy according to her Design 101 instructor. Moving along, Sarah goes to a frat party with some of her new friends to get a feel of life away from home without a curfew. She meets a guy whose pick up lines in the real world would come off as lame and stalker like, but for some reason it's acceptable here. After the party, some of the guests are too intoxicated to make it home alone, so they're escorted back to their dorms. This is where we meet the ROOMMATE Rebecca (Leighton Meester.) Rebecca comes across innocent at first with no real reason for you to think otherwise. While the plot centers on Rebecca being obsessed with Sarah wanting to steal her identity, art is one thing they genuinely have in common. So Rebecca can draw art very well and that's all we get to know about her character other than she lives 20 minutes away and her parents are filthy rich and they don't get along. While Sarah and Rebecca are getting acquainted as roommates, Sarah begins to display her particular taste in life and Rebecca is taking mental notes. It feels like a friendship is starting to build until little by little Rebecca starts to mimic Sarah's behavior from illustrations of Sarah's favorite movie to copying her hair color. After a while, like any normal person, Sarah rations her time away with other friends from the college. This is where the s*^# starts to hit the fan. Rebecca of course doesn't like this and starts to become envious of everyone that is taking the time of her so called BFF. Like I said the psychotic behavior is starting to erupt but this is also the main problem of the film.Rebecca is becoming jealous so she starts doing every SHE can think of to gain Sarah's attention again for her own psychotic gain. They range from body mutilation, harassing Rebecca's friends, and harming animals in a way that can't be imagined. I can only count a number of incidents towards Rebecca's insanity and in doing so her actions are left unresolved. There's really no aftermath to any of her behavior except one occasion where she manipulates Sarah's design instructor, but that was completely justified. It does take away from the point of the film. I wanted to be thrilled and turn in my seat, but I hardly moved. So much was left unanswered regarding Rebecca's behavior and back-story that instead of being scary the film turned into a comedy. When individuals lash out it's more entertaining to know where they came from and what exactly sent them over the edge. Jason was drowning while campers had sex, Freddy was burned alive for being a pedophile, and ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" was imprisoned for 13 years for crimes he did not commit. Those were justified. Why is Rebecca so crazy? It's not because her parents didn't love her. We're just told she's bipolar and takes medication. That by the way was brought up so remedial as if it was just saying, ""make sure you guys buckle up, don't want a ticket."" Scene by scene there are attempts to make Rebecca seem more sinister. Instead, I'm screaming, ""GIVE ME MORE!"" and that request is clearly ignored.The climax came out of nowhere and it's build up jumped around like a king on a checkered board. Even so, the acting and reactions of someone trying to harm another person flew out of the window making me rationally clock out of the film. The roommate is barely entertaining and may make you say, ""WOW"" once or twice. The whole time I couldn't think of anything more than, ""If this or this happened, it would've been much more entertaining."" It's something that we have all seen before but a blessing none of us have to go through. There's a bad taste left in my mouth knowing how entertaining this film could have been if it didn't have the tight collar of a PG-13 rating. Not at all a must see in the least bit. There are plenty of films that surpassed this one in a foot race of the same genre leaving this one in last place. With all that being said, IT'S STILL JUST MY OPINION!!! 5/10 - Brandon Keith Avery"
tt1265990,"Wow this movie is bad. The writing is terrible and the acting is not much better than terrible. If you took any kid in school sat them down and told them to write a scary horror movie that is set on a university/college campus this is pretty much what they would come up with exactly. It is very predictable and you can see the attacks coming a mile away. Basically without ruining any of it I can say this is a girl who is obviously stuck with a roommate in college who she does not know but the chick turns out to be completely insane and tries to take over and keeps attacking and scaring her to death, almost literally to death. The movie is so stupid you will laugh at different places but it is not meant to be at all funny so this is just a terrible movie."
tt1265990,"How bad was your college roommate? After Sara (Kelly) meets her new college roommate Rebecca (Meester) she thinks she has found a new friend. When Sara starts to do things without Rebecca strange things begin to happen. Let me first start by saying that this is not a bad movie, but it is definitely geared toward a specific age group, and it's not mine. For the 19-20 year olds this will be very creepy. For the older crowd this is a definite remake of ""Single White Female"", but in my opinion not as good. For those who have not seen that movie this will be very creepy. For those that have seen that movie you will notice the very similar scenes and ideas. Again this is actually not a bad movie, but if I was 10 years younger and a girl this would really scare me. If you are older like me and want to be creeped out by a movie like this one, I'd stick with the original ""Single White Female"". I will say the Leighton Meester, in a departure from her usual roles, did a really great job of playing a creepy stalker. I just could not really get in to this movie. I give it a B-.Would I watch again? - I don't think I would, but it made me want to watch ""Single White Female"" again.*Also Try - Kalamity & Single White Female"
tt1265990,"I went to see this movie expecting a good thriller, but man was I wrong. The opening comes right out of the blue. Its too fast paced. There is barely any storyline structure or memorable performances. NOT scary. NOT suspenseful. Pathetic and infested with forgettable acting. I can't even recommend this movie for a one night rental. The atmosphere is lifeless. The ending is so last minute thinking. The climax????!!? The climax had no ability to impress me. I regret ever spending my money on this disaster piece. There is not one unique thing this movie has to offer. I'll be surprised if anybody mentions this film's name in the future."
tt1265990,"I just saw ""The Roommate"" with my best friend, who is not into scary movies at all. Myself being a Gossip Girl and scary movie buff absolutely had to see this movie. Although this film was not necessarily scary, it was quite... disturbing. Disturbing in the sense that this movie was realistic. Leighton Meester was effective as a stalker obsessed friend from hell, and would have even freaked out Jennifer Jason Leigh. ""The Roommate"" was not gory, or very sexual, but had enough cringes and off putting parts to make you say ""ooooh!"" out loud. my only real issue is most of the best scenes were shown in the trailer, and that by the end i felt sympathetic for Rebecca. all in all ""The Roommate"" is ""Single White Female"" for teens, and is a great PG-13 thriller."
tt1265990,"Lacking in suspense, answers, and any enjoyment from its ""horror"" label it's boasting, The Roommate is easily one of the worst thrillers in recent memory. It provides no backstory or any chemistry from the cast, and manages to drag on for ninety-one minutes. When a movie makes you think a ninety-one minute run time is insufferable, wow is it bad.The Roommate's biggest problem is that it is one big tease. It is stamped with a PG-13 rating, when it could've passed for a PG in 1982. There is a shower scene that is incredibly drawn out, and desperately wants to show below the waist and higher than the stomach but can't. It doesn't want to be racy or good. The makeout scenes could very well win the worst sex award as well.The plot is a girl named Sara (Kelly) is starting College and gets a new dorm. Simple enough. She seems normal; tattoo of her deceased sister on her breast (wouldn't be surprised if when she was having sex with someone they screamed out ""Emily"" by accident), wants to learn, make new friends, simple. Much to her surprise, she returns home from the club to find she has a new roommate named Rebecca (Meester) an uneasy adolescent who becomes increasingly fascinated with her roommate. She begins to go through her things and be very overprotective about her. Then Sara discovers why she is the way she is.My one question to the people behind this - why don't we get backstory on Rebecca? Why doesn't the film focus more on her? She is easily the more interesting one, and when we do find out the secret, we assume more backstory will brew. Negatory. None. We are just as clueless as we were. The minor clue towards the end doesn't help matters, and only turns them into a convoluted barrage of questions.There is an animal murder, and like in Drag Me To Hell, it's horrifying. Why do horror movies these days portray an animal in danger or helplessness? Why do even the crazy harm animals? Let alone why is it incorporated in the film? She could've just let the animal loose and things would still play out the same. Nope. We have to witness another dreadful and upsetting animal murder for no apparent reason.No character in this movie is likable either because no one is developed to that point. The main character's parents aren't even mentioned, or called once in the film. But her dead sister and her ex boyfriend get mentions. Plus I can tell right now Minka Kelly, a beautiful woman, is sporting too much of a Jessica Alba/Megan Fox look. Her hair looks darkened and her lipstick looks like a Fox tribute. Her Alba-like face is natural, obviously. I'm pretty sure she is aware of it too.The Roommate is exactly what is wrong with modern day horror movies. There is no contrived suspense or anything to make this even the slightest bit likable. Even Billy Zane who was good in The Final Destination can't make this miserable mess any better. If had an R rating it may have been a little bit more tolerable, but I'm doubtful on that. It is Fatal Attraction mixed with Single White Female, and it creates a disastrous and lame film.Starring: Leighton Meester, Minka Kelly, Cam Gigandet, Billy Zane, and Alyson Michalka. Directed by: Christian E. Christiansen."
tt1265990,"I wanted to go see The Roommate....I was hoping it wasn't a typical, predictable movie. The acting was good...I think it was believable for the most and the actors a up and coming so it was nice to see a new set of faces. As for a new plot,I don't think so. It a pretty predictable movie, there is nothing new or fantastic about the movie. However its good for what it is which is a teen-thriller flick. There is definitely more that could have been done and it could have been a little more thrilling...to be honest it wasn't that scary! Its not really a horror....it barely classifies as a Thriller. If you want to go see a teen-thriller/psycho movie, this is a good choice however if youare in the mood for a possible Oscar movie or something to blow you away....this is definitely not for you!"
tt1265990,"Movies like this get a bad rap because you know exactly whats going to happen.But this was shot in a film-noir style and didn't resort to being a slasher-esque movie, unknown foreign director christensen builds the suspense up well, there's nothing long winded here and the 90 minute running time is perfectly paced.No harm that all the characters are easy on the eye, and while no-one stood out, there wasn't any cringeworthy or cheesy performances.Its unfair to compare this to other ""obsession"" movies, I feel this film stands out on its own and is a solid thriler much better than the 4.5 rating on here"
tt1265990,"'THE ROOMMATE': Two Stars (Out of Five) New variation on 'SINGLE WHITE FEMALE', this one revolving around two college freshmen living on campus together at ULA. It stars 'GOSSIP GIRL's Leighton Meester as the psycho student and Minka Kelly as the good girl. The film is directed by Christian E. Christiansen and written by first time writer Sonny Mallhi. It's mildly amusing at times but for the most part it's routine and devoid of thrills or any real action.Kelly plays Sara Matthews and Meester plays Rebecca Evans. When the two first meet in the dorm room they've both been given they immediately hit it off. What Sara doesn't realize is that she's made too much of an impression on Rebecca and she quickly becomes obsessed with her. Sara is also troubled by an ex-boyfriend (Matt Lanter) who keeps calling but has met a new love interest in drummer Stephen Morterelli (Cam Gigandet). This doesn't sit well with Rebecca who wants Sara all to herself. Her obsession turns to creepy and dangerous really fast.The film is very light on thrills and violence (for a thriller). The first two thirds of the film actually play out more like a depressing character study drama leaving the viewer feeling more sorry for Rebecca than afraid of her but then of course the end turns to routine third act 'B' movie trash and we finally get some action. Meester is somewhat good as the troubled student and Kelly looks beautiful but for the most part the movie has no real acting to speak of. The dialogue is weak and scares and thrills, like I said, are nearly nonexistent. The movie fails on almost every count but it's still mildly amusing. I give it some credit for not putting me to sleep but it's mostly a waste.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd0S1srQ9T8"
tt1265990,Don't bother seeing this. It's awful.rip off to Single White Female.
tt1265990,"This is a fun but predictable teenage thriller animated by stereotypical characters (obvious exception being the roommate).The movie is kept interesting with the roommate's actions and growing obsession with the main character. Leighton Meester did a great job here, as I ended up feeling sympathy for her character and took her seriously. Unfortunately the movie is only after cheap thrills, don't expect much of a back-story.The biggest flaw of the movie is the pacing. The introductions between the characters are so quick and cheesy that it's hard to care about any of them. It almost felt like the movie just wanted the introduction out of the way so it could get to the main plot as quickly as possible. I think this story would've worked better in a TV show format to allow smoother development. Everything feels so rushed here.The movie is aiming at teenagers and adults, as if saying ""hey come look at these normal college students deal with a crazy bitch"". There is nothing deeper about this movie, but it's still a fun ride."
tt1265990,"This is basically ""Single White Female"" in a college dorm, with less talented actors, and the murdered animal is a tiny black and white kitten instead of a puppy. Ugh. If I could leave no stars, I would."
tt1265990,I literally closed it the moment the kitten got hurt.
tt2246595,"The start scene it self makes it predictable, the new female actress din't deliver the goods and the bad make up on her adds up to it.there's no plot in the film. The songs were okay. Since the movie is shoot in South Africa it makes it a bit watchable. The movie conveys a message, a person becomes successful not by his honesty but by following wrong ways. The movie has not so good action scenes in fact it's lame and foolish. I don't why Bollywood tries to be like Hollywood instead of imitating they should be inspired by them and create something original, because even this movie seems some what like the Hollywood film blood diamond. I would not recommend you to watch this film, since it's a waste of time. I would rate this movie as:4/10"
tt2246595,"Vishesh Films's latest venture is just made out of their own old films and inspirations taken from the West as usual. The subject has no novelty at all ruining every possible excitement to watch it as a new release. Very strangely the promos revealed the entire movie and its storyline which was in fact the most unintelligent step taken for its promotion. The film is only able to hold you for a while in the beginning. But as the plot progresses it really tries to test that how patiently you can watch the same repeated stuff being shown on the screen with some different actors.A middle class family boy, who dreams to be rich living in a big luxurious house, gets a job offer in a foreign country. His lady love is excited too but the good times gradually vanish in thin air as the boy comes to know about the criminal background of its company and the crimes in which he has been involved too unknowingly. Now if you can recall, the same was the basic storyline of Vishesh Film's""JANNAT"" (2008) too with the cricket betting background and to some extent the traces were also there in Mahesh Bhatt's own ""NAAM"" (1986). Talking about the Western influences, a similar storyline can be seen in ""THE FIRM"" released in 1993 revolving around a young lawyer.So, BLOOD MONEY is purely based on the Bhatt set film-making style starting off with a romance and then entering into a criminal zone along with a little sex and few good hummable songs. But at the same time, it strongly indicates to be one of those unimportant movies which are quickly made in-between the other Big money making projects to show some non-profitable expenditure in the firm.In the acting department, all the sincere efforts of the cast including the confident Kunal Khemmu and the natural Amrita Puri (of AISHA fame), go in vain due to the stale & unimpressive subject of the film. Only Manish Chaudhuri is able to leave some kind of impact in the roll of the Boss among the supporting cast & Mia Udeshi is only there to fill in as the sexual attraction of the film. Supported by a fine Cinematography, it readily proves to be a Bhatt camp film due to the few interesting tracks in its soundtrack like Chaahat, Jo Tere Sang & Gunaah, which sadly remain incapable of saving the film from sinking. No doubt, debutant director Vishal Mahadkar brightly shows the talent he has in few sequences like the Diamond Selling scene in its first half. But I really fail to understand that why did he zeroed on to such an overused and uninteresting subject for his debut film. So learning a valuable lesson from BLOOD MONEY, he must give the subject of his film, the most serious thought next time."
tt2246595,"Every great gangster movie has under-currents of human drama. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from ""Blood Money"". This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power.Anybody complaining about the ""cheesiness"" of this film is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire, ironic considering all the gangster rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Kunal Kadam.This isn't Mukesh Bhatt's strongest directorial effort, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled (particularly the memorable finale), but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by Upendra Sidhye. The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Kunal Kadam, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another.Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial.Blood Money is totally worth watching. An essential and accessible gangster flick, and a pop-culture landmark.The story is very detailed and realistic. This film tells a story of how a person who rises to power by wealth can easily be destroyed by the same exact stuff that made them powerful. Also in the middle, he or she become a completely different person and they lose their friends and family.Overall : 8/10"
tt2246595,Good movie to watch for especially the title suggests all that in movie when dreams becomes nightmares and also see comeback of khemu to bhatt camp.
tt2246595,"Blood Money(U/A)-------------Rating:4/5Blood Money is a perfect thriller of a common employee... It deals about a employee meshes in diamond smuggling.... the movie is simple but taken rich in south Africa..... the cast and music was good.....Blood Money - A decent rehashThe film is as 'template ready' as it gets and at times does remind one of 'Jannat'. The difference here though is that while Emraan Hashmi was carrying a negative streak to him for most part of the film, Kunal takes time to loose his righteous side, only to announce a return in a much faster time period.However what one doesn't miss right through the film's narrative is a distinct Bhatt feel to it. One can well see that first time director Vishal Mahadkar has been clearly inspired by Vishesh Films school of movie making and is following the formula that has been consolidated by the likes of Vikram Bhatt and Mohit Suri.What one does miss though is the punch in the affair that stays constant for the entire duration of the film. Let's admit it, 'Blood Money' starts off well and introduction scenes pretty much establish each of the characters well too. There isn't much time wasted by getting the hero and the heroine into a 'naach gaana' mode and the drama stays focused on the 'diamond' business and the nexus involved. Just when one felt that the film would show a massive escalation in the second half, 'Blood Money' gets into a predictable zone due to which one does feel a tad disappointed.For starters, the entire Mia Uyeda and the adultery episode has been done to death in quite a few films, not to mention many films coming from Bhatts themselves. Even 'Crook' had one such episode where the leading lady (Neha Sharma) felt cheated after finding Emraan Hashmi in the arms of an Australian gori. Moreover, even though one did feel that the film was doing well in its realistic zone, the dramatic filmy twists and turns in the second half dilute the impact. Yes, the climax is decent but one still feels that if only more powerful sequences had preceded it, 'Blood Money' may well have turned out to be an even better film.What works for 'Blood Money' though are it's performances. Kunal Khemu, despite being around for quite some time now, still has that raw and innocent charm to him that makes him believable. He fits in well into the part yet again and shows that he can play different characters with ease, case in point being other notable performances in '99', 'Superstar' and 'Kalyug'. Amrita is decent in her limited part and fits in as required. Manish Chaudhary may have started seeming predictable now but one must admit that in the context of 'Blood Money', he plays his part well. Mia is a good eye candy and should bring on 'moolah'.A special mention for the film's music which is just in line with what the doctor (read Bhatts) had ordered. Jeet Ganguly makes a successful comeback into Bollywood arena and is well complimented by Sangeet- Siddharth Haldipur and Pranay.'Blood Money' may not be an excellent film that would go down as one of those small underrated gems of the year. However this film about gems (and diamonds) isn't a bad watch either. Yes, there is deja vu for sure, especially those who have watched films right from the days of 'Naam' to 'The Firm' to 'The Devil's Advocate' to 'Jannat'. However if you are willing to see a film that is a rehash of all these films with some memorable scenes thrown in, chances are you won't mind catching up on 'Blood Money'."
tt2246595,"with unconvincing storyline, lame plot, stupid location set, bad directing and naive acting. furthermore, if you want your audiences/viewers to take your production more seriously, adding the stupid traditional dancing and singing would only make it worse. i strongly suggest that the Hindi movie industries should gradually phase out the traditional and always irrelevant singing and dancing add-ons and tries to distant itself from such shallow, ridiculous, totally pointless but always thought they are a MUST-HAVE in Hindi movies. you can't have it all, my Indian friends, making all the movies always turned out to a Broadway musical is nothing but brainlessly stupid. what made me often feel awkward and clueless when i watched Hindi movies is: if you want us to take you Hindi movies seriously, less dancing and singing would be better, without either would be even better. the problem that i often felt about Hindi movie is when a movie looked just so serious, suddenly, all the characters started dancing and singing, it's just so outrageously out of place, man.this 'blood money' is no exception. it's already quite lame and lukewarm, adding some sudden dancing and singing scenes just looked more stupid. how could i take a further step to look this movie be serious? and those female eye candies in this movie were also unnecessary. Hindi guys in south Africa? give me a break, man."
tt1705952,"The story of Tarzan of the Apes written by Edgar Rice Burroughs had been interpreted in many films since the 1930s. We all remember those classic films starring Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane. In the 1980s, there was an acclaimed film version starring Christopher Lambert and Andie McDowall as the legendary couple. In the 1990s, Disney gave us its own take on the story in its traditional 2D animation with a pop musical score by Phil Collins. I was very surprised that this year, another version was being announced on ads. I saw the name of Kellan Lutz, and thought this was a live action film, starring this Twilight actor who just recently took on another classic film character Hercules. It turns out this was another animated production, but using motion capture technology.This incarnation of Tarzan gives the new generation an updated origin story. There is a comet from outer space that unscrupulous power companies are fighting over as an unlimited energy source. Instead of the shipwreck, we have a helicopter crash this time. The young Greystoke here was already a talking toddler rather than a newborn baby. The whole first hour was rather bland and boring. There was a lot of scenes which were dedicated to the romance between Tarzan and Jane. Only later when the villain character Clayton makes his appearance, it was only then that the action picked up. But by then, we can see that this version of Tarzan was very much influenced by the film ""Avatar"" with its environmental message, the layout of an army of technology, down to the rocky peaks in the setting. A hilarious modern day reference was the presence of a worker who was dressed like Bob the Builder.The quality of animation is not at all bad, to be honest. The story though had already been told so many times, and the modern upgrades were too incredible and too familiarly derivative to accept. This is not essential viewing, only when you have restless kids and nothing else to see at the mall. Only an hour and half long, it will be enough to keep their interest. But afterwards, they will probably still remember the Disney version more."
tt1705952,"Bad plot, awful human animations... in all a waste of my time.Predictable story line you know all the things that will happen before they do. The mix some people are doing on topics is absurd... kind of the Cowboys and Aliens movie !! what a joke and here meteors, extinction of the dinosaurs, and Tarzan?? The other thing that was just enough for me was the gorilla behavior, even they seem to know how to use a knife (and the meaning of it for a kill) and to open a door... truly people?!! This types of movies are a slap to your intellect... please do not waste your time like I did mine, hope producers and writers could give me back the hour I could stand of this nonsense."
tt1705952,"When I heard that there was a new Tarzan animated movie being released I was really quite excited because despite my love of big robots and monsters smashing things up and things going BOOM I do have a soft spot for Tarzan, I have fond childhood memories of running around with a tea towel loin cloth and a potato peeler shouting Ahhhh ah ahhhh!!!!!But this, was poor... Very poor... and a little piece of my childhood feels violated :(So, the animation is like something from an average quality PS3 game cut scene and is the style that I would expect to see on a kids TV show (although the motion capture was put to good use, the poor animation at least moves well).The potentially interesting story was diluted to focus on nothing in particular.There was (in my opinion) totally needless narration at certain points to tell you what was in front of your face.If I didn't know any better I would have said that this was developed to promote a new range of dolls for girls (Jungle Barbie and long haired, loin clothed Ken?).Save your money, watch something else or if you really want to watch an animated Tarzan look to Disney's offering which while being a little more childish trumps this one in EVERY way!"
tt1705952,"Took the family to see Tarzan. 4yr old cried at the sad bit, but got VERY board (FYI to film goers- cinema was very noising from board kids talking, crying, moving around, playing on phones!!!) 11yr thought it was very poor, compared to other animation and the Disney version he grew up on. To quote him, ""why did they bother if they couldn't do it better?"". My misses and I thought the animation kept pulling us away from the film, you cant be immersed into a story if it keeps distracting you. The motion capture just seemed weird; clunky and off putting. Not 100% terrible, but needs a lot more to be worth the £60 we spent on tickets and treats! It's not as if the story is even public domain, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. still hold copyright on Tarzan, so again why did they bother?"
tt1705952,"I have seen this movie today (the German version), and, honestly, I can't understand why this movie is getting such a poor rating on IMDb. Probably it's a misunderstanding: Many reviewers compare it to the Disney-version, and this is obviously nonsense: As it is the case with Disney's ""Jungle Book"", Disney's ""Tarzan"" has hardly any in common with the literary template. Disney's ""Tarzan"" is a movie for kids! This new version ... Well, I am afraid the director & author wasn't quite sure if he wanted to make a movie for kids or for grown-ups; this is one of the problems of this new version. It is certainly a more grown-up-version: There are no talking animals; there are people dying (offscreen, of course), and the mood is generally more somber. Okay, the SciFi-elements were not really necessary, and the evil corporation, yes, that's quite cliché. But all in all this version is much closer to the spirit of the books than the Disney-Version, and having a bit of nonsense in the plot, I think this is okay: There is a lot of nonsense in the books, too. And the animation is quite good; the 3D-effects are well done. If you don't take the plot too serious, you can have fun watching this movie!"
tt1705952,"Mistake 1: Remaking a film that was in league with the Lion King for best Disney movies ever, and had a Phil Collins soundtrackMistake 2: Adding dinosaurs, rare metals, and alien substances to this film Mistake 3: Adding a greedy company as the main antagonist.Mistake 4: making it a 3D film. Seriously? 3D? Mistake 5: Actually spending money on this.I am truly in shock that this even exists. It seems to be a mash-up of Kong, Avatar, Tangled, and Tarzan all mixed together to create this abomination. I am sorry for the company that thought this was a good idea. Way to ruin all that my childhood stood for.On the plus side, the animation is pretty decent."
tt1705952,"Not sure why so many negatives about this version, the 3d was awesome the story was excellent, well paced, not a kiddie movie maybe that was it people wanted a kiddie version. not every animated movie has to be a Pixar or disney!!, watch without prejudice and if you can watch it in 3d please do!!!"
tt1705952,"I'll start by saying that I don't know why this movie is getting such bad reviews. I feel as if many people are comparing this to the Disney version and that's not fair. I say it's not fair, because a lot of people grew up with the Disney version. There was a review where the writer mentioned their childhood. Tarzan is an old story, which has been made into many different movies. Just because Disney Tarzan was part of your childhood, doesn't make it the best necessarily. Having been born in the early 90's myself, yes, I couldn't help but notice the resemblances and differences between this and the Disney version but I came into this telling myself to be open minded. And man, do you need to be open minded for this one. The adding of sci-fi in this probably threw off many people, but I found it interesting. In fact, the one thing that probably annoyed me in this movie was whether or not it was directed to adults or children. It definitely deals with more adult themes but they kept it primarily PG. There were times I wished they crossed that line and made it PG13. The graphics and animation is excellent. There were no musicals like Disney, which I liked. I also liked the humor in this, especially from Jane's character. The movie tugs on some emotions. I found myself saying ""aww"" a few times. Overall, different but enjoyable. I kind of hope they recreate another Disney movie. It'd be nice to have a different take on them given I think they did a good job modernizing this one."
tt1705952,"I would give it 0 / 10.The story has nothing to do with the Tarzan stories. Point 1. The emphasizing that the boy was from an American family.Point 2. The period in which the cartoon is setPoint 3. Sci - Fi element.Point 4. The only thing common to the ""Tarzan"" is the title and that is it. If this cartoon would have any other title, I could buy it. But Tarzan, and one more steeling of a classic story with origins in Europe. This Mercia's trend is becoming down right annoying."
tt1705952,"In general, I really love computer animated movies. Ever since Toy Story, this genre has a huge appeal to me. I still remember rendering my own pictures on my hobby PC in the attic. It was time consuming to create just one image, let alone a whole movie. But ever since Toy Story, there have been good movies (Antz), great movies (Incredibles) and bad ones (Robots), but this particular movie must be one of the worst I've ever seen. As a children's movie it failed. As an adult movie it failed miserably. The character animation is horrible, the sub-plot is far fetched and has nothing to do with the original story. Besides that, the movie is obsolete. It does not add anything to the Tarzan movies we know, being animated or real life.So, my vote is a 2, for the jungle is beautifully animated."
tt1705952,"I watched this movie with friends, and there were a lot of parents bringing their children to watch this, expecting a joyful animated movie.1st. The aura was dark, it's a gloomy animated movie. The plot was so bad and the producer should feel bad. The twist was meh. They all just made no sense.2nd. It's full of scenes where parents will feel the tremendous awkwardness as Tarzan can't put his pervert glare away from Jane, which glare very much welcomed by Jane. And there's the lovey dovey scenes. In Indonesia, scenes which contain teen's caressing between themselves physically are still considered an awkward scene to watch with your kids.3rd. Brace Yourself, Feminists are enraging. Jane is a damsel who is always in distress, where Tarzan always came to help, you know the drill.4th. If you think this movie is going to be even close as the Disney's version, you're gonna have a baaad time.5th. This movie is bad. and i gave three stars was only for my deepest condolences to the team working so hard for this, while having to know that they're making a movie with a lame storyline like this."
tt1705952,"Tarzan is yet another version of this very familiar character. Aside from, perhaps, Sherlock Holmes, he must be the most all-time popular fictional character when it comes to movies. They've made a zillion live action versions as well as the Disney cartoon. However, now a German company has created a CGI version and it's appearing in theaters.It begins with a gorgeous outer space scene showing a giant meteor heading to Earth. However, this is the Earth of millions of years ago, and you see lots of dinosaurs milling aboutand you wonder if perhaps this is NOT Tarzan! However, it's only the prologue and some of this (especially the meteor) comes into the story much later.Much of the film is typical of any Tarzan film. A boy is in the jungle with his parents, they die, he's then raised by gorillas. And, when Jane arrives, again, it's all pretty typical of the Tarzan films. The big difference is the evil corporation angle. A jerk named Clayton is intent on finding some giant meteor (the same one from the beginning of the film) and he's willing to kill Jane, her father, Tarzan and all the cute animals in the film. He's a pretty typical film baddie but the corporate angle is a cliché we've seen a lot in recent years. Aside from the evil corporation, the film is a fairly typical retelling of the story.So is it any good? Well, the story and voice acting are nice. But the film suffers when it comes to the animation. One of the most difficult things to get right with computer generated animation is a realistic human. Sure, cartoony and exaggerated ones are not difficult to make but trying to make a real looking person is tough—and because of that, filmmakers have only recent been trying to make people who look like people. But, all too often these characters come off looking a bit creepy, as the CGI quality is getting a lot better overall but it's still not exactly right with humans. Because this is a commonly understood problem, I am VERY surprised that the German filmmakers who made Tarzan even attempted to make a hyper-realistic computer animated film about this Edgar Rice Burroughs character. And, in hindsight, I don't think this was a great idea, as too often the people in the film just look vaguely creepy. The effect is made worse by the sad fact that the CGI simply isn't close to the quality being made by Pixar, Dreamworks, Fox or Universal. It really has a look like it was made a decade ago—and the film's graphics vary tremendously. The people, leopard and movement of a jeep in the jungle look downright primitive, though some scenes, like the waterfalls and chameleon, look great. It's a real shame, as I am sure it took a lot of work by a lot of people to make this film but the graphics simply aren't up to even a typical made for DVD release—yet this has been released in 3D for the theaters.So, what you have here is a poorly animated but otherwise reasonably entertaining film. I do not strongly recommend it, but you could do worse as far as family films go. But, it probably will bore young kids and older ones will probably just sit there and make comments about the sub-par animation. It's probably one more to rent than to own or take your kids to see in the theater.By the way, it probably was just the problem with the copy I had, but the sound quality was pretty poor—very tinny. But, as I said, I doubt if this is what it will sound like in the theaters. And, in fact, the soundtrack itself is probably the strongest thing about this film—even with sound issues."
tt1705952,"This is a very nice reversion Tarzan movie, I watched almost 2 years ago.It is completely different from the Disney version. The story takes place in modern world, but it also comes with many magical fancy setting. Story line is clear, and 3D CGI is out of ordinary, yet chacter body movement is still stiff. Anyway, still better than many animation designs.By the way, this Tarzen has 6 pack abdomen muscle, super long legs and tiny waistline. Also he has a pair of innocence doge eyes, very cute character image. 🤣Couldn't recall more details, but at least, my impression of the movie is positive."
tt1705952,"I had high hopes that this movie's gonna be a whole lot better than the 1999 version. The story is dull and the there are a bit dragging scenes. The 1999 version still remains to hold the crown. It had a better plot, soundtrack and character selection.But, comparing the 1999 and 2014 version, this one got my vote for graphics and animation. Most scenes appear true to life, especially the jungle, the water, sky, helicopter, meteor and so much more. When shot from a far angle, the humans look real. From skin tone to clothes and hair strands.If you're looking for something worth your money, go get the 1999 version. But if you prefer graphics and animation more than the plot, this one's the film for you."
tt1705952,"people always complaining about the origin of Tarzan. as for me, i'd love to watch some alternate story, just like this.although it has some kind of sci-fi plot, but who cares. at first, like some other guy, i thought that this was a life action because of kellan lutz played a role, but then, ow, this is some CG movie.some people said that the animation are bad, but for me, is not. it has some potential for animated movie which didn't made from Hollywood, as far as i know.in my opinion, don't trust the review too much, and give it a try. perhaps you would enjoy this movie as well as me, because watching movie is not always about plot or something you'd expect."
tt1705952,"Well, dad really got this animated feature not so right. It was an okay animated film for start-ups but where's the flow of plot or story. I can't feel it with this film. I don't feel connected to it, yes there is some music and sound effects but it is not close to even a musical like Disney/Pixar! Good effort though don't get me wrong but it is still not enough to make a cut for a even 5/10...The characters portrayed here are good the visual effects are okay but I still don't feel that I can get into this film unlike Despicable Me 2 or The LEGO movie whereby I can feel it and wanna remember the soundtrack: Everything is awesome as well as wanted to watch it again and again because it is fun and loving and meaningful too. I can be connected to its plot/story and its entertainment. Therefore, I can only rate it at 4.5. But in IMDb rating system, it is from 1 to 10. Unfortunately, gotta give a 4/10 then...Sorry no hard feelings but this is my honest POV..:P"
tt1705952,"If you're looking for realistic animation or suspenseful action, this isn't the movie for you. However, my six year old son will sit through this entire movie. He doesn't sit for long periods of time at all. Great movie for family time."
tt1705952,I loved this story as a young kid so when I saw this coming out I thought that I will take my 6 years old to watch it - I watched the trailer and it was not looking baby-ish which he can't stand... so deal... Unfortunately I had to after that forever explain to my kid that this was not actually the real story and that meteorites and Tarzan have nothing in common... Not very good and truth be told - there would have been a great market for this movie as (already mentioned) it would have called to the kids that have grown out of musical animations if it was representing the story as told by E.R. Burrows. As not the case I would not recommend to anyone. Still gave 6 as animation not bad at all.
tt1705952,"While adaptations of the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs' hero vary in quality, most of them are very entertaining on their own terms. 'Tarzan' fares the weakest quite easily of the lot, there is very little if any Edgar Rice Burroughs in sight but worse is how poorly it fares as a standalone.'Tarzan' is not completely irredeemable. The jungle itself is rendered very handsomely with nice vivid colours, while the music score has the right balance of spirit-rousing energy and whimsy (not so sure about the songs though which seemed like they belonged somewhere else). While the acting was not good at all, Andy Wareham does provide some effectively gruff menace to Tublat in the very little he has to do, while the film finally comes to life in a climax that does have some legitimate tension and urgency.However, the rest of the animation is poor. The characters just look stiff and like they were lifted out of a very low-budget PlayStation 2 game while their facial expressions were either forced (Jane) or lifeless (Tarzan). Very little better can be said about the performances sadly either, there has never been a blander or charisma-free Tarzan than the one of Kellan Lutz, while Trevor St John goes through the motions as the one-dimensional and quite pantomimic Clayton.On the other side of the acting spectrum, there is also Craig Garner's irritatingly whiny younger Tarzan, Spencer Locke's gratingly contrived Jane and Les Bubb over-compensates amateurishly and mugs as Jim Porter. The dialogue is embarrassingly clunky and nearly always sounds awkward, and there was really no need whatsoever for the over-used and over-explanatory narration, which was a classic case of more show, less tell, telling us what we can already see on screen and it got annoying fast.Storytelling was a mess, with a particularly ponderous first hour, an underdeveloped and chemistry-less romance between Tarzan and Jane (an enormous problem when it takes up so much of the film) and the whole convoluted and out-of-place nonsense with the meteorite subplot. It honestly felt like a short film stretched and bloated to suit feature length, and even the gorillas and jungle wildlife felt thrown in and randomly inserted. The characters are little more than vapidly written, one-dimensional and annoying stereotypes.All in all, less than inspired, or even good. Has even less swing than 2016's 'The Legend of Tarzan'. 3/10 Bethany Cox"
tt1705952,"This movie is the same story as all the other Tarzan movies . This one has bad animation and its just one of the worst movies to be made ever since transformers 2 of worse jack and Jill. It's better for the whole world if you just leave the original movies and not make more and more and more. As i mentioned before the bad animation, the animation is as bad as mars needs moms animation but a lot worse. If you remember the old better films and you thought they were good you will hate the Tarzan Movies. Gongraulations for all the 12 Razzies you are going to win. You will replace jack and Jill on the no. 1 spot on IMDBs bottom 100 movies. If you are going to see this movie you will want you money back. Im serious"
tt3202200,"German film schools seem to teach one thing: imagine the most undemanding viewer, take virtually 50 % of its brain away and then make a movie for him. I cannot stand these stupid movies anymore, made in my country. And this is one of them."

The only thing I cannot explain is the close relationship between Jessie and Walter Jr. (Alex) but everything else makes sense. Gus literally has a lab, tuning his horse. Sophia is Hank, expressed in his mannerisms and interactions with Walter White .It all makes to much sense to be only a coincidence and this needs to be examined closer. Still waiting for the Slippin Jimmy adaptation. 10/10 don't regret watching and would so again."

This movie furthermore has nice representation of many cultures, especially loved the Arabs.Story (10/10)
The Story has really good writing, loved the foreshadowing and I really wasn't expecting the plot.Sound (10/10)
This movie contains some of the best songs of the decade, if not of all time.Overall: 10/10

tt3387542,"Upon seeing Jason Zada's ""The Forest,"" I feel like I'm at a point of indifference I have never been at before when it comes to watching and reviewing films. Normally, I emerge from films eager to talk about some aspect, or feel empowered to emphasize details or things in the film I wouldn't have thought general audiences might have noticed themselves. With ""The Forest,"" I emerge with depressingly little to talk about. It's become far too common to kick off a new year with an underwhelming horror film (2012 had ""The Devil Inside,"" 2013 had ""Texas Chainsaw 3D,"" 2014 had ""Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones,"" and 2015 had ""The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death""), and if nothing else, that seems to be the only constant in American cinema alongside with a surefire hurricane of blockbusters starting in May and continuing through July).""The Forest"" is set in the Aokigahara Forest, located in Japan's sacred Mount Fuji. It is a forest that was once known as the place where family members would leave sick, crippled, or disabled loved ones to die during times of famine and war, and in present day, is a popular suicide location. We focus on Sara Price (Natalie Dormer), a young woman who gets a call from the Japanese police telling her that her missing twin sister Jess (also played by Dormer) is dead after she was seen going into the Aokigahara Forest. Knowing her sister all too well, and knowing that she is unstable but not suicidal, Sara commits to flying halfway across the world to try and find her, as a strong part of her believes she is still alive.Sara's belief is only strengthened when she sees that the body discovered is not Jess, leading her to believe that her sister is still somewhere deep in the forest. At a bar one night, she meets an Australian reporter named Aiden (Taylor Kinney), who decides to do a story on her and her quest to find her sister. She tells him how Jess was always the one that looked toward danger, when she turned her head; she recalls when their parents were killed by a drunk driver and how Jess saw the bodies while she closed her eyes. The next morning, the two venture into Aokigahara with a park ranger named Michi (Yukiyoshi Ozawa), in efforts to try and find Jess.The idea of the forest, as explained in very disjointed and vague manners by the locals throughout the course of the film, is that if there is an inkling of sadness in your heart upon entering Aokigahara, it will be exploited through things that you will see in the forest to the point where you'll believe the only way out is suicide. Michi explains to Sara upon entering deep into the woods that anything she sees from here on out is a result of hallucinations and her own mind playing tricks on her. The natural world leaves as soon as you abandon the trail of the forest.""The Forest"" is marginally effective in creating atmosphere, especially during the late night and early morning scenes when the forest becomes less a collection of trees, branches, and leaves and more of an abstract maze. The issue the film has is rooted in the screenplay, penned by Nick Antosca, Sarah Cornwell, and Ben Ketai. In order for the character relationships and the setting to be simultaneously successful, or at the very least harmonious, they need to be equally developed. Initially, the trio of screenwriters do this right by giving Sara enough time before she has to go in the forest to allow her personality to be open to us to get to know. We get to know about her and her sister's backstory after she meets Aiden and we get a hold on their characters quite nicely.The problem is that once Sara, Aiden, and Michi go in the forest, the focus should shift on the forest being the character in the film, which it really isn't. Nothing about this forest feels that eerie, except for the music and the jumpscares we experience when we are immersed into it. The feeling of being trapped in the forest with the characters is there, since there is no cutting to a search party or Sara's fiancé, but there is still no real involvement or characteristic with this forest aside from ropes and the occasionally successful jolt.Because of this, ""The Forest"" grows repetitive, and at the end of it all, we have a conclusion that doesn't answer any of our questions about who Jess is as a person and why she would have wanted to go into these woods in the first place. This is especially frustrating since, from the beginning, Zada and company make it seem like they will develop the story in a manner that's focused on the characters, only to leave the most intriguing soul of the entire film undeveloped in her motivations and her intentions.Well-shot, but lacking sustenance and the graceful blend of character and location, ""The Forest"" is a mediocre horror film, though its PG-13 makes it perfectly acceptable for the middle school/high school crowd to experience a Friday night scare. It's a bit humorous to think that the path the film took is the same the film's characters took upon entering Aokigahara. Instead of following the path that would've keep them safe (the filmmakers keeping both the characters and the location in mind), they took a wrong turn and ended up losing themselves in a sea of unfortunate circumstances."
tt3387542,As far as horror movies goes this one is not bad..The theme of the suicide forest is intriguing.The stranger in a strange land them works well here.the film avoids most of the horror clichés.It has plenty of creepy moments and you'll jump a few times.The production is high and Natalie Dormer gives a good twist on the scream queen ..Her character is not dumb repeating cliché lines and behavior..The questions that run though your head her character answers.The film has a dark ending and is not fairy tale at all..I don't understand why its so poorly rated its not that bad...its a good scary movie.....
tt3387542,"5.5 I would say is right on the money. Not academy material but good for a couple of jump scares. Just saw the movie tonight. First jump scare was so good lady next to me spilled her full bag of popcorn and tipped over her drink...we laughed and laughed...then the usher came.I had the movie pegged to go in another direction but I guess the joke was on me, and everyone I was with thought the movie was going in the same direction I thought, so it was pleasant surprise that it was not that predictable.Overall 5.5 is good, watchable, scary enough. More psychological than it was Horror or Terror.It was a little light on the Horror, and there was 1 single plot line, but still enjoyed it."
tt3387542,"I had my eye on this movie since it came out earlier this year. It was a January release so I was in no rush to see it, but it had a genuinely cool premise: looking for someone in the suicide forest, which is an actual place in Japan where people go to commit suicide. It's pretty unsettling. In the movie, it's said that the forest compels people to kill themselves due to supernatural forces or vengeful spirits. The Forest focuses on Sara, whose sister has gone missing in said forest, and Sara's desperate endeavors to find her sister despite the evidence pointing to her being dead. Up until about the 30-minute mark, I was on board. The pieces were set, the exposition was established, and the characters (Sara, her journalist friend Aiden, and a tour guide) were finally heading into the forest. Again, the atmosphere is creepy throughout. The director clearly has a grasp on how to build tension.The problem is that the promising build ups lead to zero payoffs. There are handful of cheap jump scares, a couple of which admittedly shocked me but only momentarily. Once the initial shock wore off seconds later I was in the same state of mind as before. Effective jump scares linger for a while; they imbue dread and usually add something to the narrative. The jump scares here are your typical, ""Boo! Something's behind you!"", which are easy to shrug off. Also, once they're in the forest, the characters make some decisions that are unfathomably stupid and out-of-character. Like, the main point of the forest is that it makes you think you see things, a psychedelic effect if you will. So after Sara receives this crucial information, she runs after the first thing she sees scurrying around in the forest. While it's pitch black, mind you. It completely takes you out of the movie and makes you lose all empathy for the characters for putting themselves in these avoidable situations. Also, The Forest focuses more on the bond between Sara and her sister than the actual forest. So there are plenty of flashbacks, dream sequences, all that garbage that just muddles the fact that, hey, this forest is really f*cking scary. Why not focus on the forest instead of forcing character development, if you can even call it that? It makes no sense. Also, there's nothing we haven't seen before. People being hung? First scene in Sinister. Claustrophobic underground tunnels? The Descent. The only thing that makes the movie unique is the actual setting which is used as a backdrop more than anything.The acting is good, as is the premise, but the potential littered within this movie is never fully realized. The director can definitely creep you out but he'll need a better script if he wants to make a truly great movie. The Forest just leaves you feeling hollow and disappointed."
tt3387542,"As a whole the movie works and is very satisfying. It's like a joke that seems to have a weak set up that's made up for with a hilarious punchline, but waiting for the punchline to come in a feature film can be dull. It's not like pulling teeth dull or anything like that, It is a good story. It really does not hurt that Natalie Dormer is fun to look at for an hour or two as she plays a woman looking for her twin sister who entered a forest in Japan known to attract those who want to commit suicide and never comes out. For those of you not into Dormer, Taylor Kinney is in it as well as a reporter trying to help, but has his own agenda. If you you don't like either actor that will be a problem cause for the most part it's the two of them in the woods for the majority of the film.It's not as scary or frightening as I hoped for. The disturbing images did the trick, but it did not get my heart jumping like I expected, but it feels like the overall story is what is supposed to haunt you. I get it but I'm not all that impressed."
tt3387542,"Natalie Dormer plays a woman who is searching for her twin sister(also Dormer) who has gone missing in Japan, last seen in a forest where everybody seems to die, but she is determined to find her no matter what, but will she find her, or will the forest drive her insane? The film does have some good scares, and Natalie Dormer does give it her all here. But the story itself feels to cut down, and actors like Taylor Kinney who play it so bland, he just does not have much to work with. The movie tries to hard and it shows, the ending does not leave much to be explained. All in all, it could have been better. Just don't leave much to enjoy all of it."
tt3387542,"An idea can be a powerful thing. Especially when explored well and thoroughly. And indeed a horror-film based around the famous (and infamous) Aokigaha Forest of Japan is a powerful idea, filled to the brim with endless potential for drama and sheer ghostly thrills.The problem is... even a great idea can falter and disappoint when mishandled and when not explored properly. Which is sadly the case with the 2016 horror-flick ""The Forest.""It's a movie with a great idea behind it... that sadly falls just short of being anything special due to an over-reliance on generic jump-scares, abbreviated story development and occasional convolution in its storytelling. And while it's definitely not a terrible film, its inability to elevate itself beyond the level of ""mediocre"" is most definitely its greatest fault. It's neither bad enough to become unintentionally entertaining or be dismissed, yet also not good enough to warrant serious consideration from anyone except the most desperate horror fans looking for a quick-fix of the creeps. It's merely a ""meh"" movie with nothing special to set it apart.The film follows American Sara Price (Natalie Dormer), who is informed that her twin-sister Jess has vanished into Japan's Aokigahara Forst- a vast forest at the base of Mount Fuji, well- known for the numerous suicides to have occurred deep within. Unable to believe her sister is dead due to their deep and complex connection as twins, Sara ventures into the forest with reporter Aiden (Taylor Kinney) in hopes of finding her before the dark forces surrounding them claim her very soul...The fundamental issue with the film is that the idea- an intriguing one- is mishandled. In the hands of a better storyteller, this set- up would hold much promise. But director Jason Zada and the screenwriters seem scared to try anything new beyond ""throw in a few eerie establishing shots and then have something jump out in front of the camera every 10 minutes."" It feels very stock and clichéd with its over-reliance on jump-scares and a distinct lack of atmosphere building in many scenes.Not that I can only blame the director and writers, because it is pretty darned obvious watching the film that there was a fair amount of studio-meddling. Particularly in the first 10 minutes... a prolonged montage of events that clearly were a heavily-abbreviated versions of a much larger sequence, and just stank of ""a producer thought the scene was boring and made them edit it down to a break- neck pace."" (As happens all too often.)That being said, the film isn't a total loss. The storyline definitely has its moments, and its fun trying to figure out where things will end up. Dormer is a charming enough lead. And even though the scares routinely rely on cheap jumps, there is a few genuinely startling moments of atmosphere peppered in that will generate an honest thrill or two. (Including one well-executed sequence involving the body of a hanged man stalking our hero, and a few moments where the characters are completely surrounded by spirits in very fun shots that have a great tone of oppression.) And sue me... I liked the idea behind the ending, even if its execution was a bit too fast. (Though I will not spoil it here.)Overall, ""The Forest"" is nothing more than a middle-of-the-road thriller. I can't recommend it (thank god I didn't have to pay for my ticket), but I also can't NOT recommend it. It's the sort-of film that would be worth checking out on cable or Netflix for free on a slow rainy afternoon. Good for a laugh and maybe a jump or two... but nothing more.I give it a VERY average 5 out of 10. If you're a horror fan and happen to catch it on TV, by all means give it a shot. But don't make it a priority."
tt3387542,"I love scary movies and there are very few newcomer movies that do it right... Lately movies only scare people because of the cheap sound effects and stuff. This one finally gave me goosebumps. Specially at the last seconds of the movie.Great movie, I don't understand why it has so low ratings from the critics. I agree that it's not the best thriller ever made, but it's a good movie in my opinion.As also someone in a review commented if you think about it the movie could have different meanings. Like mental illness. I don't know, you should watch it. It's more a psychological thriller than anything. Just don't except supernatural creatures attacking and killing people, then you'll be let down.Why I didn't give 10 out of 10: 1. It basically rips off from the Vice documentary ""Suicide Forest in Japan"". You can see a yellow tent in the movie too, you have a guide person, you can see other things that look very alike. Of course since it's based on a local story in Japan, but they could have made another creative choices by their own instead of ripping off. Less points for that. 2. There are some things that feel unrealistic in terms of what the actors do, can't write this without spoiling but yeah. Some things could have been better worked out. 3. I got goosebumps and the end, but at the same time it could have a better ending when the movie at times feels a little slow. Would be nice to take some flow pace from the beginning and rather use some extra time for the ending. I'll take this back if this movie gets a sequel though."
tt3387542,"But then again, wouldn't you if your sister was missing? It's a bit of a stretch and yes there are crazy decisions involved, but there have been far worse stretches in horror movies. So this is kind of ""logical"" if you want to call it that. Also the horror/shock moments are build up nicely too.Don't get me wrong though, it's not that it's not predictable or does not have its downfalls, I'm saying that it's still decent considering all those things. Also the ending had a punch (bullet/shock, whatever you want to call it), that is kind of worth watching it through. While not the best of the bunch, you can have some ""fun"" with this ..."
tt3387542,"Aokigahara, otherwise known as Suicide Forest, literally writes its own stories. It's a place where people go to end their lives, a real life horror vista which has haunted many documentaries and videos. As creepy as the setting is, The Forest is still trapped on archaic horror gimmicks. It doesn't mean it has no merit, few of its moments are quite delightful, yet it spends most of the time wandering across predictable set-ups and mundane scares.Sara (Natalie Dormer) goes to Japan to find her missing twin sister Jess (also Natalie Dormer). The search leads her to Aokigahara, the infamous forest. Unfazed by this revelation, Sara is still determined to search for her, almost stubbornly so. Natalie Dormer of Game of Thrones' fame is definitely a draw as this is a different genre than her other works. She does put in the effort, her strong motivation persists although the character is stuck on typical scream queen stereotype.It's insane how many times her character randomly strolls to dark corners or investigates weird occurrence alone even though ample warnings have been given. These are actions common sense would dictate as unwise, especially on a place called Suicide Forest, yet she performs them blindly anyway. It's pretty over saturated that the excuse of her being in trance because hypnotic forest made her do it is not sufficient anymore.There are some good moments that are chilling and well presented, it even occasionally ventures to psychological perspective of the ordeal. However, the movie usually returns to average scares of oriental horror such as vague ominous warning or lost girl in peculiar outfit. It's a rigid showcase of horror, one that's been used since the days of Ju-On and arguably even before that.While the draw of exotic location and appealing lead actress might interest visitors, they would only find basic horror in The Forest."
tt3387542,"The woods can be a very scary place. When I was in college, one of my friends talked me into going for a nighttime walk which led us into an old cemetery filled with trees. When we reached the middle of the cemetery, a tall figure which seemed to have no face stepped out from behind a tree and groaned like a ghost. I had run about half-way back towards the cemetery entrance before I heard people laughing hysterically. The ""ghost"" removed the gray hood from his head and my friends and I had a good laugh about the whole incident as we walked back to the campus. If it turns out there's no real danger, it can be fun to be scared. If you're in an actual haunted forest, not so much. A deep, dark forest with many reasons to fear it is the primary setting for the horror thriller ""The Forest"" (PG-13, 1:35).Jess and Sara Price (both played by Natalie Dormer) are twins, but are identical in looks only. Sara is the responsible one, while Jess is a free spirit who often makes poor choices – and who has a dark side. Not long after Jess takes a job teaching English in Japan, she goes missing. Whether Jess wanted to disappear or whether something bad happened to her, Sara, who believes twins have a spiritual connection, senses that Jess needs her, so Sara flies to Japan.Reportedly, Jess was last seen entering Aokigahara Forest. Covering 14 square miles at the base of Mount Fuji, the forest is dense and foreboding – and not just because of the tall trees and difficult terrain. The locals say that previous generations of poor Japanese brought their sick and elderly residents into the forest and left them to die. According to Japanese folklore, the spirits of people who die suddenly, are murdered or don't have the proper funeral rites performed, remain in the physical realm to haunt the living. That would make this forest a less-than-desirable place to, say have a family picnic. It doesn't help matters that, for decades, Aokigahara Forest has been a popular location for people committing suicide. Still, tourists without a death wish do choose to visit this place. Sara has to.Not knowing the language, the customs or the terrain, and not knowing what to believe about the forest, all make Sara's search pretty challenging. She attempts to retrace her twin sister's steps, but when she gets out to the forest, the people at the visitor's center treat her with a strange combination of politeness, callousness and fear. Sara is determined to go into the forest looking for her sister, but is warned repeatedly ""Do Not Leave the Path"". In her hotel, Sara meets an Australian journalist named Aiden (Taylor Kinney) who offers to get her together with a local guide in exchange for her story.Michi (Yukiyoshi Ozawa) reluctantly agrees to let Sara tag along with him and Aiden as Michi searches for bodies of people who recently committed suicide in the forest. Michi doesn't seem especially superstitious until Sara finds a recently occupied tent that she believes belongs to Jess and decides to spend the night in the forest. Michi tells her that the forest, especially after dark, can make you see things – and even make you do things – ""very bad things"". Sara is undeterred, so Aiden decides to stay with her. In order to avoid spoilers, all I'll say further is that over the ensuing hours, Sara's quest to find her sister gets more complicated and scarier and when Michi returns, he finds an empty tent.""The Forest"" is an original and entertaining horror movie. It's not a slasher flick – more like a creepy and sometimes scary supernatural thriller. Think of it as a combination of ""The Amityville Horror"", ""The Descent"" and ""The Grudge"". I'm not sure what's so scary about Japanese schoolgirls, but this movie makes good use of them, as well as visions of various deceased individuals, who have a more self-evident fright factor. First-time feature film director Jason Zada gives us enough scary images (a few of which might make some Movie Fans jump in their seats) to qualify this as a horror film, but it's effectiveness lies in what you don't see – and don't know about the characters and their surroundings.Every movie of this type has its surprises and twists, but Zada doesn't overdo anything and the reveals he does put forward feel organic. In that sense, the film uses the common pitfalls of the genre in its favor, as we are on the lookout for cheap tricks which aren't there. This film also lays the groundwork for its plot more thoroughly and contains plot points, dialog and acting, that are all better than you find in most horror movies. I did spot a couple minor plot holes that I wish had been fixed up and a couple plot points that I wish had been clearer, but this is still an above average horror thriller that you'll be glad has the guts to stray from its genre's well-worn paths. ""B+"""
tt3387542,"""We're identical twins, if she was dead I would know it."" In Japan there is a forest known and the suicide forest. Sara Price (Dormer) has received a call informing her that her twin sister Jess may have killed herself in that forest. Not believing she is dead Sara travels halfway around the world to find her sister. The farther she travels into the forest searching for her sister the stranger things become. This is one of the better horror movies to come out in a while. The movie is not just slasher and actually has a real plot and the fact that the forest is real gives it that extra push it needed. The movie is psychological and deliberately paced, which adds to the overall horror aspect of the movie. This is not a movie that will make you scream and jump, but it will affect you and make you feel a little uneasy and stay with you for a few days. That is what a horror movie is supposed to do. Overall, one of the better horror movies recently and I did like it. I give this a B+."
tt3387542,"After Sarah discovers her twin sister has disappeared into the suicide forest, she travels to Japan in hopes of finding her, after getting some help from a guy she's met, of which had clearance to take her into said forest, things take a turn for the worse as strange occurrences befall Sarah, as well as the others, turning more, and more sinister, and even deadly. First off, the story of this entire film I personally thought was neat. Having the emotional depth of knowing your close siblings missing was unique, and added impact toward this film. Making things serious, including having said sister missing in another country, let alone the deadliest place in said country is worse, adding tension, as well as some hope for the audience. Moving on; throughout this entire movie, things ended up a bit clichéd-like, in terms of the whole genre of horror. This horror movie took the clichéd route. You know when your sitting there, soaking the film in, and suddenly, for example, someone slams their face randomly against the window of your house, or say car for absolutely no reason, other than the sake to just make you jump. This movie did that a few times, for absolutely no reason, out of nowhere, something just jumps at you for the sake of scaring you. Another element, following through with that. Again, have you ever seen a horror movie to where the film tricks you to think the characters actually going through a trauma, but awakes to find out it's just a nightmare? I personally felt as if this movie overdid that quite a bit, it kept having our main character, Sarah dream of something terrifying, then awake - Once again leading the film to just throw that randomly in there for the sake of scaring us. However.. for the scares in this film to where actually made sense, they successfully succeeded in not only adding tension, but managing to be nerve racking, and completely unsettling. Dark, creepy atmosphere, as well as a tense build-up of suspense succeeded in not only making the audience paranoid, but scaring them in the process of unleashing the awaiting scare. The characters, all around, I felt did a solid job executing their characters, and what they stood for, in terms of their background stories, in-depth traits, etc., as the audience, it felt compelling to know more, and dig deeper toward the characters' personality depth, instead of keeping them vague, and randomly placed just for the sake to be killed off, as they were actually quite intriguing, and well played out.Overall, this movie had flaws. But usually horror movies in January are red flags, showing it's bad. However. This movie was quite surprising, succeeding in some successful jump scares, but more importantly creepy, unsettling atmosphere, and an overall white- knuckled environment. Although this film took a cliché toward the constant, randomly placed jump scares, as well as dream sequences, in my opinion, it still managed to tie in necessary jump scares, so to speak. The characters were intriguing, with great back-story, and development. The film managed to tie in some thought - provoking moments that succeeded, but were answered. The film, however, not mentioned before seemed to have a bit of a mixed - unresolvable way of answering the entire film itself, making the entire thing a bit confusing, but for the most part answering needed answers to have this movie make sense. For a first weekend January horror film, this wasn't bad, but it suffered heavily clichéd plot flaws. Aside that, this was surprising! I honestly had a good time with this film, and would recommend a look toward horror fans / people who want an intriguing, unsettling time!"
tt3387542,"I thought this movie would suck, so me and my friend went to see it (mainly to make fun of anything we could). We ended up making fun of the movie because we were scared. It messed with our brains and made us question what was real and what wasn't in the movie. The movie got a lot of jumps on me, and even a few blood-curtailing screams. The Forest was so much fun to watch and the audience never knew what to expect. I would definitely see it again, and I am most certainly buying the movie the day it comes out on DVD. The movie was not as expected and I adored the heck out of it. Good story, great acting, great job messing with the audience."
tt3387542,"Creepy, but something is missing here.The Forest is about a young woman (Sarah) who goes into Aokigahara, which is also known as the Suicide Forest, to search for her sister, Jess. Both played by Natalie Dormer. The movie looked creepy enough to get me intrigued. After leaving the movie, I couldn't help but feel like it was missing something.. It felt as if it had a sub-plot written, but was cut before filming. A few of the CGI effects were kinda lame, like when little girls faces turn all ghostly, but the movie does have some good scares. There is a good enough story to keep you interested from start to finish, and a pretty decent, twisted ending. The Forest is creepy, well, paced, and has good tension, but felt was missing a chunk of the film."
tt3387542,"'The Forest', was it a horror film ?? Starring Natalie Dormer in dual role as Jess/Sara Price, The Forest is one of the movies in 2016 which everyone would like to leave in the forest itself. The trailer felt better and promising with Dormer in the lead but after watching the movie, I just felt that I wasted 90 minutes of my time waiting for something spooky to happen. The movie was bad as its plot line and there was nothing horror in the movie. A bad start for a horror genre movie in 2016. The best use for this forest would be to dig a hole and bury this pathetic and boring horror film to the surface. The movie deserves 1.5/10"
tt3387542,"I was really looking forward to this. I have enjoyed Natalie Dormer's work in the past and the concept of a movie built around the Suicide Forest is intriguing. But, unfortunately, this wasn't good. It's never scary and rarely even feels like it tries to be. Also, I'm disappointed to say Natalie Dormer does not give one of her better turns here playing two American twins. Her accent is suspect and her performance seems forced. It's sad when a glorified male model (Taylor Kinney) gives a more natural performance than she does but that's exactly what happens here. I'm not saying it's a completely unwatchable movie. I had no problem sitting through it, even it was never particularly engaging. But it's very forgettable and left no lasting impression on me except disappointment. It's not something I can ever see myself watching again."
tt3387542,"'The Forest' is a flawed film. Forests are such a perfect environment for a horror movie to be set in. They lend themselves to so many options and are an uncomfortable setting for a lot of people, especially at night. Now, with a horror film almost entirely set in one (and even titled one) you would be sure you were in for a little bit of a fun ride. Sadly in this case, no. Director Jason Zada tries his best to create a creepy atmosphere but ultimately fails. In part, he fails due to a line early in the film which states, ""everything you see is in your mind"" (or something to that effect). Now this is just simply not a smart line to have at the start of a horror movie. Instantly the audience is completely taken out of the frightened perspective of the character and can safely watch the rest of the film knowing that nothing scary that appears is actually of any significance. Add to that numerous dream sequences early in the film and you've completely lost the interest of every viewer you have.All you're left with after all that is gone are cheap jump scares. A few of them work and give you a sudden jolt but horror has evolved so far past those in the modern age that it certainly doesn't make this a good film. There's a complete lack of tension at any stage and characters are bland and uninteresting, making this an almost entire misfire. A few jumps might be of interest for the most tolerant of horror lovers, otherwise though avoid at all costs."
tt4426464,"It's good to see other compAnies doing animated movies other than Disney, but watching some of these flicks you can see why Disney is on top.
The animation on this was weak. I don't know how much the movie cost, but I would assume that the animation studio may not have had the technology budget to make it flow. It felt very stiff.
The music was very lackluster. You could possibly make up for weak animation with a good score but they did not have enough of one going through the movie
The story had no quality to it, which may not have been that big of a problem if the characters where more interesting. This is a combination of the weak animation and the voice over cast that had some big names who seem to be phoning it in for a paycheck.
I know I'm saying a lot to discourage people from seeing this. In reality it's not a bad picture...of your renting it at home for your kids to see. It has that Disney formula but they need to add more sugar."
tt4426464,"Weird that there were two movies in the same year that dealt with mail service in the Arctic. This was cute, but we liked Klaus better. Is the triumph of Amazon making logistics and delivery cool again?Sienna's Rating: 6 Stars
Sebastian's Rating: 6 Stars
Paul's Rating: 6 Stars."
tt4426464,Overall not the best animation fornthis year. Angry Birds 2 and Abominable were much better.This movie was boring while lacking humor. Pretty dry and bland. There's nothing to take home from as the main theme/message but just senseless boredom. I don't recommend it.
tt4426464,"Me and 3 other friends went to go see this at a dollar theater as a joke knowing it would be bad. But to my dismay it was actually not as bad as i expected it to be. There was actually a few things to appreciate (as minimal as they were). For one the voice acting ranged from decent to really good. I really enjoyed John Cleese's performance as the main antagonist. It's like he knew how ridiculous his role as a mechanical walrus was so he chose to have as much fun with it as he could, and it really does show and it was his performance alone that saved this movie from being completely awful. But unfortunately that's the only real redeeming quality this movie has. The rest is utter garbage. I guess where i'm getting at is i didn't hate this movie in it's entirety surprisingly. It's just so laughably generic. You could make the argument that this movie was intended for children and not four 17 year olds, but even then i think the movie failed at that cause we never heard one chuckle from the audience and a 3rd of the families there walked out of it. At least me and my pals got something out of it."
tt4426464,"Well, nothing I can say since it is Entertainment Studios first animated feature but that the story is very generic and reminds me of a past animated movie I have seen but will not name. The characters are bland like im watching an animated series. It is a fun little movie for kids, that's for sure and I do hope that their future animated films become much more original and better in terms of animation and story."
tt4426464,"I don't see all the hate for this one. Then again, I am a child at heart, and seeing how children are the target audience for this film, I got it on DVD.Telling the tale of Swifty, an arctic fox who works at the mailroom of the Arctic Blast Delivery Service, who dreams of being a Top Dog, one of the company's husky couriers. After his boss tells him he is a fox, not a dog, he decides to prove himself when his best friend, Jade Fox, has a package that needs delivered. However, the receiver is Otto Von Walrus, who is plotting to melt the Arctic. Now he must get his friends together to stop them.Basically, this film is obviously aimed at kids or those who are kids at heart, because the film teaches two morals: follow your dreams, no matter what anyone says, and always be yourself. The characters are likable, and have a lot of development, and the music is also good."
tt4426464,"Artic Dogs (2019) is a movie I saw in theatres with my daughter. The storyline follows an artic fox who works in a mailroom but feels he is bound for bigger aspirations. One day luck would have it that he gets his wish and he quickly discovers grander things may be more than he bargained for... This movie is directed by Aaron Woodley (Spark: A Space Tail) and includes voices from Jeremy Renner (Avengers), James Franco (Your Highness), Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dog), John Cleese (A Fish Called Wanda), Heidi Klum (Zoolander) and Alec Baldwin (The Departed). The storyline for this was entertaining primarily due to the unique settings and characters. The villain was just okay and takes a little while to set-up; but once he does, is worthwhile. The animation is excellent as you'd expect. This isn't a classic or must add to your movie collection, but it is a fun watch family movie and doesn't deserve the harsh reviews it is receiving. I would score this a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once."
tt4426464,The characters are unlikable and bland. The animation looks cheap and the story is clichéd. I do not recommend this movie.
tt4426464,My kid loved it which is what matters. It starts off pretty slow but it is overall a decent movie for kids. Maybe not great for adults as well but whatever.
tt4426464,Okay so i watched this as a double feature with the terminator over the weekend and this was a movie for sure kids who like dogs and snow will enjoy but its just not something they would like otherwise the movie isnt very funny or sweet or anything good yeah there are a few laughs but not enough to be cosidered as worth the price but if your kids like dogs it will be worth every penny if not wait for frozen 2 to come out
tt4426464,"A lot of people have described the film as ""generic"", which I don't disagree with, but at the same time, I think ""underwhelming"" is a good term. So much aspects of the film, ranging from the plot, the characters, the setup, and so on - just feel so uneventful. I imagine they had difficulty making this into a full-length film, because there's nothing remarkable to really say about so much aspects.The voicing cast is pretty good, I'll admit, so that's at least one plus I can think of, and if I had to think of another, I guess the character designs aren't too bad either, but other than that, there's not much special aspects of the film.It's not a horrendous film, don't get me wrong, I mean, it's not ""Foodfight!"" level of bad, however, it's also fairly below average too. I think it would've been to have the film as a TV special or anything similar, because it really struggles to present itself as a film.Granted, I know the film probably isn't intended for 18-year olds like me, however, the film has so much wrong with it that I don't think a lot of children would feel particularly interested, because the film just feels like something that's already been done before, and in much better ways too."
tt4426464,"The trailers for this movie looked promising, so we took our 4 1/2 year old grandson to see it. I have to say, while he laughed and enjoyed it - I was very disappointed. They depicted puffins blasting other animals off of the face of the earth and the ""intelligence"" bureau had a punch in the face as their secret handshake - really = not behaviors I want my grandson to model. The movie was attempting to teach a lesson ab0ut global warming, but failed - and a lesson about being tru to yourself, which only an adult could figure out, and about team work - I think next time I will put the $$$ in a college savings program and stay home and read a book with him."
tt4426464,"Arctic Dogs is a terrible animated film with subpar animation that is bright and colorful. The voice cast is Really good with great actors such as Jeremy Renner and John Cleese, but it cannot save this unfunny and completely disposable mess of a film.It's an incredibly lazy film with nothing inventive in its animation or storytelling with very little in terms of character development and a villain who's motivations are unclear throughout the majority of the film. It's not good and it's very lazy, much like this review."
tt4426464,"Poor voicing of characters which usually happens when famous actors/personalities are used instead of using professional voice actors.
Animal characters are too human like. They don't have their unique animal personalities.
Animation quality is poor to fair - static, 2-D, plain flat.
Storyline is non-creative of good vs. evil animals. Evil animal probably not for the younger viewers.
Poor background music."
tt4426464,"Sure it may not be the greatest of animated films, but it didn't deserve any hate, low scores or tanking at the box-office.Compare to most ego-egocentric protagonist, Swift is actually likable and relatable and you can root for him though out the film. John Cleese's villains is much better than the one he played in that overrated mess, Igor. As this villains is not only likable but he's also kind of funny. His dialog is hilarious as well as his touching backstory. The soundtrack in the film is also excellent and the fact the swifty sings in it is a nice touch.Better than Inspector Gadget 1999, Shark Tale and Free Birds but not as good as Wonder Park, Uglydolls and Addams Family 2019."
tt4426464,"Watched it with my 5 year old. A little intense for him in some parts, story makes no sense, but my kid enjoyed."
tt4426464,"Wasn't expecting much from this given some of the negative reviews. However I enjoyed it. Was pleasantly surprised. Loved all the characters, and enjoyed the story. Give it a go for yourself. You might enjoy it too"
tt4426464,"Arctic Dogs follows a good story, with simple and child-friendly news, classic plot elements and amiable animal characters that are fun. The polar team is well positioned and with humor and classic joy in tinkering around and experiencing adventure. The warm-hearted polar bear, the funny slapstick Alabatros, the creative beavers, the squeaky mice and of course the two foxes with good hearts have become really very good figures. The classic villain is also funny and well thought out. The puffins are a good comic relief. The whole story is surprisingly tight and fun from start to finish. A masterpiece has not succeeded here because the really big story idea was simply missing. In addition, the animations are not the best, but they are very easy to see. The city looks good and so do the animals. The action at the end was maybe a tad too much, but it was still within limits. All in all a good film that would certainly have been even better drawn. The numerous bad reviews are shockingly weak. First of all, this is not a film about Amazon shipping, but about the post office. Amazon is a mail order company (which incidentally exploits its workers), while the post office is a service to the community. The fact that many people apparently cannot stand a film that is not overflowing with over-the-top humor, but does not forget values, target groups and classic storytelling, is a sign of our time - and not a good one. This film is definitely a great family home evening."
tt4426464,"Well, this movie is worse than I imagined. It's super generic, there's nothing new! It's the same jokes, the same plots, the same morals, everything like other generic movies. The only thing that changes is that it's set in Antarctica and the characters are furry. I only give 3 stars because the animation is cute. Apart from that, the movie is, in fact, horrible, generic and tedious."
tt4426464,"Basically the same thing as Deep (2017); boring, atrocious and dumb jokes. I think that the story is weak, as there isn't really any potential for the movie. They fill it with potty humour and fart jokes. I can't say anything else because it's just so weak and boring."
tt4426464,"What's up with super famous celebrities being in really garbage movies no one has heard of or will watch? For example Jim rash in a stupid elf movie, John cena in this stupid firefighter movie."
tt4426464,"Yep this movie suck the got damn right worst of them all and you wanna know why because it loks cheap everytime there is a bug in the system all the charaters start to glitch out and malfunction like robots plus the voice actors,plus ms.houston,John clease and jemmery Renner from the avengers really did not put hard work into this i mean did they even do the plot better and the moral of the story is "" follow your dreams "" that is complete bullsh#t and not important to thd story. And thats why this waste of time movie is the worst of them all."
tt6269658,Pretty boring for the concept. And I really didn't like the animation style
tt6269658,"It certainly only caters for its target audience, though 'Monster Island' has its moments and I'm sure the young generation will like it.The animation is the weakest part to this though, which isn't a good sign in this genre. It's very low budget, on the same level as the type you'd see in old video games. Some of the static bits are alright, but all the live stuff (weather, effects etc.) look pretty terrible. The most interesting character is Johnny Rose's Norcutt, despite his under-developed motives.Away from that though, it's an OK film. The voice cast are acceptable, while the humour is probably pretty spot on for those it's aimed for. I will say though, there is one scene which actually did make me chuckle; it involves Jessie J's 'Bang Bang' song playing over it.All in all a fairly poor film, mainly down to the questionable animation, but I reckon the intended age bracket will somewhat enjoy."
tt6269658,"Not much I can say except I don't see why people keep saying its a great movie, the plots boring, the voice acting's pretty bad, and the designs of the characters are confusing and nauseous. I will give it one up side and say that the animating is alright but other than that this movie has a lot that is just not going for it. The buildings in the city are too cartoony for a movie with this style, there main character is somewhat dull. Now all that being said the movie's idea is good, its a near classic but the way it was shown was not done well. And one more thing, the main character seems to be too heavily protected by plot, he seems to have a solution to each problem and doesn't seem to have a struggle."
tt6269658,"It's traditional in most movies to have what's called a colour palette, a finite range of colours which sets a mood and makes it easier on the eye, this movie eschews this tradition. Its standard of computer graphics reminds me of old Playstation FMV scenes that played out inbetween the game play, except with ALL THE COLOURS!!The animation itself isn't that bad, but it has that unsubtle mime-like kind of motion where everyone ducks, shrugs and gesticulates on every syllable whilst the camera floats from point to point in every scene. The voice acting often has that sound like someONE reading from a SCRIPT with no IDEA about the conTEXT or CHARacter, but they can do a funny voice or three so just read it with FEELING!The story itself is a reasonably well paced paint-by-numbers tale of going on a journey of self discovery, a 'child becomes a man' fantasy adventure, with the monster angle being used as an unsubtle analogy for adolescence, and by the end the currently obligatory single parent learns their lesson and promises to do better, everybody hugs, hearts are warmed with an upbeat pop song and a wink to camera, credits roll.It's a rainbow coloured cliche, but that won't put off those still young enough to enjoy it."
tt6269658,"When young Lucas discovers he's not really a human; the news changes your whole world. At a school dance, Lucas discovers he comes from a long line of monsters. Eager to find the rest of his family, he sets out for the island of Calvera. Especially since her first monster transformation happened in front of the most popular kids at school!So cute, these animations with parents and children (especially big daddy) cute, and bullying portrayed in such a common and sad way... And then the world of little monsters, what a cute thing, delicious to taste with the little ones, very cute and with that moral message to discuss with children... S2."
tt6269658,This film actually surprised me with how good it was and made me laugh which was a great thing. I liked that it showed the bad guy throughout the movie and his plans as well as showing the boys and how he goes from a normal boy to a monster and then saving the day. Great family film and one I will definitely watch again.
tt6269658,Sometimes a teenager feels like a monster and this is an entertaining movie that tells you about her and a secret fantasy world.The animation seems a little rustic but it is a style of its own.I caught the idea of trying to connect and assume its origin as a monster and find in its roots its own identity.The story seems simple but I think it is ideal for boys if they want to entertain with the problems of puberty in an exaggerated way.
tt6269658,"When I started watching this movie I had no idea what to expect, by the title I thought it was just going to be another monster movie... but I was wrong. The story is really captivating and I bet a lot of teenagers may easily identify with the main characters. A lot of metaphors have been used in the story to talk about being different and how to accept yourself the way you are. I found it very honest in the portrait of each single character who is presented as they are with both their virtues and vices. This is definitely a film which you can enjoy with the entire family because, apart from making you laugh, it will teach you a lesson or two about the consequences of feeling excluded by the rest of society. Great job!"
tt6269658,"Good animation, likeable characters and it kept my 3yr old quiet for an hour and a half."
tt6269658,"Monster Island is a great film because of its animation and unique story line. I love how the monsters are animated. I also adore the story line. It's something I've never seen before. Monster Island is about a boy named Lucas who's a monster, but doesn't know it since his dad hid it from him his whole life. His dad has given him a potion to stop him from turning into a monster by hiding it as an inhaler. When Lucas forgets his inhaler at home to go the biggest party of the year, he turns into a monster which scares everyone. Luckily, his dad comes to the rescue with his inhaler which turns him back into a human. His dad explains what's happening and where he got his powers from. Turns out, they're from an island called Calvera. Lucas goes on an adventure to find this island. But will he find it? Watch it to find out!The animation reminds me of Frankenweenie and Coraline which are some of my favorite Halloween movies. Unlike Frankenweenie and Coraline, Monster Island is all computer animation. However, it looks like claymation. I'm fascinated by the attention to detail. Every monster is unique. There are squid monsters and humongous monsters who tower over people. I love the characters in this movie. Two of my favorites are the two police officers. I love their banter as they try to catch Lucas, but always fail. I love how the pumpkin monster is the ""brains"" of their team while the deer head monster is the tough dumb one. They had me cracking up the whole time. The message of this movie is to accept yourself. Lucas' uncle tries to become a monster since he never became a monster. He felt left out because all of his family are monsters, but he isn't. Although his family loves him either way, he still tries to find a way to become a monster through science. I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to ages 6 to 10. You can find this incredible movie online now so, go check it out. Available on YouTube, Google Play, Budi and more.

tt5740806,"Anyone who sees Coin Heist needs to have clear expectations as to what this film is and isn't. They should know going in to not expect the greatest heist movie you've ever seen or expect the production value to match some of Netflix's finest originals. Then again, it's definitely not the worst - it meets at an in-between mediocre groove that neither provides the audience with anything worth seeing and also doesn't ""hurt"" the viewer.Right off the bat, the film's biggest flaw is its weak script and honestly cringe-worthy dialogue (more in the first half of the movie). The premise itself isn't inherently terrible but a few minutes into the movie, the audience will be able to tell it was written very poorly. Very, very poorly. Since this is such a big flaw, the movie itself suffers as a whole and doesn't make a great time.That being said, there are some saving graces that make it easy to watch. First, the performances in general weren't bad. Particularly a few of the leads were actually good and the cast's effort in trying to sell the plot actually turned out believable in many cases. It's just a shame some decently talented actors are in a blander film then they should be. Second, it's shot consistency well throughout the picture. The cinematography and ""look"" to the film includes vibrant and visually compelling shots that make it even easier to watch. The editing also reflects a straightforward, precise feel that helps the film move at a very comfortable place that leaves no room for boredom. If anyone is looking for an easy to watch, substance free flick to play at a party for some background entertainment, this will do just fine. If they're looking for a more well written movie to have a better time with and enjoy more thoroughly, this is far from it. Despite its strengths, the terrible writing does indeed place this movie in the ""negatives"" but definitely isn't the worst you'll find. All in all, it would be best to pass on this one since there are just so many better Netflix originals out there."
tt5740806,Has some elements of that classic 80's teen movie however has a ton of flaws. The teacher character is unlikable and it's amazing how these 16 year olds can pass as professional adults on multiple occasions. Movie will require a little suspension of belief to enjoy.
tt5740806,"Bad story, bad acting, lasted 10times longer than It should have. Give me back the time I wasted watching this hoping for a clever twist worthy of a heist movie."
tt5740806,"A Netflix production that fails to impress on literally every aspect of filmmaking. It's script is at times cheesy, doesn't make sense (why discuss a teenage crush in the middle of a robbery?) and the entire middle segment of the story is boring as hell. The directing isn't much better either. Some awkward shots and blocking in there. And the acting ranges from poor to mediocre. We watched this one with the family (40,38,13,11 years old). Not one of us enjoyed it."
tt5740806,"If you can appreciate a decent heist story pulled of by decent teenage characters, without Hollywood production values, then you should really give this a try.Emily Hagins wrote and directed and I think she did a fine job with the adaptation from a novel. The narrative had a strong even pace and it never dragged. The young actors gave it their all, and I think they pulled it off just fine.Don't be too critical of these small indie efforts, and you'll find a gem or two. ""Coin Heist"" may not have the huge budget that the ""Oceans"" series had, but the story was just as interesting and just as well told.Enjoy it."
tt5740806,"""Coin Heist"" has so much potential given the premise. Four students endeavor to save their school financially by breaking into a US government mint and producing ""error"" coins that can be sold for millions. As it turns out, the father of one of these students embezzled $10M from the school's endowment fund, necessitating the operation.Given the interesting and promising premise, this film could have been so much better. Instead, it is bogged down with horrible and banal dialogue that takes the audience nowhere. Also, there are scenes that are downright silly--the US government mint's only security seems to be two inept guards at the front desk and nothing else. Four teens can wander around the mint in this post 9/11 world without being questioned or even noticed. There doesn't even appear to be any cameras in place. How convenient, if you're a teen wanting to rob the place. There are also overly done stereotypes, the black kid from the wrong side of the tracks who is harassed by the rich white kid and the angst-ridden computer nerd. Overall, the cast does a pretty good job with the material they are given; they are believable in their roles. Unfortunately, they are mired in a movie that just doesn't work."
tt5740806,"The film itself is not that bad to have such a low rating. I mean, yeah, it's not a masterpiece and we can guess the ending from the very beginning, but do you really expect it to be something extraonrdinary? 
The original idea was great, although the plot has faults, it's naive and unreal, sure, but it's still an enjoyable movie. Also the characters didn't have the developpement they needed. Like they show the premise for it but then the ending doesn't show any consequences. In my opinion it was a bit too short and rushed. 
All in all, if you want a real deep suspence drama then I don't recommend it. But if you just want to see an OK film without much moral, drama and serousness, then it may suit very well."
tt5740806,"Female writer/director, Emily Hagins, is very apparently still young, and that comes across in the film.However, contrary to previous productions of young film makers that have gone before, the young perspectives of Emily Hagins, combined with the very capable and professional approach of herself and her crew are both freshening and unique in the movie world. I give this movie a solid 8 out of 10 because the virtually unique combination of youth and professionalism will rarely if ever make it to the big screen.The plot is interesting enough but, and without giving too much away, I have to say failing slightly on the believe-ability scale in terms of how the main characters where able to exploit certain security flaws at the plant.All said, Coin Heist is well worth a watch for any movie buff."
tt5740806,"The moment I see the words ""Netflix Original"" in the title of a movie, I am immediately interested. This movie misses the mark in almost every category. Surprising because Netlox Original movies and shows have been some of the best programs I have ever seen. This movie is horrible. I thought it to be such a clever idea, a heist movie for younger viewers, but I can't imagine any young viewer getting past the first couple minutes, there is absolutely nothing in this movie that will interest anyone of any age. It's a shame because I thought it to be such a fresh, New idea. So many important aspects of the movie are left out, probably due to it being low budget, but it expects you to take too many things for granted. The actors are not believable, the scenes are not believable. The movie only gives you several minutes of the heist. I am so surprised that Netflix allowed this movie to make it through. Too bad."
tt5740806,"Not worth fellows...
It spoiled my afternoon.
Not much thrill and suspense.
Expected better stuff from NETFLIX"
tt5740806,"The premise is wonderful, the actuality of the script is bonkers. Unlike another reviewer here I do not find Netflix Originals groundbreaking in totality They are some of the worst put together movies I have ever seen. They are even starting to produce Lifetime-like movies only using b-c list actors instead of f-g list ones. This movie is watchable however... not mad at it. Just absurd in the sense that none of this could really happen."
tt5740806,If you enjoy watching movies that have have rushed endings that don't tie up essential plot lines - this is the movie for you!
tt5740806,"United by dire circumstances, four unlikely allies from a Philadelphia prep school - the hacker, the slacker, the athlete, and the perfect student - band together to attempt the impossible: steal from the U.S. Mint.I was drawn to this film because the director is somewhat of a celebrated figure. Everyone, myself included, is waiting to see if this apparently child prodigy makes a big name for herself in the world of film. So far she has done alright, but has not landed that one big hit quite yet.This film goes through the motions, but ultimately could have been something made for ABC Family. I wish the ""heist"" part of the film had more punch. The danger is never really played up, and the consequences never seem all that dire, even though this must be an awfully illegal thing to even plan, let alone follow through on."
tt5740806,"Decided to watch this with the family, and in turn I got nothing but a wasted night. Took time out of my busy day to sit down, get popcorn to watch a movie that failed in every aspect. Thanks for a ruined night, Coin Heist. I don't appreciate it.The actors themselves were horrible, as well as the writing, which was more than terrible. Next time I'll watch a movie worth 1 hour and 39 minutes of my time - this one, although, was not!"
tt5740806,The story was so overly simple and not exciting in the least. The acting was on par with what you'd expect with this kind of movie. It was just a hard watch.
tt5740806,"I get what the reviews are saying about the actors being terrible and it's a waste of time but don't let that dictate your decision. It's no Oscar winning Steven Spielberg 5 stars film but the characters are real and some moments actually leave you on the edge of your seat. Please, before you judge this film: GIVE IT A TRY! you might actually enjoy it. :)"
tt5740806,"There are enough things inherent in ""Coin Heist"" that it really shouldn't work. The plot is outlandish, the ending descends into schmaltz, and (at heart) it's a teen coming-of-age drama (not like there are any of those floating around these days). However, despite all the unevenness and clichés, ""Coin Heist"" still manages to at least be entertaining due to the great acting and slickness of the setup.For a basic plot summary (no spoilers), ""Coin Heist"" sees Jason (Alex Saxon) struggling with the reality that his father has been stealing from his high school's endowment, leaving the father in prison and the school in danger of shutting down. After a field trip to the U.S. mint, however, Jason's friend Alice (Alexis G. Zall), a hacker at heart and in skill, devises a plan to infiltrate the mint and print some rare coins that can be sold to save the school. The plan will only work, however, if they can also rope in organization queen Dakota (Sasha Pieterse) and outsider Benny (Jay Walker).For the first half or so of ""Coin Heist"", I was invested in the characters and their mission. The producers do a great job of setting up the backgrounds of each character, and I really felt like they could be real high-schoolers. Sure, their mission is highly improbable, but that's what cinema is all about, right?!The problem, however, is that after that roughly half-way point my investment really started to wane for two reasons:1. The build-up to the caper was much more interesting than the caper itself; and 2. I felt that the ending descending into a bit too much hijinx and corniness for my liking. I realize this is a film directed at teens, so perhaps it plays a bit better to that demographic, but for an older viewer it seemed like a bit of a letdown to build up these great characters and then have them, in most cases, succumb to the tropes of the genre I was afraid would happen from the get-go.So, while I can easily give ""Coin Heist"" a slightly-better-than-average 6 out of 10 stars here, I feel that it failed to take that ""next step"" into the greatness range due to its ""running out of steam"" in the latter portion. The target audience (teens) may disagree with me here, of course."
tt5740806,"The movie is great. The soundtracks are great. The trailer is great. The casts are great. But the characters killed the casts in less than 2 hours. They should have made it right without the slow dialogues and the less-initiative characters. It's like the audiences are missing the good parts while the story continues. This should have been thrilling, fun, and endeavour-type of movie, but the school contains of the ""same"" people who look useless in the background. No full ambience creates a certain emotion in every scene. Even with the teachers itself. All look the same. All show the same expressions. Like we have to process everything while they are interacting with one another. It's about time for movie like ""this"" to bring out the good differences. No stereotypes needed, just toss the diversity in. Did Hollywood ever learn from the past? There musts be a reason why they created the movie and I hope they learn thoroughly from it, especially a novel adaptation. It could be a disaster or a savior, one way or another. And this movie should have been a savior."
tt5740806,"It makes some emotion on my heart but I wait a breaking point in the film. It is a cute movie. If there is a unexpected scenes, may receive much more ratings. Playings and artists quite enough. Anyway, I enjoy while watching it. Sasha is very beautiful and Alex is very handsome. Maybe the film finished with they are together."
tt5792472,"I'm writing this review in the week that Netflix's stock surged by 10% as they beat market predictions, moving away from their 'rent-a- DVD' model to concentrate on original, quality content. Normally, this one would have slipped under my radar, but I saw it was picked up by distribution by Netflix and thought: let's give it a go.I would describe this movie as being a sort of cross between Clerks and Superbad. It's a day in the life of two low-achieving shelf stackers at a Wholesome Foods (definitely not 'Whole Foods') store somewhere in the urban sprawl of LA. Their goal is to obtain tickets for a sold out concert, and they are not short on schemes to do so: be it ripping off a drug dealer, stealing cash from their boss, counter-ripping off a ticket forging older brother, and so on.This movie's great strength - its random, weird, unpredictable nature - is also its greatest weakness. When watching any one scene, you have no idea what is going to happen. However, it also means the film struggles to find a consistent tone. Some characters (mostly the freeloading Chris) are very wacky and cartoonish. Others, like the conflicted Chester are more maudlin, and it doesn't work very well together. The movie's best and most consistent performance is without doubt the psychotic drug dealer Jay, played by Chester Tam, who was also the movie's writer and director. Every time he's on screen, he's like a force of nature. I was strangely reminded of Joe Pesci in Goodfellas, if he was a 6'5"" tattooed Korean.Oddly, the moments that worked the best were the more dramatic ones. The comedy sort of fell flat in a lot of places, probably due to the aforementioned problem of the film not really having a clear idea of how many feet it wanted to keep in reality. A scene where two guys dodge incoming bullets driving down the freeway in a battered Corvette does not play well with a scene where the same two guys have a serious and frank discussion about where their friendship and lives are going.In summary, Take The 10 will probably play well for the late-night comedy (read: 'stoner') crowd, but never guns any higher than that. Bonus points for a cameo role from Andy Samberg ('The Lonely Island') who proves he can make just about anything funny."
tt5792472,"'Take the 10' attempts more than your average low quality comedy does, but a lot of the humour falls flat.It is certainly a comedy first and foremost, though sadly it has too much forced sex humour - the casting is also a bit of a mismatch. Josh Peck (Chris) and Tony Revolori (Chester) aren't anything atrocious at all, there's just a lack of sizeable chemistry which I think is needed for their roles. The rest of the cast aren't really that standout-ish, they are all rather plain - with the exception of director Chester Tam's Jay, who is alright.I do respect the plot to this. It gets contrived quickly and isn't majorly interesting, but at least they tried to add a meaningful premise to the comedy as opposed to solely relying on the comedy itself like most do.Not something I'd recommend all that highly, though there's certainly worse films from this genre out there."
tt5792472,The story is fine but the acting is subpar and the humour is not existent. I think I chuckled once or twice in the whole thing. It felt like a chore to finish it.
tt5792472,"Awful train wreck of a watch, will not watch again, and can't recommend.The writing in this is awful: the structure and the character work are horrible, and the plot(s) is barely passable, but the execution could be a significant factor.Josh Peck has clearly lucked out networking since his child acting career to even be in this piece of garbage, and Tony Revolori is so wildly unlikable I even hate him being in Spiderman as Flash, the guy you're supposed to hate: I don't even like him for not liking him. Chester Tam is completely replaceable: he doesn't do a bad job, it just is an empty role.Kevin Corrigan is the only male actor worth mentioning in a positive light. He has the bare minimum of good acting in this and reminded me that movie COULD have gotten better at some point.The ladies are the best parts of this movie. Stella Maeva (""The Magicians"") and Cleopatra Coleman (""Last Man on Earth"") have the best characters: empowered even without authoritative roles, and they're so underwritten that they basically get paid for looking beautiful and doing a days worth of decent acting.I really wish I had anything else positive to say about the movie, but when the best thing you can say about a movie is, ""I like x"" or ""x is gorgeous"", it's a high sign that the movie isn't worth the time."
tt5792472,My husband and I had insomnia and nothing worked until we watched this boring movie. Must watch if you're having difficulty sleeping.
tt5792472,"The film is in no way a masterpiece, but for the short run time(1hr,20mins)it is worth as watch. It has some great moments and features Andy Samburg in a small supporting role.The film is worth a look,on a boring day.There is not much else I can say about it,overall a 6.5 or 7 out of 10."
tt5792472,If you have an intelligence level higher than a slug don't watch this.
tt5792472,"It was free on Netflix so I watched it, needing a comedy.Characters amusing for their foolishness and mutual unreliability. It recalls Houston's ""Beat the Devil"" with Bogart. Everyone has a serious problem. You might say their problems get resolved, not solved.I admire actors who can create work for themselves and that is what has happened here. Produced, written and directed by one of the leads.Don't believe the reviewer who said this was gay propaganda. There's about 20 seconds of superficial gay angle, purely as a joke."
tt5792472,"This film was so badly written and directed that I seriously can't believe someone backed this financially nor that Netflix made this one of their original films. In short... it sucks in every way imaginable and isn't the least bit entertaining! The story line makes no sense whatsoever and is a bad investment of your time to even watch. THIS FILM WAS ANYTHING BUT FUNNY not possessing a funny line anywhere in its cliché and pathetic script, or ridiculous antics. Boring would be a compliment to describing this sorry piece of work. Its just so bad it seems to be career assassination for Josh Peck (actor from Drake and Josh) who was one of the two stars in this film, and yet isn't even listed as a star in the credits (not that it helps him in any way). It was such a bad film that I made it a must do task to get online and write this review to warn the next person, which is something I never do.Save yourself the time and money, and simply find yourself something else to watch. Eventually you'll thank me for it later."
tt5792472,"I actually reactivated my account to post this review. While this movie is by no means a thinker's movie, I found it to be a very fun watch! Don't listen to these other reviews and give it a try - you won't be sorry. For people who can enjoy movies like the Hangover at the right times, give this one a go. I stumbled onto this movie on Netflix right when it was put up, and got hooked watching it. The narrative is similar to Crash in that its a story that is told in pieces, only to be slowly pieced together as the movie goes on. However, the plot is similar to Harold and Kumar. Lots of funny characters, with actors that put on a genuinely enjoyable performance. Enjoy the surprises!Definitely would recommend!"
tt5792472,"If you're looking for a goofy movie to put you in a silly mood, this is the one for you. I was shocked to see the low ratings this film got after watching it and felt it deserved a better one. So here it is! The 2 leads are hilarious and deliver great performances. The chemistry between Tony Revolori and Josh Peck works and felt genuine. The situations the pair get into are insane and hilarious, and the way the narrative plays out in quite interesting since they go with the non linear approach.Again check it out for yourself if you got Netflix!"
tt5792472,"This movie is garbage. Another review said something about how this will probably play well with the Stoner crowd. Just wanted to say: heck no, this certainly doesn't represent me or any stoner I know. Hollywood is such a shame these days. Tons of good actors and actresses, great work on visuals and scenery, but apparently not a single producer left wants to hire anything but the oldest tired hacks, or total space cases. Awful and out of touch. How do they spend so much producing these movies without bothering to hire decent story writers? Who watches these things? I don't get it. This is right up there with every other tired movie out there right now in terms of horrible."
tt5792472,"Terrible plot, terrible acting, overall the whole movie sucked. If you have an IQ higher than 2 don't watch this. Please."
tt5792472,"I normally don't review movies, but I just had to take a few minutes to warn everyone not to go near this trash. I only started watching it solely because I'm a fan of Josh Peck and grew up watching Drake and Josh on Nick. This is not even a movie. There is literally NO PLOT! It looks like it is just a cameraman chasing around random people committing crimes and drug deals. They label it as a ""comedy"" but I didn't even get close to laughing once. The language is very vulgar and inappropriate, containing hundreds of pointless F bombs and frequently references pornography. Not to mention the first 10 minutes of the movie or so ends up repeating itself later on (they literally show the same footage twice). I'm pretty sure you'd have to be high while watching this to even get remotely close to enjoying it. Don't even bother as this crap was 80 minutes of my life I'll never get back."
tt5792472,"The trailer didn't look half bad and since I'm a Drake & Josh fan and enjoyed Revolori's performance in The Long Dumb Road, I figured why not give this a go. The storyline made no sense and the stereotyping wasn't humorous. I only lasted 20 minutes before shutting it off."
tt5792472,"Well it definitely had me hooked, despite what everybody says on the negative reviews it deserves a lot higher then that, Very much a rollercoaster of a movie I like it. it's the kind of movie you can put on and chill out too without too much concentration or consideration, very much an indoor popcorn movie,"
tt5792472,"This film tells the story of two employee in a organic food store, who are broke but have dreams beyond their means. They steal money from three shop and even from a drug dealer. Hence, they get into huge trouble.""Take the 10"" seems promising from the trailer, but the initial thirty minutes or so falls a little flat. Mainly it is because the jokes are to juvenile and stupid, such as the Asian woman Patty making contorted faces while saying something really silly. Fortunately, the second half of the film is better, as it is more funny in a grown up way. Overall, it is alright to kill time, but don't have high hopes on it."
tt5792472,Really not a bad movie and the actors really deliver believable characters.
tt5792472,"In both movies:
1. Main characters are coworkers in a California based grocery store
2. Trying to get to a rave/concert
3. Steal the drug dealers stash
4. Sell drugs at concert to pay off debts
5. Jump storylines from character to character to show all sides of same course of events while revealing a bit more information with each character, to eventually reveal the full plotGo actually is a good movie with characters you care about and their struggles are believable. This movie is not believable and the character development is severely lacking."
tt5792472,"After seeing this film the trending tab of Netflix I decided I would check it out on IMDb, at first I saw many negative reviews (ranging from about 0/10 to 1/10).I couldn't be bothered to find something else so I watched it. Definitely exceeded expectations and above.If you watch the first 58 seconds and don't laugh this movie is not for you as this defying moment of the film as it sums up the entire movie. Definitely give the first minute a try.PLEASE DO NOT LISTEN TO OTHER REVIEWS! (people don't know how to enjoy a fun, just weird film like this)"
tt5792472,This movie is really just a collection of random things happening over the course of 80 mins. It's not terrible but it is by no means worth your time.
tt5792472,"I like that this movie is honest. I identify and relate to it. I feel also, it's a nice thing to have this up and viewable, I don't tend to see films honestly representative of population and life as it is for some folks. And so, ya it is super hella nice to just be refreshed with an honest movie with writing that someone wanted to write, and less crap about editing an art piece to some idea of pretense as though it ought be anything non-what it is.I Love it, appreciated it, and enjoyed the experience watching it.Mwah, also actors, I think y'all did an honest well done job in the project. I imagine also, ya had helpful direction ;) Liked the writing, which I also audibly said aloud while watching the movie. Just plain moved to utter. I think I like that it seems like someone's honest flow of writing, like looking into someone's cosmos or how they see, which is more why I am captivated by writing, if it is just honest to the experiencer of how they experience and create.Viva liberation en media! xoI created an account to contribute a review for this film. Not that I want to believe anyone ought to be swayed to think my think, yet that I want to share my think at this.So, I says, ""Hey, I likey a lot!""Humanizing to the characters each as real humans each their own within a group cast. So, I appreciate that scope and lens the film takes. Humanization for the win! Often, I think films like to create bit characters and objectify their existences into props for satisfying some story line of one person's experience. Yet, life is actually more dynamic, etc. Each human an own Universe, which is pretty amazing to think about it. And I think this kind of lens and take on film is more humanizing, and can help that kind of conditioning or option of viewing humanity. More diffuse, as it is, comes, leaves, goes ... marvel-worthy at all that any of it even is existingLater y'all*****I chose editing some natural flow of words including redeeming expletives, in order to meet IMDb's regulations on posts. I was a bit frustrated because being honest in one's own expression as it is is thematic to the sentiment of the post and I wished I could have done that as it was that moment. Wah wah. As it is, I chose to take a chip in order to leave a review and a reach out to the project. Whooop!"
tt5792472,"Non-linear recount of how the lives of apparently aimless people collided viscously on one hot California day.The use of non-diegetic time is justified given the back tracking to follow a new character though I'm not sure what they thought they were doing by 7:13 visibly changing to 7:14. It's fine I guess. What doesn't really work is the ""last-time-on"" style montages that skate over the things we have already seen and it is very inelegant.That might be my worst criticism of this bombastic ride of unfortunate meet ups, misunderstandings and a lot at stake.It's so good to see Josh Peck now playing unscrupulous slacker that didn't make me think of Josh Nichols (you know, Drake's brother) once.He is juxtaposed to his reluctant best friend who thinks he's going somewhere and that somewhere is Brazil for reasons that are never disclosed. He does not even speak the language.There is a surprise triteragonist though in the form of the boys' boss; an apparently straightlaced man that goes further and further down into insanity, partly for the acting, is a nauseating treat to watch.Slick and dynamic cinematically, at one point they do split screens in the food store, I suppose to evoke the advertisements used for it.I wonder if the bawdy, often pointless dialogue exchanges between highly tightly wound people is a nod to Pulp Fiction but this is so much more engagingly written than anything he has ever done.Overall an unflinching but still somewhat life affirming tale but I am ticked off that the cops never got what's coming to them."
tt3256226,"Although the concept is highly unrealistic, as climate change doesn't make the air poison (don't worry its just turning the ocean into acid), the concept is seemingly original and interesting. I saw the trailer and was intrigued enough to watch. I realized halfway through that this was going to be a pull-out-your-phone kind of movie. There are long stretches where you can look away for thirty minutes and not miss a single thing. There is little suspense in the story and the characters don't act like the movie established they should. There are action scenes that somehow put me to sleep. The costumes, scenery, and visuals are interesting to look at, but nothing to write home about. There are some comical moments where you can see an immaculate lawn or green vegetation in an area that it is established would be impossible.The actors are decent, but don't have much to work with. It feels like the director was yelling, ""more monotone, less passion!"" The script is plodding and full of unnecessary mythology references that will go over most peoples heads and even having knowledge of the stories they were referencing I don't know how it applies. Either it is very complicated or so simple that I am overthinking it. I don't like to throw around the word 'pretentious' a lot, but this is certainly that at times. It is hard to explain without spoilers, but by around 2/3rds in people will understand what I mean.All in all not a horrible movie, but not a good one. I feel with better direction and a more meaty script it could have fallen into a nice spot of an intriguing watch. It also has a very shove-climate-change-down-your-throat kind of attitude that even as someone who believes the scientists on climate change feels forced. The music is really good, but doesn't save it. This movie falls with a lot of Netflix movies into decent but disappointing."
tt3256226,"To me this movie doesn't earn this amount of bad reviews. It is a quiet movie full of hope The thing that is wrong, is the trailer luring in the wrong audience."
tt3256226,"Not to sure that this deserves its current low rating and poor reviews. Yes it has flaws, scientific, pace etc, but it is also a meditative account of loneliness, and humanity's own flaws. It is also well shot with an emotive score that is well matched to the movie. It makes you think and consider many things, which is why I expect many of the reviews are negative. Not the best when compared to a Interstellar for example, but deserves some attention."
tt3256226,"I think this movie is suffering from its departures from the almighty formula. It's beautifully filmed, directed, and acted. The script is not transparent, as most formula movies, so you don't get the luxury of letting it wash over you."
tt3256226,"How did this get made?
It's like listening to your girlfriend tell you about a boring dream she had for 90 minutes straight.
Achingly pretentious but without the artistic beauty to back it up.
Mackie struggles with Twilight level dialogue while a surprisingly graceful score beautifully frames the drama and emotion that should be there but simply isn't.
A crushing waste of everyone's time."
tt3256226,"No sense of urgency, no interesting developments, no empathy, no rockets, no IO.The balloon was the most interesting character.Utter, utter rubbish."
tt3256226,"I understand some of the frustrations with this movie, largely because of the trailer, and the fact that it was advertised to me as a horror thriller, far from it, it's a meaningful story about the end of life as we know it, one woman's challenge, and her handling of change when a man appears.Very visual, it has some poignant scenes, I particularly liked the decayed and rotten streets and buildings, they looked incredible.There are multiple messages here, I appreciate that in amongst the many negative ones, there is one that shines through the whole way through, human spirit.Tragic beauty, 7/10."
tt3256226,The amount of the stuff happens in this movie is perfect for a short film. Unfortunately it is now just 90 minutes of boredom.
tt3256226,"Why make this movie? There is nothing worth telling here. One of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Unlikable main character. Stupid story. Stupid title. I just really don't understand the movie making process. I mean someone read this and said yeah this will make a great movie... I just truly can't believe that. Or I can't believe that person would have the power or resources to make said movie. So Netflix ""originals"" are quantity over quality i guess? My god this was flaming trash."
tt3256226,"I think the problem is it that it's moody and dark. I am reminded of how many people rejected my love of Pink Floyd and Roger Waters in college; ""but it's so depressing"" they say. No, not really. And everything ends on an up note which only works after the terribleness.Io ends on hope. I don't need sunny days and trite, maudlin music to make me feel that things are now awesome and hopeful. All you have to do as actually watch, listen, feel what is happening in the movie.It also doesn't lack in action. It lacks in action /tropes/. You could simply overlay a different Action Soundtrack to emphasize the beats as they set out on the road, find the supplies they need, find the big secret (never that big a secret) and more.But instead of playing like a disaster movie, the movie deliberately has a tone appropriate to lonely folks after the fall of the earth. It's is quiet, measured, a tinge of desperation, not depressing.I am only disappointed in how everyone else seems to hate it."
tt3256226,"This a good sci-fi movie, starts on a slow note and keeps the pace with good scenes and storyline.. I don't know why the rating is so low.."
tt3256226,"This looked promising from the trailer but delivered absolutely nothing. I kept waiting for the story to get moving, then I realized that the film was 75% over. It was incredibly boring, the story was nonsensical, and the characters were completely uninspired. Don't waste your time."
tt3256226,"""When you tell a story, here's a good idea: HAVE A POINT!""This was a nothing sandwich. A huge slab of nothing wedged between a slice of apocalyptic earth and a slice of space exploration, seasoned with metaphysical gobbledygook."
tt3256226,After watching the trailer that i give 10 out of 10 for fooling everyone i was hoping for an epic film like the Martian but in reverse but i was so wrong! This film is so boring but i try to always see them though. Don't waste your time with this one!
tt3256226,"I love syfi stuff. This was well acted and I did not mind the slow movement of the movie. But it seemed to be a snapshot in the middle of a story. It felt like an incomplete thought. I wish there was more. Either at the beginning or end. Anyway, it was not satifying. No purpose or hope. Wish there was."
tt3256226,"I really enjoyed the slow pace and contemplative mood of this movie. If you don't necessarily need any starship battles, aliens or futuristic tech stuff in a sci-fi movie and you appreciate characters that don't fit the usual hollywood template for that genre I'd highly recommend you give this a try!"
tt3256226,"Warning: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE
I was wondering what was motive or purpose of the director behind making this movie. I mean what is it? The trailer was more interested than the whole movie. Wasted one and half hour of my beautiful life on this beautiful earth."
tt6572702,"This movie is not worth the 1 & 2 star ratings. It is not one of the best animated movies, but I have seen worse.The animation is really good. There's some interesting character designs and beautiful environments.There's some funny bits across the movie (not the farting jokes! - it was so overused) & the drama is a little over the top at times, but overall it is just a fun movie."
tt6572702,"I'm watching it right now on Netflix with my kids and I started Googling to see if this was originally in another language, but it doesn't appear so. The animation to match mouth movement and voice acting is sooooo bad. At first I was surprised it wasn't too low-budget looking (I don't think this went to theaters in the US), but they need to tune up this aspect. My kids will watch almost anything so they seem unfazed, but really poor quality."
tt6572702,"I don't think I've ever seen a worse movie in a cinema. I watch loads of movies and saying this means a lot from me. I'm extremely dismissive of movie mistakes and plot-holes, but this, oh boy. It's loud, it's obnoxious, it has scenes that go on for too long. This movie has no plot, no structure no nothing. Yes, I understand this is a kids movie, but at least have the movie make sense. In fact, the movie is so terrible, in the first 30 minutes or so I left because I couldn't stand it anymore.TL;DR, don't go to see this movie, not even with your children, they will most likely not like it either."
tt6572702,"Quite possibly the worst film I've ever had the misfortune of sitting through. Even the vocal talents of Jason Isaacs and Celia Imrie couldn't save it. Appalling script, cast sound as though they'd be more excited to read the phone book, rehashed storyline, endless fart jokes.One kid liked the bats, the other fell asleep after 30mins.If you want a decent monster movie - stick with the likes of Hotel Transylvania and avoid this like the plague. Suggest Sky stick with their monstrous prices and leave the monster movies to the experts."
tt6572702,"What I learned from the reviews is that I should never skip a movie just because people hate it or didn't understand the movie or didn't even watch it but they left a negative review and now the movie should be thrown away in junk.
I really like this movie and I actually enjoyed watching it , even if you think this movie isn't suitable for the kids, it still teaches us that no matter what life throws at us and how many problems we have, we must stick together and don't let anything ruin our little family, after all, we're a family and we're the happiest around our family members, even when we have problems and even when we're not getting along pretty well - we should NOT GIVE UP on our FAMILY !
If you ask me , that's a pretty valuable lesson which should be learned even before people decide to have their own ..."
tt6572702,"I thought this movie was going to be a fun, thrilling adventure. Well I thought wrong. This movie is loaded with boredom. It over uses the same joke. And it was just not fitting. Terrible. Just terrible. Don't waste your time like I did."
tt6572702,"I love Sky. They are innovative and provide great entertainment usually. Not here though. This is a shocker of a film. The voice acting from all involved is diabolical. Nothing makes sense. Why is everyone English in New York???? Just terrible. No story, nothing funny, just horrendous.
Avoid!!!!!!!!!!"
tt6572702,"Came up on Netflic, figured we'do give it a try. An adult and 9 year old watched it. Sat through the whole thing. We both agreed it was a cute movie. We'do probably watch again.Note: The 9 year old stopped watching animated movies years ago, so her willingness to watch again says a lot."
tt6572702,"My son has asked to watch this movie several times, on our streaming service. There are definitely a lot of valid points made in other reviews. However, the majority of these go right over his head. I could pick this movie apart, but ultimately it does what it's meant to. Entertain."
tt6572702,Stupidest storyline I've ever seen. Forsed and unrealistic. Annoying.
tt6572702,Was excited to see this with my children but it was terrible. Bad acting and the voices looked dubbed turned it off after 30 minutes.
tt6572702,"We settled down as a family to watch this and at the end we all looked at each other agog, with not a laugh throughout, and commented on how awful the film was.Not sure which age-group this appeals to but with the endless 'fart jokes' it must be the very young.The film lacked warmth and the ability to appeal to a broad spectrum of age ranges and many good recent animated films have done.I honestly can't recommend spending any money on this at the cinema and even if you're have the option to watch this via Sky Movies on a subscription there really is very little to recommend - it's 90 minutes of your life you won't get back.The reason I've given it 2 stars is the animation is good and the fact Sky have tried to make original content,"
tt6572702,"Honestly it's a good ""Halloween time"" movie to add as a filler.
Considering it's originally in the German the, the lip sync isn't too terrible and there's not much that can be done about it (there's plenty of foreign dubbed movies on Netflix)
The animation isn't too terrible either! Hoodwinked has academy acclaimed award winning voice actors and the animation on that was in the pits."
tt6572702,This film is awful. The lip/voice sync is so frustrating it makes it unwatchable. The story line is non existent. The characters are so one dimensional they aren't likeable. The same ones are used over and over again. They weren't funny the first time.
tt6572702,"This movie is extremely unique in one way and one way only: animation of black characters. There are only two and they are so minor they don't matter. One never eveb speaks. However they are perfectly animated. As a 25 yoblack woman that loves animation I have never seen such well done characters. The hair texture, facial features, and beautiful skin tone made the entire movie for me. They need to do an entire movie with black kids and I guarantee it would be a successful. They were beautifully done. Normally, it's weird or European hair, grey looking dark skin or just a light skinned black person as a cop out. They usually just end up being trope. love that they took so much care when creating these minor characters."
tt6572702,Just wasted 1&1/2 hours of our lives. My hole family didn't laugh once. Very bad movie
tt6572702,"Extremely poor. Voiceovers dreadful, storyline pityful; not sure adultery really makes for good family viewing."
tt6572702,It's like everybody working on the film hated themselves and wanted the audience to suffer. Emily Watson's voice acting was astoundingly poor.
