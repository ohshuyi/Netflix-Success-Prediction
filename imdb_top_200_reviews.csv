tt0903747,"I have never watched a show that is as consistently genuine and engaging as Breaking Bad. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever, and it consistently improves as it progresses.The Journeys of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are unforgettable. These are some of the best-written characters to ever come from a pen-hitting paper.My praises for the acting and cinematography are unending. Some of the shots are intricate works of art, and I was rarely distracted by the acting. The performances are excellent to the extent that it feels improper to refer to them as performances.Overall, Breaking Bad consistently maintains a level of engagement and technical quality seen in only the best of movies, and in terms of tone, every intense moment is executed with excellence and always achieves the impact it reaches for.I feel like the show's plot in the early seasons lacks a certain level of complexity due to it not having a vast amount of plot threads, and the start is a bit slow-paced, but Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch. If you have mixed feelings towards Season 1, trust me, it is only uphill from there.If there was ever a series you could call perfect, I think this might be it."
tt0903747,Re-Watched it 7 times and counting. I guess I liked it.
tt0903747,"One of the greatest shows ever, the pacing is excellent. The characters are well developed and entertaining. The show ties everything together very neatly. It's honestly a show that get's better each time you view it. It's cathartic to see Walter break bad and how the story unravels is the best way it could have. Very good storytelling, well done to Vince Gilligan."
tt0903747,I cannot stress enough how good this show is. I've watched a lot of TV in my life and this show still remains the best show I've ever seen.
tt0903747,"Breaking Bad is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the greatest tv shows ever created...it's damn near perfect! I know that people say that about a ton of different shows but Breaking Bad really is universally thought of as one of the greatest shows of all-time. All you have to do is go google ""greatest tv shows of all-time"" and I guarantee you that it's at or near the top of every list you'll find and there's a reason for that...because it is! Every season is just as brilliant as the others, which everyone knows is almost impossible for a show to do but one which Breaking Bad absolutely pulls off!! If you're one of the few people who still haven't seen this amazing show then do yourself a favor and go watch this immediately...you will not be disappointed!"
tt0903747,When you finish the show you'll never be the same..I guarantee you
tt0903747,Breaking Bad is every bit as good as everyone says it is. It's easily one of my favorites shows of all-time and one of the best shows in the history of television. Just read through the reviews and look at the 9.5 rating to see how loved this show really is. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special. I love this show so much that I've already watched it all the way through twice already and plan on doing so again sometime in the near future. There's nothing more I can say about this incredible show that hasn't already been said so just go watch it. But plan ahead to give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge this as quickly as you can. It's addicting once you start!
tt0903747,I wanna delete my brain and watch it again like I never knew it.
tt0903747,Direction- PERFECT!!Screenplay-PERFECT!!Writing-PERFECT!!Score-PERFECT!!Cinematography-PERFECT!!Casting-PERFECT!!Beginning-PERFECT!!Climax-PERFECT!!Acting-BEYOND PERFECT!!Overall-(as I said) ABSOLUTE PERFECTION.

tt0903747,"If i say that it was good , but not excellent , every fan will try to kill me , but it's my opinion"
tt0903747,I watched like 4 episodes but then I dropped it. It had bit of some thriller scenes but not quite like I expected. Idk if I should keep watching it
tt0903747,"'Breaking Bad' is one of the most popular rated shows on IMDb, is one of those rarities where every season has either been very positively received or near-universally acclaimed critically and where all of my friends have said nothing but great things about.Very few shows in recent memory had me so hooked from the very start that before the week was over the whole show had been watched, especially when for a lot of shows now airing watching one episode all the way through can be an endeavour. 'Breaking Bad' had that effect on me, and its reputation as one of the best, consistently brilliant and most addictive shows in many years (maybe even ever) is more than deserved in my eyes. Its weakest season is perhaps the first season, understandable as any show's first season is the one where things are still settling.Actually everything is established remarkably from the very start, but once the writing and characterisation becomes even meatier the show reaches even higher levels.Visually, 'Breaking Bad' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.The writing for 'Breaking Bad' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The direction couldn't be better.Can't say anything bad about the acting. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal as one of the most fascinating anti-heroes, or even of any kind of character, in either film or television. Aaron Paul has never been better and Anna Gunn is affecting. The characters are compelling in their realism.Overall, describing it as brilliant doesn't do 'Breaking Bad' justice. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0903747,"If you are among the few who haven't seen it yet: believe the hype, it really is THAT good. Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.The show plays like the daydream fantasy of any underachieving, struggling middle class family man who's had to bury all his dreams (I mean: who wouldn't want to be a meth-kingpin for a little while?), before it turns into a nightmare. One could almost say that 'Heisenberg' is Walter White's 'Tyler Durden'(for those who don't get the reference: watch 'Fight Club' - you won't regret it).For pure entertainment value, this is simply the best show I've ever seen. Every single one of the main characters has already reached the status of a screen icon - when does that ever happen?! Most fun I've ever had watching a TV-show and an instant classic."
tt0903747,"Breaking Bad feels like fever dream. A really REALLY good fever dream. The directing is absolutely perfect. The characters bounce off each other in this really well done way. I can really feel the true emotion and pure character coming from each one. I can feel the greed, lust, money hunger animals each of these characters are. There are no true heroes in this story (except hank I love u)."
tt0903747,Nothing compares. Nothing comes close.I may currently be on my 20th dose of this show and it's still as addictive and beautiful as the first time.
tt0903747,I was waiting to see how GOT ended. It should be the greatest but they failed miserably in the finale season especially the last 3 (mainly the finale) episode.Writers need to take notes and be more like breaking bad. They had they ending planned out from the begging. They didn't try and build a massive brand or following behind the show and extend their seasons to do so. They stuck with their plan and created the greatest show we may ever see.Thank you for existing.
tt0903747,"If there is any show deserves a 10/10, it's Breaking Bad, Simply the greatest."
tt0903747,"I usually don't comment on here but this show is the best I've seen in my life. And I've seen a lot of shows. The setting, character development and the actors... everything is pitch perfect. I'm on my fourth run through this show and I still love it. There's no other show out there I can watch this many times and still be excited. The dynamic between Walter and Jesse is awesome. I will watch this show once a year and I never get bored. Forget about the hyped shows you'll only watch once. This is the one and only you should watch right now If you haven't already. The only show that got me this excited in the last decade was Dark.Just look at the rating for breaking bad and you'll know what's up. Not many shows can hold up this rating for so long."
tt0903747,"Ok, so while it isn't quite the holy grail it's made out to be, 'Breaking Bad' is a solid series. I give it a concrete 7. It is well worth watching. It absolutely IS a good series. Just allow for a steady stream of implausible moments throughout the series where various story points just aren't remotely believable.
Enjoy the good (there is plenty), and look over the ludicrous (there is plenty). Enjoy the show."
tt0903747,"....you like the first few episodes. If you do, then great. If you don't, you will do what I did and waste a lot of time going through some tedious and mind numbing TV, constantly waiting for it to get better. It didn't for me. I didn't like any characters, the pace was painfully slow at times, episodes can be missed entirely and no one would care (fly!), and there was a lot of filler. I will say, the way it ended was excellent, but not enough for me to recommend sitting through series 1-4 to watch it"
tt0903747,"I probably haven't been hooked to a TV show like I am to Breaking Bad before. This beautiful piece of art is incredibly well written and directed, furthermore the actors are doing a tremendous job! I've read a few remarks about the pace of the show, saying it is too slow. I completely disagree, there are so many aspects which get their place in the series, every single one in its own way and it would be horrible if we'd see a too fast paced show containing ridiculous cliffhangers like we see them on the major networks. Because this way you can entirely fall in love with the show, the characters and every tiny detail of the story and the best part of it, it is unbelievably addictive and makes you starve for more week after week! 10/10 Kudos to Mr. Gilligan, kudos to Mr. Cranston and kudos to everyone else who's making a contribution to this show!"
tt0417299,"I don't know when, but for me, Netflix started streaming Avatar and I was like my childhood, It calls to me. As I mentioned I'm sitting here alone in my apartment in quarantine rewatching my favorite show from when I was in middle school. 14 years later and as an adult I'm sitting here crying because of all the emotion that's portrayed in every episode. It's just so real. It might be the massive amounts of alcohol that I'm consuming on my own but I swear, this show is so heartfelt and raw. Practically every episode tackles loss, friendship, bravery and humility all tied in with some friendly humor. The show holds up so well. 10/10 would recommend even without the wine."
tt0417299,"This is show is one of the best shows ever created. There are many great lessons in this show that all people (adults and kids) should learn. The show delves into many branches of philosophy, including moral philosophy, that teaches people how to think critically and to always help and understand others. The show has a fantastic plot filled with great comedy and character development. The show has great action scenes as well! I highly recommend this show to everyone!"
tt0417299,"OK, so I was 12 when this show came out and needless to say, I was completely enamored by it. For a TV station like Nickelodeon, best known for its wacky shows like SpongeBob, Rocko's Modern Life and their sitcoms like Drake and Josh, to suddenly come out with this anime-inspired animated series with deep philosophical themes as well as tackling genocide and war, this was a massive step forward.Of course, this isn't the first form of media that has incorporated the power of the elements, but their method of how they do it here is remarkable. For every element to be adopted into its own nation, reflecting the psyches and philosophies attributed to the respective element is truly inspiring.All the characters are written for and performed expertly, save for maybe some of the guest characters (*cough cough* Jet). My favourite character by far is Zuko. The progression and development of this character is incredible and captures perfectly the transition from villain to antihero to hero. Aang is a good character too, but he's a bit of a goody-two-shoes half the time. Katara and Sokka are equally appealing characters, as well as Toph.The brilliance of this show is that it is perfectly paced. Sure, you get the occasional filler episode, but every episode (leaving out The Great Divide) has a purpose and adds more layers to this intriguing story and the world it is set in.Again, for a children's show to incorporate seriously heavy topics and still have a silly sense of humour is just impressive. I get annoyed every time someone stereotypes this series as just a 'kids show', brushing it off. This show can be watched by someone of any age, and that is one of the reasons I admire it so much. It's not pandering at all and tackles the heavy subject matter in a mature way.Sadly, after The Legend of Korra, Nickelodeon never seemed to follow in the footsteps of Avatar which I found upsetting. Kids need more shows like this, if I'm being honest."
tt0417299,"I'm not big on cartoons or the like but my husband had been asking me for years to watch the avatar. Well it came to Netflix so I said ok begrudgingly, thinking it was more so a show for him to enjoy his nostalgia and I definitely didn't think it would be enjoyable to see as an adult, assuming it was a kids show.I was very wrong! I loved the show, it's def one of my favorites. So wish there was more! It is humorous and touching, generally it put me in a good mood afterwards. I'll def rewatch it.The characters are all interesting and have great development. Scenes are beautiful. It's just a great show. Give it a watch!!"
tt0417299,"Even though Avatar is of American origin, it has a lot of Japanese anime influence, particularly visually, but keeps the best of both animation cultures with it's American sense of playfulness and more realized characterization. The creators of Avatar have really crafted an artistic piece of fun and creative storytelling that is a rare gem for American TV. Avatar has strength in all the major areas of film and story, starting at ground level with an exceptionally believable world setting where war is taking place among the different nations. The main characters who find themselves caught in this struggle are three teens named Katara, Sokka, and Aang (the Avatar) who have set forth to bring harmony to the world through their influence and through the powers of the still developing Avatar. There is lot of humor and fun in this show, and you can't help but to really love these characters and their pets. But this is just the beginning of the glue that keeps you coming back. Great plots and stunning visuals are just as much of importance to the overall success of the show. The story lines are top notch, being both episodic in nature and chronologically integral from one show to the next. Each episode usually introduces a new and genuinely interesting opposition and/or characters to be overcome by the end of the show, and visually there is plenty of awe inspiring backgrounds and quality animation. With just enough well paced action, some sincere points of moral conviction (can you believe it), and witty humor makes the show a winning combination. This is entertainment for all ages, and definitely a must see."
tt0417299,"This review will be very long. I adore this show with every fibre of my being, and view it to be a piece of animated perfection. I implore people to avoid the disgusting live-action adaptation by director M. Night Shyamalan, as it is a disrespectful sham that mocks everything that the show stood for and mastered.So as for the show itself, where to begin? Well let's start with the story overall. Avatar tells a complete a perfectly paced epic plot over the course of 61 22 minute episodes. The show contains several unique and beautifully detailed characters among its main cast, all of whom are given consistent and engaging development throughout. From family related guilt and angst, identity dilemmas and the characters constant, overarching and looming quest, the characters are pressed with many trials which actually truly change them over the course of their magnificent journey. Aside from the primary cast, many intriguing and varied side characters appear throughout the adventure. They offer comedic levity, new forms of drama and help to add to the deep mythological and philosophical backbone of the show. All characters are exquisitely written and voice acted, with not a badly portrayed among them. Next I will cover the show's borderline legendary animation. It is a sight to behold indeed. I believe I am justified in believing that such stellar production values will never again be pared with this level of artistic imagination again, at least not in my lifetime. The scope, creativity and energy of the shows animation is second to no other show, and it's balance of colour is never anything less than sublime. Aside from sweeping and moving visuals, Avatar also offers fast paced and unbelievably well choreographed action scenes (once again, second to none) and well timed slapstick comedy. Not only is the animation stunning, it is also staggeringly versatile. The show's epic mythos is also very strong, and demands to be deepened and added to (thankfully Korra is doing just that). It takes inspiration from Buddhist, Inuit, Western, Japanese and Korean cultures to deliver it's unique world, as well as many original and creative elements in conjunction with the more recognisable real world concepts. The show manages to weave philosophy and deep moral concepts within its world and characters, creating one of the most fleshed out fantasy worlds of the last several decades. In conclusion, what can I even say? I love Avatar: TLA more every time I experience it, and it is one of very few shows (or even films) which can provoke a primal emotional response from me each time I see it, without fail. It sends shivers down my spine, and puts a tear to my eye, leaving me totally satisfied and fulfilled each time. My favourite television show, of all time."
tt0417299,"I love it, it's amazing. It did have a few weaker episodes, but overall I can easily say this is one of the best anime I've ever seen. Most memorable too. The protagonists were very relatable and easy to root for. Although the show tried to convince us that ""the Avatar team members"" were just kids, they all looked and acted at least a few years older, especially Aang (he really doesn't sell a 12-year-old kid, especially in season 2 and 3). But that's a good thing. I liked it better for it. Prince Zuko is another great example. He was supposed to be around 16, but seemed more like 18, if not even 19. Again, I preferred it this way.Characters' archers were done splendidly. Especially Zuko's. His journey was by far the most transforming and I liked how he struggled to choose between good and evil. Aang's crush on Katara was cute at first, and I thought nothing of it, but then it has developed into something more, even if it did take a long time for it. Their love was definitely something to root for.And last but not least, Sokka and Toph. Both were absolutely amazing. One a warrior with a fun side, always saying something funny, but also really looking out for his sister and other friends, and the other a blind girl with unimaginable power. Even animal companions had their own characters. Loved it. And the finale! It was amazing. One of the best ones in the history of TV shows. ""Avatar"" really built up to it. Just go see it. I couldn't recommend more.PS: If you haven't watched yet ""The Legend of Korra"", which is supposed to be Avatar's sequel, please don't. It destroys everything ""The Last Airbender"" holds dear. You'll just end up depressed. instead, pretend it doesn't exist. Trust me, it's better this way."
tt0417299,"Avatar The Last Airbender shouldn't be underestimated. For a while I didn't even look twice at it due to it being on Nickelodeon and me being past the age of watching anything on Nick aside from the classic Nicktoons or Nick shows from the 1990s. But word got around that it was really fantastic, a sort of Kung fu style show where a master goes from place to place having adventures. Turns out the people I heard the word from weren't kidding: the saga of Aang, the last airbender and Avatar, who masters the four elements (air, earth, water, fire) and has to save the world by stopping the power-hungry fire lord, Ozai, is as epic as anything I've ever seen. It's an achievement of storytelling that creeps up on you, and while the first season isn't perfect the second season delivers episode after episode that enriches the characters and makes us care about them as we would in, for obvious example, Star Wars.In fact, the only minor complaint I would have against the second season (not sure yet about the third) is that it borrows quite heavily from the Empire Stikes Back (i.e. the 'one-who-will-save-us-all' mythology from Joseph Campbell is off training with an old master, feels his friend(s) in pain and danger in the future, rushes off before finishing training, bad things ensue, etc). But really, all of the characters get developed quite well, and if anything the development of the character Prince Zuko, a scarred son of Ozai who has been banished until he can bring back the Avatar along with his banished uncle Iroh, is astonishing in its complexity. We don't care about this character at first, in the first season he comes off like a whiner with Iroh as the wonderful comic relief (think Pokemon if the brother and sister weren't so annoying). But by season two a whole other dimension comes into play: who are you, and what are you doing with yourself? The trek with the three main characters, and the extra characters like Toph (a little blind girl who is one of those great bad-asses you have to see to believe), is one that is sophisticated enough to bring in adults, and for kids it's often just rollicking fun when it isn't deep or dark. The villains are convincing and scary, the humor hits when it needs to (and sometimes it can be just downright trippy and hilarious, like the second episode of season two, the Cave of Two Lovers), and the animation is often breathtaking. As they say on the internet now: it's made of Win!"
tt0417299,"I grew up with this show and I can't imagine my life without it. It truly is not only the best cartoon series, but also one of the best series out there. With an incredible story, beautiful animation, amazing characters, great villains and awesome action sequences, it's simply flawless in every way possible.Season 1 starts off slowly but only because of the terrific character introductions and world building, introducing the lovable team of protagonists, Aang, Katara and Sokka, being chased by the angsty Prince Zuko, accompanied by his adorable and wise uncle.Season 2 is probably the best of the three, and introduces an awesome new character, Toph, and a perfect new villain, Azula. The animation also improves and is packed with action, emotion and epicness.The Final Season is also magnificent and the characters are at their best at this point, and so is the animation quality.Overall this show is a must! I've shown it to several kids and adults alike and they always end up getting hooked."
tt0417299,"Hi there.It is September 2016, more than a decade this this series was done, and I will be your reviewer this evening.Our menu is simple -- we are only offering just one review and that review only comes with the very rare ""perfect score"" of 10. Sorry, no substitutions.I am a prolific reviewer here (over 1350 reviews) which is a polite way of saying I watch too much TV and have too much time on my hands.When I first watched this series I made the same ""mistake"" most reviewers do when reviewing anything for the first time. As good as it was, I ""assumed"" that over time something better would appear. But that never happened.So after 10 years I have given up. I just rewatched the whole series top to bottom and currently have a nice endorphin buzz going because this astonishing series just gets better as you go, and the final episode just plants a big smile on your face.Perfect writing, direction, story, dialog, animation, characters. And all with a chewy moral center.(And some really deep metaphysical concepts -- like the island where everything is connected. That is a reference to one of the oldest religions in the world.)I know what you are thinking. I tried to get into Korra but all I kept seeing there were the many errors the producers made in trying to improve on something which simply cannot be improved on.It is official. I am calling it.The best overall series in the history of TV.And it just gets better with age.((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer."" Please check out my list ""167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))"
tt0417299,"This is a anime style cartoon that kids and adults will enjoy watching. It really is one of the best cartoon show I seen in a while, there is little to almost no flaw to this show. I really wished it was longer though, instead of just 3 seasons. It really is a memorable adventure, which has many elements that will keep your attention from beginning to end. Plus just about every characters in this show is memorable and not just the main characters either, and for a bunch of cartoon characters I actually cared about what happens to them. One of the best animated series I seen, and I highly recommend anyone that enjoys a good story in a cartoon to watch this amazing show.9.3/10"
tt0417299,I thought that Avatar when it first came out was gonna be another Nick Show flop. When the first episode came out I watched it for about 10 mins. and I thought wow and couldn't stop watching. The show I think keeps you involved. Nick has picked some bad shows but not this one. The plot is very well designed and characters are thought out and are dynamic. I think thats what makes a show good. Also the fact that when a show ends then next time then it carrys on what happened in the next episode rather than acting like it never happened. The show captures a sense of reality and makes the audience more into it. The writers write some pretty decent material. Classic comedy and new moral comedy with good values. All in all I give the show a perfect score of 10/10 stars with both thumbs way up.
tt0417299,"I've been watching this with my 5-year-old and find it's watchable by both adults and kids. The writing and dialog aren't wooden or simplistic. Although it's not at the depth of an Aaron Sorkin show, there is intrigue and nuance in the conflicts between Aang and his adversaries as well as among the adversaries themselves.It's this kind of writing that can absorb and involve a first-grader yet not drive his parents up a wall that makes this more interesting to watch than say a ""Fairly Odd Parents"" or Disney's ""Aaron Stone"". These are writers/creators who trust their audience to ""get it"" and who try to keep things accessible without talking down to the audience. That takes both talent and skill."
tt0417299,"It's a well-written children's show. And if I were eight, I'd probably have rated it considerably higher. Or if it were being recommended to me by 8 year olds, or FOR 8 year olds. What's baffling is the number of adults recommending this to other adults, as if it weren't a children's show.I gave it an honest effort. I got most of the way through the first season, very nearly to the end, because multiple people had told me it gets SO GOOD. But really, it's a children's show. It may get good for a children's show, but as an adult it has virtually no appeal. The protagonists are annoying children, who do the same annoying crap every episode. The antagonist is an annoying child, who does the same annoying crap every episode. Mako is an absolute delight as the uncle, but that's like saying the ocean was wet. Mako is ALWAYS a win. He is a goddamned national treasure. Mako aside though (and I am starting to feel like a broken record), it is a children's show. There is absolutely nothing in this for adults, unless it is the nostalgia for young adults who watched this and fell in love with it WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN.So if you watched this as a child and loved it, apparently it really holds up and you'll probably love it again. If you're a child, for god's sake stop reading this review and go watch it. I'm sure it's fantastic. However, if you're an adult being told by other adults that this is SO GOOD, do yourself a favor and ignore them. It's a children's show, there's nothing in it you'll enjoy."
tt0417299,"Where to begin with this series, despite being a series made for children, this is one of those rare shows that could be enjoyed by all ages. The journey that Aang and his team experience is some of the best character development I have seen with a particular praise for the redemption arc of a certain character which is the BEST redemption arc on television. The series tackles a lot of adult con-tent with humorous segments sprinkled in which helps balances the series out with a fantastic world not unlike anything else on television. There is a reason as to why this show has has persisted in the publics' memory and you have to see this to truly experience the legend of the last Airbender."
tt0417299,"The art and research put into this story matches the quality of the plot and character development. This show is what Nickelodeon needs to give it some respect. Not since Samauri Jack has an American show been able to pull off an anime style that works. It's good to know that children that watch this show may actually learn what it takes to have a good story. The research put into the story is amazing. The bending styles all coincide with different styles of fighting and can be seen in every episode. The show itself is also planned out, as minor questions formed in one episode may not be answered for another 10 some episodes later, so it's not just another Nick ""story"" show like Danny Phantom, all episodes are connected and well planned out. I wouldn't doubt that the next 3 seasons are already written. The character development and writing can match even some of the best television writers out there, it may even be able to stand toe-to-toe with the works of Joss Whedon.I give the show an easy 10/10, especially if you watch all the shows in order."
tt0417299,"The series that I watched once and thought it was the greatest thing since sliced Pao (Indian bread). Loved it and Recommended it to all my pals and not one person has failed to fall in love with this epic. I ranted and raved about it wherever I went.Then, life took over and I didn't have the time to think about or revisit the original Avatar : The Last Airbender.Until last week, I tuned in again. I finished the episodes by the fistful, completing 3 complete seasons in 3 days.I never thought I would miss my friends so much because by the end of this series thats what the characters will be to you. I cannot express the sadness that creeped in over the last episode when I knew it was all going to come to an end. I would no longer get to see the wonderful lives of all characters I had grown to adore & take into confidence.Watching & experiencing this series has been one the most affirming moments of my life.I beg you not to go without experiencing the brilliant epic that is Avatar : The Last Airbender."
tt0417299,"Utterly fantastic show. Here are the things i love the most (trust me there are even more)
Character development!!! Zuko is one of my favorite characters of all time. His redemption arc is awesome.Character moments. For example: Iroh forgiving Zuko. Need i say more?Visuals.Humor. Drink cactus juice!it's technically a kids show, but it's really for anyone.Compelling villians. I think azula is even scarier than the Firelord himself hahahaThe score!Satisfying Ending.Ok i think you get the idea.... Basically everything is great."
tt0417299,"Avatar: The Last Airbender is a very mature show that can be enjoyed at any age. This show has some of the greatest characters of all time and all of them go through realistic character arcs that natural. Gorgeous animation and amazing music give the show a cinematic feel. Despite an incredible first season, each season improves its quality greatly and doesn't cease to surprise and amaze me. Avatar: The Last Airbender is a perfect animated show."
tt0417299,"I just re-watched this series that was my childhood and feel the need to express some feelings. This is the greatest thing ever created, period. All these other reviews can only barely say how i feel about this show. If there is one thing you must do before you die, this is it. There is literally nothing else you could watch, see, hear, do etc. that could top this experience. Have a nice day.
i mean me to thanks"
tt0417299,"It is amazing. Truly amazing.No matter what episode you start on, you get instantly hooked and wanting more. I've probably watched this show 10 times because there is truly nothing else like it. If there is, I have yet to find it. It may sound silly but this show holds a special place in my heart because that is how much I adore it."
tt0417299,"Recently, I replied to a thread on the Rocko's Modern Life boards, and I was absolutely shocked to learn that there were those who considered this as Nick's worst. Sorry, I disagree completely. Avatar:The Last Airbender in my opinion doesn't deserve to be included down there with ChalkZone and Rocket Power, if anything this is one of Nick's best shows along with Rocko's Modern Life, Ren and Stimpy and Angry Beavers.The concept may appear simple and basic on paper, but as the show progresses the storytelling is grander, more epic and perhaps even more powerful. The animation is excellent, the music is great, the writing is consistently strong and the stories are outstanding in my opinion. And the characters, heroes and villains, have depth to them and are very likable. Avatar:The Last Airbender also benefits from superb voice work.In conclusion, this is a brilliant show and somewhat underestimated. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0417299,"I never thought I'd say this, but this is one of the best things ever on TV. It is so mature, yet so childish; the perfect balance suitable for anyone. I am 16y old, and I find this show fascinating. There is so much wisdom in it, yet collided with humor and plain stupidity that you just can't say 'No' to this show. I am just glad they ended it the way they did, without bumping out the money of him, like people did to many shows. It started so naively, and ended so gloriously. What really made this show are characters; each and every one of them - from the king of the Earth Kingdom, to the very Avatar. There's a mix of 'sweet love' of childhood, 'sweet pain' of it, yet there are losses, honesty, discovery of the depths of the souls and so much more.I watched whole three seasons in three days, and I was swallowing all that I could get. Of course, I will watch show again, slowly, to consume all that it can offer. But from what I've seen, I know that this show is something that everyone should watch. It offers so much fun for the younger ones, so much guidance and wisdom for the teens of my age, and yet so much of everything for the elder ones. It is no wonder this show has great rating on IMDb, but I think it deserves even more, just because it IS the BEST on the world.If you didn't watch it, go buy it, WATCH IT NOW, you won't regret ONE SECOND of the time you watched it. 100 out of 10; even more."
tt0417299,"I remember watching this show when I was a kid, and I used to midly enjoy it (meaning if it was on, I'd watch it but if it wasn't, I wouldn't be upset about it). I recently decided to re-watch it cause I thought it would be nostalgic and bring back memories for me. I was disappointed when I watched almost the first two seasons, and realised how bad the show actually was. The animation style is good, and the story is also pretty good, but for some reason, watching it felt like a chore and even though I tried to force myself to watch it, I couldn't because of how boring it was.No hate to ATLA fans because I know how hyped up people get about the show, but it just wasn't it for me."
tt9471404,"I'm honestly really impressed by what the makers of this show have accomplished. It's such a unique take that they've given to the story, this sort of ""street-level view"" of those people that encountered Jesus. Reading these stories in the Bible again and again makes it easy to become detached from the fact that these were real people living real lives dealing with real struggles, going to work, hanging with friends, making jokes, eating lunch, and stepping in animal poop 😂 but they've brought it all to life in an engaging and relatable way where the tight budget seldom shows.I love that this show doesn't feel preachy, like most Christian media. The way the camera kind of bobs and sways as it follows the action lends an almost documentarian vibe that makes me feel like I'm simply witnessing a story unfold. No agenda. No sermon. Just good old fashioned storytelling. Of course, we know that there is a very profound message to it all, but the filmmakers are smart enough to let the audience figure it out for themselves without thumping them over the head with ""Christian talk.""The actor portraying Jesus does so with an unflinching kindness and empathy that makes him instantly trustworthy and lovable in every. single. scene. So props to him for his amazing work and props to the casting team for finding him!This is a great show that, even if not suited to everyone's tastes, is bound to challenge our mental perception of these people and their stories. It makes these characters feel real, brings Jesus to life in a new way, and has some fun with artistic license while still honoring God's Word.Christian filmmakers take note: THIS is how you do it!"
tt9471404,"Love how human the Chosen are! Totally relatable in today's world and they could have been any one of us. Thank you for this wonderful peek into history.
A devoted fan forever! #bingeJesus"
tt9471404,"Following the progress of this idea from dream to reality, I was excited to have access to the first four episodes. This series is unlike any Biblical portrayal of the life of Christ to date - the characters are fresh and real- check out Abigail!! And a Jesus who winks! And doesn't glow or act ethereal! These first four episodes bring the Gospels to life in a way that immerses us into a culture and recounting that feels authentic. Kudos to everyone involved- I can't wait for more."
tt9471404,"Christian movies and shows aren't typically known for quality, good character development, or well-written, compelling stories. There are certainly some exceptions (e.g., The Passion of the Christ, I Can Only Imagine, Ben-Hur, I'm Not Ashamed, Faith Like Potatoes, The Case for Christ, and Narnia).To cut straight to the point: The Chosen is far and away the best on-screen depiction of the life of Christ-either mini-series or movie. The writing and character development are exceptional. It's as captivating as The Passion, yet in so many ways more human and relatable. My family and I keep re-watching them just to get one more glimpse of the Son of Man. The miracles are deeply moving and will bring you to tears.And now... the biggest problem is we'll have to wait for Season 2. The wait is going to hurt more than waiting for Stranger Things Season 3."
tt9471404,"Well-written, well-cast, well-acted. So so happy this show exists."
tt9471404,"My wife wanted me to watch The Chosen with her, and I avoided it for weeks, because I expected yet another well-intentioned but 'cheesy' Christian production. Then I finally gave in. I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG. This production is amazing! The quality of the scripts, acting, and sets are all on a par with the production values of a well-regarded Hollywood 'short season' series. And the depiction of the historical culture and the conjectural backstories for key figures around Jesus are BETTER than anything I have seen elsewhere. If you are at all curious about a fresh take on the life of Jesus that still maintains rigorous effort to remain true to the New Testament record, I would HIGHLY recommend this series!"
tt9471404,"I've viewed the Christmas/Shepherd pilot and the first four episodes of season one. The extensive research into the life and times of Christ results in a high level of authenticity. Accuracy was a prevailing priority. The characters 'personalities are slowly peeled in layers through the episodes. There's stellar portrayals of some, especially when placed in the appropriate environs, and will leave a residue long after the video stops, . You will want to see more. There is a reason this series is the highest crowd funded video project."
tt9471404,You won't be able to stop watching. It is THAT good.
tt9471404,"Is this a perfect show? No; what show is, especially in its first season? But is this a consistently entertaining, beautiful project (inside and out!) that not only brings the Bible alive, but takes a deep look at faith and what was really being asked of the 12 disciples when Jesus said, ""Follow me""? Yes, yes, and yes!The actor who plays Jesus carries this season. Not only is he incredibly gentle and solemn when he needs to be, but he is funny (like actually laugh-out-loud funny!) and that is something many depictions of Jesus lack. Jesus' human side is explored in The Chosen as I've never seen before, so wholly and fully, yet in a way that is reverent and respectful. While we can imagine the Christ portrayed here being as human as us, we can also imagine him being as God as, well, God. Brilliant actor, and probably the best portrayal of Jesus ever put to film. His performance is controlled and unassuming yet so powerful in that alone. Whenever Jesus is onscreen you are completely captivated, hanging on his every word.As far as some downsides in the show (which are in no way very glaring): Occasionally the humor did start to feel a little silly sometimes and took me out of the moment (rarely though, and never when involving Jesus and the disciples).The score, while gorgeous in itself, has a sequence of a woman performing a vocal part that I felt was overused.And I thought it a bit odd that the Roman soldiers have American accents, especially considering so much wonderful care is put into keeping the Hebrew accents so consistent. The lead ""evil Roman soldier"" fellow as well seemed cartoonish and I couldn't find him as threatening as he needed to be in this role, but rather he stood out from the others who are all far more developed and believable characters.Yet these things do not detract from what a monumental moment this is in Christian cinema, or, lets just say cinema in general. To really see these disciples as real people was an eye opener and an encouragement to read the Bible again with new eyes. The actors playing Peter, Mary Magdalene, Matthew and I'll say each of Jesus' followers were masterfully done, perfect casting, and where did they find such unknown actors with such skill? I can't overstate how happy I am with this show and I really hope the show runners can get enough funding for a season 2. They are doing what Hollywood seemingly never could!"
tt9471404,This series is just phenomenal. It speaks to the soul and represents Jesus in a wonderful and relatable light. God bless everyone behind the scenes making this show! You are changing lives!
tt9471404,"This show is really well done. The story moves at a great pace, taking time to develop characters, but still moving the story along without feeling like it's dragging out. The historical accuracy of the time period is excellent. And the actors are wonderfully cast."
tt9471404,"I was dubious about watching this due to Super Church Evangelical American involvement. Then I watched the first few minutes of episode 1.
Wow. As a Roman Catholic, I have to say that this is about watching something that brings outrageous joy. I admire the chap behind it. Different denominations but the same God who must be thrilled with this.
Magic. Spiritual. Brilliant. Love it."
tt9471404,"I was very impressed by what this team of filmmakers could do with so little. I like that they can do what they want with the show, but I hope they continue to get more professional people involved in the show. Bottom line... buy the Blu-Ray, pay-it-forward, do what you can to support it.Why did I give it a 7/10? Because frankly, I think a 9.8 and 100% is a bit much... not many professional Hollywood movies or shows deserves it. Now if we're talking just in Christian media in general... yeah, this deserves a 9.8! The writing is very good, amazing sets, and believable acting! My only qualms are occasional added dialogue or events, but there's nothing heretical about the series by any means. I'm also glad they got New Testament scholars to approve the script as well!Again, I can't stress enough, support the show!"
tt9471404,"I know... Let's add this review to my list of sins.To be fare it's not a review but an opinion.I was bored beyond i imagine during the first chapter. The whole, Holy Land theme park set me off... Even in the real theme park.Everything looks so fake, the costumes are not clothes, they are costumes and i doubt anything was as clean as it's shown in the series.The dialogues are bland and unengaging. So if this was my feeling during the first episode why would I keep watching?. As a believer, just because it's about Jesus?. No... It's slow paced and boring.Anyways, we know already how it's going to end.Right?."
tt9471404,"This is one of the most powerful experiences I have ever had in my life! What an exceptional depiction of every one of the apostles (given Matthew maybe, a little too quirky) and of our Christ as a human. Wow! Highly recommended. Nicodemus is a great character and this ALL seems so real and so very human. Great!"
tt9471404,"I usually hate Christian movies and show! They're so cheesy and boring. But this was amazing and honestly help my relationship with Jesus. It made him come ive a bit, gave him a personality and sense of humor. Yet was still biblical and not overhyped or too Hollywood.Please watch this and also check out the chosen website to see how you can support them so they can make more seasons."
tt9471404,I have seen the first four episodes! They are amazing! If you think the Bible is hard to follow this will help you understand it to depths I never imagined! Great work to everyone involved and I am honored to be a part of such an amazing blessing to all!
tt9471404,"Can't even watch this without being emotionally wrecked, moved, inspired in so many ways. This is it and it is amazingly produced. All you want is more. More, more, MORE.To see this so well done and visually depicted. It's a must watch. Binge watch. You have to watch, experience, and tell others."
tt9471404,Most accurate and moving depiction of any true story I've ever seen! The acting is so superb I find myself emotionally exhausted after each viewing. I can not get enough of this. I am so excited for the next episodes to be released!
tt9471404,"The sets, costumes, acting, and emotional responses in this series are far and above any I have ever seen in the past. Watching the episodes over and over does not in any way deter the depth of emotions both shown on screen and felt by the viewer. Jesus is portrayed as authentic, relatable, humorous, kind and patient. The series brings Him to life in a wonderful way--both as human and God."
tt9471404,"You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll want a hug from Jesus when it's all said and done!! It touched me to my core and Jesus is more alive, than ever before!!💪🙏💜"
tt9471404,"This is an incredibly powerful series. Everybody should watch this. Every time I watch it I am moved to tears and drawn closer to Christ Jesus. Brilliant casting. I've always wondered what the people who knew Him during His earthly life were like; how their relationship and with Jesus affected them. This series shows the sense of humor that Jesus has. Every encounter with the people around Him changes those people, drawing them closer to the truth."
tt9471404,"When I first saw the pilot episode for this show, I was impressed by by the cinematography and story line. I was really hopeful that finally some Christians could make a quality film about Jesus' life, and so I invested in the project. So far I will say some episodes have been better than others, especially where they build up the plot and back story of the characters to enhance the Gospel story line (that is to do justice to the Gospel story line). However, in many episodes the plot tends to run really slow and just drags out unnecessarily.From a script writing perspective, there's often no conflict, no climax, no plot hangers- just people walking around talking about how great Jesus' sermon was, and characters having small chit chat, etc (Season 3, Ep. 1). The writers really need to work on the script.While I know no film will ever do true justice to Jesus' character, I wish they could try to make Jesus' words a little less cliche at times and more in the spirit of who he was. One of the most amazing things about Jesus is that he never wasted words- he always had the perfect answer in the moment and most often answered tough questions with another witty or more profound question. The hardest questions of life, after all, can't be answered with trite cliches or simple explanations (read Job). Sometimes in the show, the Jesus character comes across as too simple and cliche in this regard.From a Biblical perspective, I will say I'm thankful they're being faithful to the spirit and essence of the Biblical message. However, even this could be improved. They often try to embellish the plot and dialogue so much in their own way without using Scripture (that ultimately turns out boring), and leave out a lot of opportunities for deep Scriptural moments. Ideally, I would suggest interweaving Scripture/ quotes of Jesus throughout the episodes and build up the plot so as to bring more color and context to Jesus' words in Scripture. After all, if you want to make the films powerful, put in more Scripture- because this is the most powerfully moving script you could ever come up with.The biggest problem is, most people barely scratch the surface of Scripture, fail to unpack the context, allusions, symbolism, imagery and foreshadowing that's in the Bible. Seriously, the Bible is the deepest, most exciting book you could ever read, but so few people see it because they barely even look. Hollywood filmmakers doing Biblical movies totally screw up the story because they're clueless to the beauty and richness of the Bible. Most Christian filmmakers, while they understand the heart of the Gospel, often come from a cheesy, superficial church background (i.e. Mainstream American Christianity), and so also fail to bring out the deep gems of Scripture in their films. What ideally needs to happen is to get some Biblical scholars together with creative film makers to make something great.One example of a Biblical film doing this excellently is the ""The Passion of the Christ""- especially in the scene where Jesus crushes the snake's head in the garden of Gethsemane. They do an excellent job of subtly bringing out the Biblical imagery here of Christ: Adam round 2, in a garden again, but this time not yielding to the serpent's temptations. Instead he obeys the Father's will, crushes the serpent's head, undoing his work and fulfilling the Genesis 3 prophecy. Seriously, film has such amazing potential to bring out the gems in Scripture and the riches of the Bible, but so few people know how to do it because they either don't see the gems or they don't know how to make good film.There was a period in history when Christian art was the best art in the world- think Bach, Handel, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, etc. Unfortunately, in our modern era Christian art, music and writing tends to be superficial, cliche and below par compared to the world's art. Unfortunately I think that stems from a superficial theology that's often taught in mainstream American churches. Ultimately, a superficial understanding of God produces superficial expressions of art. Nevertheless, there are examples of Christians still producing excellent art in our era of time (I would put Tolkien and C. S. Lewis up there), and I hope as a church we can keep getting better and better, and hopefully do better justice to the reality of God's beauty through our art."
tt9471404,"I saw it as a challenge to viewer, actors. Because it is different and , after the first reserves, it works very well. It is the Story but told in different manner, with high simplicity and profound honesty. Yes, it is the story who you know but the performances and the director vision give new perspectives. No doubts, it is not a serie to impress. But to propose a basic way to discover what you know to know. So, provocative can be a reasonable term. Like adventure, too, if you do not ignore than this trip involves so precise delicacy."
tt9471404,"Acting was definitely not 'A' list. Nor was the script. Many scenes, especially close up, made me think "" is this cameraman drunk?"" (Camera shaking) Most of the story was not actually biblically accurate. The whole production just reminded me of a minor league venture, and a corny one at that. I honestly believe that the vast majority of the 10 rating are from devout Christians (not objectionable viewers) which would make their review totally biased. If you want an 'A' List production watch The Greatest Story Ever Told, or Ben-Hur. This was certainly not close to either."
tt9253866,"How was this filmed?? I wish they make a documentary on how this documentary was filmed and edited, and what gear and technology they used."
tt9253866,"Attenborough & Netflix a match made in heaven. Shot in stunning 4K this breath taking
Nature Documentary is as good as it gets and it's message is crystal clear, Stop killing our Our Planet. Highly recommended"
tt9253866,"Like all David Attenborough's documentaries, this is absolutely beautiful and breath-taking. No one can show us how beautiful our planet is like David Attenborough... he is, quite literally, one of the most important people on Earth, and undoubtedly, the most important person TO Earth."
tt9253866,"This is absolutely brilliant, but also very very sad. Mankind must stop and protect our only home - NOW."
tt9253866,"From the majestic narration to the incredible shots of nature and landscapes to the huge amount of information about Our Planet that is given to us, this documentary series never failed to impress me and is the best Netflix documentary series I've ever seen."
tt9253866,"This is so spectacular you'll be getting flabbergasted at every turn and twist of this masterpiece. Really, who knew a fraction of these phenomena actually take place? I am just wondering how we human beings can possibly destroy it all when the chances of it all happing were so microscopic to begin with Sir Richard Attenborough is synonymous with these fine works of art. Feast upon this! You too can thrive!"
tt9253866,Amazingly filmed and narrated. Just watch it and be amazed.
tt9253866,David Attenborough nature films.. I'm there.. You can never go wrong if you're like me and impressed with Mother Nature.
tt9253866,"As if I thought Sir David couldn't do anything more to amaze me, he comes up with this. What a phenomenal 8 episode show. The man is just extraordinary."
tt9253866,"Sir David Attenborough is the best nature narrator! If we don't start taking care of our planet, we will not be able to watch amazing documentaries such as this one. Please support your local wildlife and help clean it up, volunteer in your national parks, beaches, etc. no matter what country you live in and let's all come together to help save this beautiful landscape that God has given us before it is too late."
tt9253866,This series has been an absolute delight in every sense. Shows that we need to be mindful of how we live cos we humans aren't the only ones living on the planet.
tt9253866,"As we are reminded by an African proverb quoted in Terre des hommes (Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, 1939), 'we do not inherit the land from our parents, we borrow it from our children'. However, ecology and respect for nature always rhyme with procrastination. Indeed, since Neil Armstrong stepped on the lunar floor, the human population has more than doubled, but 60% of wildlife populations have disappeared.The series Our planet celebrates the naturals wonders that remain and invites us to be both contemplative and respectful. Thus, we cross every continent, we feel each season and we touch each of the 3 main elements (sea, air, earth). It's dazzlingly filmed. The voice of David Attenborough is warm and pleasant. The text is excellently written. What a delight!Although it can be sufficient in itself, this superb documentary may be supplemented by An Inconvenient Truth (2006), Microcosmos (1996), Oceans (2008), ..."
tt9253866,"It's good, but lacks the immersive scenes other planet earth type shows have had. For example, watch episode 7. It starts with a beautiful look at a large group of birds at Australia's biggest lake. And that's it. Just a camera in the middle of this chaos, and we're out. No predator vs prey relationship, nothing like penguins kidnapping other penguins offspring. Just a couple nice shots. No scenes stand out in ""Our Planet"" like the scene in planet earth two where baby iguanas hatch only to have to escape dozens of hungry snakes. In ""Our Planet"" there are some beautiful drone shots of a blue whale mother and her calf. But it's not as awe inspiring as ""Blue Planet"" documenting a blue whale feeding with shots from all angles and David narrating the play by play. It's a couple nice over head drone shots and we're done. Unlike the immersive feeding action of this giant. And I guess that's kind of how ""Our Planet"" feels and was shot, it's detached from the action. Many of the Hunt scenes in ""OurPlanet"" build tension only to end in a very boring stalemate with prey running and hunter not chasing (the tiger vs. the antelope). The jaguar vs caymen scene is obstructed by brush and the camera crew doesn't have a clean shot on the action. There's more interesting footage on YouTube of jaguar vs caymen. So again is ""Our Planet"" good? Hell yea it's good. Did I binge watch it over a couple days? Bet your ass I did. Are there cool scenes like cheetahs taking down an adult wildebeest? Probably. It's just a little over rated compared to its incredible predecessors."
tt9253866,"Do enjoy watching film and television on Netflix, but when it comes to the Netflix originals the odd gem crops up every now and again. But there are a fair share of films and television that don't do much or anything for me and those that start/started off very promisingly, in some cases brillantly, but decline badly, a major example being 'House of Cards'.Am however a massive fan of the national treasure that is David Attenborough, as is my sister, and when hearing that he had done a new series and it was on Netflix we just couldn't say no to watching it. The best of Attenborough's work, old and new, are genre landmarks and are incredible in their own right, his career has spanned decades and has been remarkably consistent. In that there is not a dud in the whole of his extensive filmography, his more flawed work still being decent, which is a rarity and something that has been deliberately reiterated by me many times. The 8 part 'Our Planet' was one of our most highly anticipated programmes, watching it we were utterly transfixed by the images, fascinated by all the animals and felt a wide gaumt of emotions. Whether biting our nails, shedding multiple tears, going awww at anything cute and even laughing. After watching 'Our Planet' we were shocked, inspired, very moved and in awe, not many programmes so far this year have made me feel like this. So far this year, this has been among the very best and very special, and in a completely different league when it comes to Netflix shows. Even if it isn't one of Attenborough's best or most ground-breaking.'Our Planet' is not about animals in beautiful environments being painted in a cute, reassuring and one-sided light, that was something that the brilliant 'Dynasties' was criticised for before it was even aired. Don't think either that it would offer nothing new. Some have criticised it for having an agenda and executing it heavy-handedly. The portrayal of the animals is far from reassuring, some are cute and some are quirky but much of the time the portrayal is complex and uncompromising, all without over-humanising them even in very human conflicts. The environments/habitats do look absolutely glorious (""Jungles"" being a prime example), make no mistake about that, but there is much more to them than that with them also being unforgiving and even fragile. ""Frozen Worlds"" especially.Regarding whether it offers anything new or not, the environments (jungles, the Arctic, deserts, grasslands etc.) and animals like penguins and killer whales are familiar. But there are also some rare animals not seen before (like in ""Jungles"" with the preening bird), familiar species doing uniquely different things like the caterpillars in ""From Deserts to Grasslands"" or the ants in ""Jungles"". It may seem on the outset that it's familiar, to me there was a different approach to the material, helped by the wide range of camera techniques where you see many animals up close in a way never seen before like with the Arabian Leopard and the cheetah it is very intimate.Did not find its heavy emphasis on conservation too preachy, unlike some. A lot of 'Our Planet' shows both the wonders of the planet, with all the different species and their behaviours (both familiar and unique) and the different habitats and the fragility of them as their environment is threatened and what human destruction does. What was said was important and things long needing to be addressed, with harrowing sequences like the endings of ""Our Planet"" and ""Frozen Worlds"", and with the predatory fungi, making one really sit up and think as well as feeling emotional and shell-shocked. Did find that the heavy emphasis on it was not a bad thing, considering that it applies to all the environments covered and many of the animals and such, such as the megafauna. It's not all doom and gloom, parts are hopeful.'Our Planet' does in all eight episodes look amazing. The scenery takes the breath away, especially in ""Jungles"" and ""Coastal Seas"", but it is more than just beautiful scenery. For example in ""Our Planet"" and ""Frozen Worlds"" one is reminded of how cruel that environment is. The scenery is complemented by photography of quite cinematic quality with a wider range of camera techniques rarely seen before, not just a feast for the eyes but it is also expansive and intimate in equal measure, enhancing the impact of the emotional and tense scenes of which in 'Our Planet' there are many. A big example being with the walruses in ""Frozen Worlds"", which really got me emotionally. The music is grand and atmospheric but also whimsical and jaunty. A memorable example being tango-inspired music in ""Jungles"" accompanying an amusing sequence.As one can expect, the narration is very thought-provoking and never rambling or speculative. There are some interesting individual feeling stories here throughout and so many of the species are easy to relate to. A lot of information is covered but felt properly explored and not rushed or disjointed, and the facts educate and illuminate while not being compromised for the emotionally complex storytelling. Once again, Attenborough's distinctive and unequalled narrative delivery, with his unmistakable voice, is sincere, enthusiastic as well as understated. One can listen to him for a long time and not tire of him, no other nature/wildlife documentary narrator/presenter has made me feel this way.In conclusion, count me in as another person who finds 'Our Planet' brilliant. 10/10"
tt9253866,"This is by far the most amazing piece of art ever made! Sir David Attenborough is as always absolutely amazing, narrating with all his passion and love for the nature. But This documentary is different then anything else I ever saw (and I saw almost everything available), because it's explaining and connecting the pictures to the current situation of our planet. Absolutely amazing"
tt9253866,"I've never seen nature shot so close-up and beautifully. The visually alone are mind-boggling, you feel like you're right there. Pair that with David Attenborough's legendary narration and this is a surefire masterpiece."
tt9253866,"This series looks fantastic on my 10-year old Samsung LCD TV. I can only imagine what it looks like on some of the new 4K+ televisions!I'm blown away by the visuals, especially how they got footage of stalking tigers in the tall grass, and from 1000 meters below the sea, or how they got into the hollow tunnels of an ant colony. How the people who get into some of these tight spots simply amazes me! I said ""Wow!"" a number of times throughout the series!But there is one really important message (over-emphasized in this series in my humble opinion) about planet protection I could have done without but I gave the series a 10 rating anyway because of the visuals. We know the planet is in danger, and many animal species will perish if we continue the way we are headed, but it's good to hear that some animals that were near extinction are now thriving and coming back after many decades.David Attenborough and Netflix are a marriage made in Heaven."
tt9253866,"Absolutely stunning visuals and sound, an absolute delight for the senses"
tt9253866,"Upon viewing the premier yesterday evening, being only the first episode, what I appreciated the most was the quality of the footage. It really brought the show to life, almost feeling like I was really there in various environments around the planet. Everything appeared so beautiful and natural, but with nature there were obviously sad moments too.The first episode felt like an introduction to the rest of the series and I am very much looking forward to watching the remaining episodes, once they become available on Netflix later today, where I expect the true threats to the various fragile environments which form our planet will be explained.Before the premier we were treated to clips of the crews filming at various locations, from wading waste deep through mosquito infested swaps in a rainforest to living in huts for weeks to try and capture a glimpse of a Siberian tiger. The harsh environments they endure for weeks or months at a time, sometimes to obtain footage lasting just a few seconds, or none at all, is inspiring in itself.Sir David is a true inspiration for past, present and future generations. They way he construes information to the viewers is warm and simple, yet all the messages he wants to deliver are received very well."
tt9253866,"Each new epic nature series brings something new. With each development in the science and art of photography we are treated to new wonderful scenes.David Attenborough has for a long time brought brilliant series such as Planet Earth I and II, Blue Planet etc to life with his unique, passionate and wonderful voice. Along with Cousteau he contributed to my path of becoming a marine biologist.This series, as the others were, is sorely and unfortunately needed. Hopefully Netflix and Attenborough can reach a new, more motivated audience, with this fantastic show to inspire not only wonder but also action."
tt9253866,David Attenborough is back with another set of vivid nature videos that transports us to the world of animals and their day to day struggle to adapt to changing conditions. This is highly recommended not just for Nature Lovers but for all others as well because we get to appreciate how delicate nature is and the impact we are having on them.
tt9253866,"Our Planet was an interesting documentary with extraordinary visuals and some great music, but it gets pretty one tonal after a few episodes. The only thing that changes each episode is the climate in which the animals live, otherwise it's just hunter-prey, eat or be eaten. The part about Chernobyl was very interesting and I would have wanted to have seen more of that but then the season was over and I had watched all episodes. Still, overall it is a very good season and it delves deep into the problems facing our planet, our species and our animals. David Attenborough is phenomenal as always and the score by Steven Price is also amazing."
tt9253866,"One could never criticize a BBC planet earth documentary. The images and views are spectacular.But the movie intrumental score, soundtrack or whatever to call it; Is getting on my nerves!
Its too loud and takes away from the documetary experience.
First of all, its underwhelming. Its boringly composed music.
Also its Overwhelming. They put on this music to enhance our feeling. But its just disturbing the harmony. Whenever its an action scene, or a critical scene, or whenever its an ""exciting scene"" they have this stupid background music. Just be silent and let me enjoy the sceneries without bad music pounding in the background giving me headache.I wan't a nature experience. I don't need this much music interfering on the background!"
tt9253866,"It's not an interesting series about nature, it's a cry for help. Here you will be constantly reminded that ""everything is dying"", ""it was better ten years ago"", ""after ten years there will be no animals left"", ""people are killing planet"" and so on and so on. EVERY 10 minutes D. Attenborough brags about ""overfishing"", ""icecap melting"", ""deforestation"" and stuff like that. If you're not some nature fan who fights for nature in daily basis, ""Our planet"" is just not for you. It's mood killer and I do not recommend it. It's nothing like ""Blue planet"" or ""Planet Earth""."
tt2560140,"Attack On Titan is officially over. And nothing will ever be the same.When I finished Breaking Bad back in 2019 prior to ever watching anime, if someone told me an anime would be on the same playing field as Breaking Bad and even exceed it at times, I would've told them they were crazy. But in reality, I was the crazy one. This story took me places mentally and emotionally I didn't think I could go.In this dark and cruel world created by Hajime Isayama, while some things are objectively wrong, there's never a moment where you can definitively say that someone's the good guy or bad guy. Once you see the full picture of the show, it's indescribable to explain the show in the manner of good and bad considering how much everyone's in this dark abyss of a gray area that has no objective answer to whom is in the right or wrong. And that's the beauty of AOT.Attack On Titan is not meant to be joyous. It's a tragedy. It's an unfair world where everyone at some point is given a dirty hand whether they deserve it or not, and the characters have to try and live with that reality and keep moving forward. Now that doesn't mean that there aren't moments where you as a viewer can feel joyous for your perspective favorite character/side because there likely will be, but when you're no longer told the story through this small microscope, you won't be able to see the show the same.And that's where the absurd genius of the creator Hajime Isayama comes into play. As much as I love the Vince Gilligan's of the world, David Chase, Peter Gould, Jesse Armstrong, David Simon and honestly any writer of any piece of fiction... no one comes close to the creativity that this man has. Isayama is able to create this large world in these small walls surrounded by humanoid creatures that live to destroy and ruin the human race. But as you continue to watch the show, it's like you're peeling an endless onion that doesn't stop, and constantly makes your eyes water and tear up due to the brutality and the absurdity that this universe subjects you to. It will boggle your mind then tear you to shreds in ways that I've never seen before.The plot twists are second to none. The heartbreak will shatter you to pieces. The betrayals will leave you speechless. The world building will make everything before seem small. And the clashes of different ideals will leave you wondering how you could even pick a side. I could go on all day but to put it simply, the unique story in itself is what brings this all together. And that's not even mentioning things like the voice acting, music, animation, esc. Which are all top tier.This isn't an anime. This isn't a TV show. This is a fictional masterpiece. And I'm honored and blessed to say that I got to live to see the day where I'd witness the end of it. Thank you, Hajime Isayama. And see you later, AOT."
tt2560140,"The moment you watch this audiovisual masterpiece you will immediately appreciate the level of thought and detail that went into this. From the initial scene that shows you the main and unique weapons to some of the frames that could literally be used as your desktop background or be hanged in your room as paintings. From episode to episode you'll think that you won't be surprised anymore and you'll be wrong again and again, every time I thought an episode or season couldn't be better I was proven wrong. You will get goos bumps from dialog alone and you will lose your mind in the epic fight scenes The characters and their development, the story covered in mystery that unveils beautifully, a dialog carefully written that shows the characters personalities and wisdom., sound design, music, illumination... you'll feel like you are there. The voicing of the characters is excellent... there is nothing below excellent in this. An absolute masterpiece and a bar of quality for any audio visual product to come. Be prepared to care only about Attack on Titan and nothing else, because nothing else will make you feel this way."
tt2560140,"Before I started watching this show, I couldn't imagine why it is rated so high. After I finished the first season, I understood. And now, having watched the third season I don't understand, why it isn't rated even higher!Truly a masterpiece, and deserves to be mentioned on the same page as other fantasy war epics like Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones. (I dare to say this is even better than those two.) There are countless twist and turns, shocking revelations and heartbreaking moments troughout the series, spiced with great voice acting, beautiful visuals and on top of all: a more than perfect, stunning soundtrack, thanks to Hiroyuki Sawano.The story is brilliantly written, and does not slow down, not even for a bit. It keeps growing bigger and bigger, while you will find yourself tied to your chair, as you can't watch only one or two episodes. Behind the plot and the action, there is also deeper meaning about war, humanity and questions about moral dilemmas.Toughtprovoking, exciting and most of all a masterpiece of our time!"
tt2560140,"Growing up in the 80's 90's during the time of top anime stories and always getting into arguments with my friends and my son that those were the golden anime era and now I have to admit. This is if not the best story telling I witness in all my years. This show raise the bars with each episode, with unpredictable twist and turns you won't see coming. After completing season 4 mid season finally I must say I'm happy to be alive witnessing a master peace in the making. Can't wait for the finally!"
tt2560140,"I'm a more frequent American TV shows watcher than Anime watcher. I have been watching multiple great TV shows in the past 10 years: Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Lost, Westworld, The Boys, Dark, House of Cards, Sherlock etc. - just to name a few. Attack on Titan caught my attention one day after I checked the top 250 TV shows on IMDB and saw multiple 10/10 featured reviews from other people, especially considering that it's an anime that is ranked very high on the list.Hence, I came to AoT with high expectation and after watching it, I'm surprised that it only gets a 9/10. This show is definitely not inferior to Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad, though I understand that being an animated, foreign show means that it has to try much harder to prove its worth.I find AoT to be almost perfect, and I don't think it's realistic to expect any shows to be perfect. After all, these pieces of arts are all created by human being and we are imperfect! What other reviewers said about AoT is absolutely true: AoT has incredible storytelling, world building, plot twist, foreshadowing, character development and excellent soundtracks. On top of that, I trust the hype also comes from the fact that this show builds such a strongly immersive world for viewers where one can feel being part of its world and understanding the characters' motives and actions. This exerts a strong impact on our feelings and the theme itself is so thought-provoking, which is not something a lot of shows could do. And trust me, I believe I watched enough good series and movies so as not to be easily impressed. On a side note, I don't find the lowest ratings for AoT justified, but rather superficial. Among the lowest reviews I've seen so far on IMDB, none has truly given a critical analysis of why the show is objectively bad - it's either coming from pure haters, those who are too impatient to watch the story in full or those who just don't want to understand the series because of existing bias. Also, any comments saying that AoT is predictable and cliché is the same as saying GoT is predictable too 😊.The show keeps getting better and better after each season with lots of jaw-dropping twists. As such, I do respect its consistently high quality after 10 years since its first episode and after seeing multiple great TV series starting off well and had degrading quality after a few seasons. There is only 1 episode left and the show so far has only raised the bar after each episode. I know about the ending through the manga and I find it absolutely satisfying. It's considered to be a controversial ending where the fandom is splitted. But I think that's the beauty of this series - it's more real than a live-action show and it correctly depicts the actual world. There is no boundary of good or bad, right or wrong - it's all about perspective.All in all, a phenomenal journey that I'm utterly grateful to embark on. An absolute 10/10 for this masterpiece - a pity that 10 is all there is to rate."
tt2560140,"I'm not an expert of anime. I haven't even read the manga, which I'll do it btw. But I can assure you that attack on titan will keep you interested from the very beginning thanks to a gripping and original plot. There isn't a single boring episode, it's always suspance and action. It may seem a superficial fantasy anime but it actually deals with important topics, such as freedom. Furthermore, the soundtracks are so good that you will start feeling patriotism for an imaginary country."
tt2560140,"Review By Kamal KStory 10/10It continunes few days after where we left off last season and it focuses more on political drama and dilemmas inside the walls. This season gets straight to the point and introduces new villain named Kenny that turns out to be somehow related to Levi. There are many parties trying to get Eren and Historia. For what reason? It is yet to be reveald. Mystery we all feel in love with is still there and there are even more questions, but don't let that distract you from the fact that this season ,even tho is only few episodes in, already has some major reveals in it. Pacing is amazing and i wasn't bored for a moment while watching. Things are only getting more interesting when Erwin reveals how he's planning to ovethrow the governmant without using the force. This season has a very refreshing and different plot compared to previous ones as we can see from the lack of titans and focuse on the issues inside the walls rather than beyond. However it's still as, if not more interesting than before. There is world buidling,mystery,back stabbing and some major questions answered which there is hopfully more to come.Animation 10/10As we can see characters in this season look a little bit different or older which some might not like but i do personally. It's a fresh change. They look closer to their manga designes. Some might notice that they removed those thick black lines around characters faces which made AOT art stand out even more. Don't get me wrong, it still does but that was something that was missing which kept me from giving it 10/10.
Animation is brilliant for this season (it's Attack on Titan after all :D) and like every season it only got better. . Perfect combination between 3D background and 2D animation along with masterfull camera movement made this scene look like a movie. There is even one frame where levi is facing the wall and you can see his reflection in the window. Just goes to show how much detail and time was put in to this scene. After i done some research i found out that it took the animator of this scene 1 whole month to complete it. Just that one scene alone. All props to Arifumi Imai. Great job. Hopfully it keeps this quality because this season is said to be 24 episodes long.Sound 10/10I mean, is there anything to say? AoT is notorious for it's amazing OST and sound quality. Voice actors are great as always and the sound that stand out to me the most was the sound of falling shell from kenny on the roof in ep.1. It was just so satisfying :D. And again mad props to Hiroyuki Sawano (the composer) for the epic and emotional music.Characters 10/10What i like about AoT characters is the fact that they interact so naturally and nothing from their conversation seems forced which is immediately showcased in the very first scene in ep. 1. That cabin scene where jean and eren argue,sasha tries to steal bread, mikasa still does work even tho she's injured and armin cares for her deeply. And of course Levi the clean freak comes in at the end :p They are such fun and lively characters.
This season already had some major development for our cast. We got to see Erwin's and Hisotira's backstories which also delved deeper in their characters motives. Both backstories were heartbreaking and made me care a lot more for them. Hisotira is slowly taking of her ""Christa Lenz"" facade (is that how you say it? lol) and Erwin is proving again and again why everyone loves him and would follow him to death. His childhood story is very similar to how our society and governmant wokrs today which is very scary. And we all need to remember that isayama is criticizing this type of government and society with these topics. Instead of just walking of Erwin comes back to Dimo Rivees's wife and comforts her saying he'll avange him. Erwin is charismatic,great leader, intellignet and someone that you just want to follow. Since the young age he was corious and as he call himself a ""gambler"". He is someone that would give everything for the humanity. Or is he? I think there is a lot more to his character. Hange got some development too. Eren is maturing and seems a lot more chill this season but unfortunately he is kiddnaped again :( Poor guy he just can't catch a break. In ep.1 he helps historia to overcome here pain and shows again just how honest he is by telling her ""I like you more this way, just a stupidly normal honest girl"". Also hugeee development for armin. To think that he would be capable of killing a human.. this will deffinitely have a huge impact on his character in the future. The way he selfreflects and his philosohpical speach about morals is great, it really makes you think. He kinda has a point too. He shows one more time how mentally strong he is even tho he lacks physicial strength. This time is just on another level. Now lets talk about our new villain. KENYYYYYYYYYYY. I love this guy lol. The way he roasts and insults levi and the cowboy vibe he gives. I love it. He immediately showcases that he is not a joke by blowing nifa's head off just like that. He also seems very mysterious. The way he treats levi is almost as if he looks down upon him. Speaking of Levi here is what i think: That chase scene where he's running away from kenny is not just a great action sequence it also represents Levi running from his past. Kenny=His past. Running from kenny or his past. This arc is also big development and challange for him now that he has to act as a leader/commander because erwin is absent or busy. There was also some smaller developments for connie (motivating himself to take on the beast titan),jean (struggling to remain human which almost costs him life, also selfreflecting), sanes (showing how he didn't want to do the things that he has done and over the time he just got used to it, also he was kinda easy to symphatise with too and his devotion to king is may be morally wrong but aslo admirable, the way he feels destroyed after finding out that he was actually the one that betrayed the king is also worth mentioning), flegel (stepping up becoming a boss saying how he'll protect the people of his city), zachary (showcasing that he cares more about himself rather than humanity and how he always hated the governmant because they looked up on everyone).Enjoyment 10/10I never enjoyed AoT more. It's great.This season has perfect balance between story telling, character development and action.Overall 10/10"
tt2560140,"Incredible, I honestly have to say that this could be the best anime ever due to its development and plot. Shingeki No Kyojin has one of the best character developments and plot in history (note that this series does not have fill), he even the secondary and third characters have a great importance in the story, but also has that sense of terror, action and drama that by the way is incredibly well done, makes you live the situation that the characters go through and transmit their emotions to you in a very human way. It has an excellent background story that is simply memorable.Every decision they make is of minor importance to the series and should not be missed, their deaths and the surprise of knowing who are the real antagonists add a magical touchThe first season has a slight start, it ends up being a spectacular season, it is not the best but it is an amazing season with an incredible animation and plot, here you will be introduced to the first antagonist of the series. 9.4/10The second season I think was epic, this is when you start to see the faces of the real villains (get ready for Senshi Tmp 2 Ep 6 which according to me is the best of the second season, an overwhelming chapter) Shingeki no Kyojin explains it to you perfectly without leaving gaps in the plot, an incredible season. 9.6/10The third season is truly phenomenal, has a good start and lets you know the problems you will have in a society by not agreeing with something or the difficult decisions you must make to ensure your survival. After this, too many things are clarified without detours, the chapters that stood out most were Perfect Game (Tmp 3, Ep 16), Hero (Tmp 3, Ep 17), Midnight Sun (Tmp 3, Ep 18) and That Day (Tmp 3, Ep 20) (That day has no action or features our main characters, but this chapter amazes me, its development is spectacular and the way they explain everything is overwhelming, honestly, the best development chapter in the history of anime). 9.8/10Season four is the start of the finale. A season practically perfect, in this season everything comes to light answering every question of the viewer, leaves no gaps in the plot and has a beautiful animation, besides that is incredibly shocking and demonstrates the incredible development in our protagonists, Eren has the best character development I think. For me the best chapters were in my opinion Declaration of War (Tmp 4, Ep 5) (Declaration of War is one of the most impactful chapters of development), The War Hammer Titan (Tmp 4, Ep 6), Assault (Tmp 4, Ep 7), Assassin's Bullet (Tmp 4, Ep 7) (Assassin's Bullet left me speechless...) and Above and Below (Tmp 4, Ep 16), has not yet finished this season, but still for me it is spectacular. 9.9/ 10 This season is the best.In my opinion your average would be 9.3/10. Sincerely from my point of view, the best anime ever, a work of art from post-apocalyptic fiction."
tt2560140,"This anime is simply amazing! The way it is animated, the soundtrack, the characters, the story, the thrill and the suspense. All in one action-packed anime. One of the best so far. As it has only 9 episodes as of now ... many critics say that it is way too early to rate an anime. But, according to me, this is pure class. The soundtrack's tempo varies according to the situation and this makes it more exciting. The ending of the episode is something that NO one will look forward to as NO one will want it to end. A must watch for every anime lover and of course the manga is available as well. Although a bit gory, the epicness makes up for it! You know those animes that catch your eye from the first episode, this is one of them."
tt2560140,"Perfect from every prospective story,music, sound track, art and animation. This is not an ordinary anime it's a masterpiece."
tt2560140,"Season 1: 7/10This is probably the best the show ever was, despite all the anime-isms that make parts of it hard to take seriously. It's exciting, it's mysterious, and it does a fantastic job of setting the tone.Season 2: 6/10This season is fine, it strays from the first season's tone a bit more than I'd like and it's full of conversations between major characters that the audience has zero context for, making this is a frustrating season to watch. On top of that, what should've been one of the show's biggest reveals is extremely downplayed to the detriment of the season.Season 3: 5/10I'm very mixed about this season. It's divided into two distinct arcs, the first of which is awful and the second of which is nearly the same level of quality as the first season. The structure and pacing of the first arc is terrible, the villains are bland and either not fleshed out at all or too late for the audience to care. The second arc of this season, however, is exciting and much more important to the overall narrative of the show. It still fails to perfectly recapture the tone of season one, but it's very good. The first arc is a 3/10 and the second if a 7/10, so rating-wise I took the average.Season 4: 6/10This season was difficult to get through for me, not because it was bad but because it was so different, There was so much information, and there were so many new characters and conflicts. It was a lot, but I think in the end it mostly worked. Not every new character or plot thread mattered in the grand scheme of things, while others mattered a lot and significantly impacted the narrative. The animation style was also very different this season and unfortunately it was to the show's detriment.Overall, I like this show a lot, but it has some significant problems. My biggest complaint was that the tone was set perfectly in season one, then largely abandoned for the rest of the series. Despite this, the show is exciting, the music and animation is (mostly) great, and the characters are well-realized and fun to watch."
tt2560140,"So good, I'm waiting the next season , and also a very good SGI and what a wonderful story , I don't know how to i'm gonna wait until next season"
tt2560140,"A lot of people have this question, can season 4 beat season 3 part 2? And the answer is yes! Isn't full of action, is like a combination of all the seasons, great plot, the best charachter development in all the serie, great action, and a lot of plot twist. October 2020, please I need you right now!"
tt2560140,Attack On Titan makes it hard for me to enjoy watching other Animes 😂
tt2560140,"Ive been watching this show since 2016, and I wanted to write a review for it but I couldn't because with every new episode i have a mixed feelings and i can't determine where am i from this show. But now, with only 1 episode left, i can finally write whats in my heart.In AOT, you dont have to support the ""good"" against the ""evil"", because simply there's no such thing in this world. Usually, an any work whether if its a movie, tv show or an anime, there's sides and you as a viewer have the choice to support whatever you like good or bad. Most people choose the good side, some choose the bad one. This type of work represents almost 75% of all the works out there. So some of us have adjusted to the idea of good and bad sides.The other 25% are shows, movies and animes like AOT, they are psychologically complexed with a lot of twists and most importantly no good or bad sides. These kind of animes describes the world and our reality in such a scary truthful way, it mixes your emotions and feelings and you dont know what to think, makes you consider a thousand time before calling a character good or bad, this is AOT.After completing most of the show i can say, that AOT reached a high level of realism. That you dont have to determine in which side are you.One advice for anyone who hasn't saw AOT or is still in the beginning, dont take sides, just enjoy the anime because I believe its the best anime in the world."
tt2560140,"Some of the people have rated this show a 1 out of 10. And I understand why. The Plot is so well written, you won't even know the real storyline until season 3 or whatever. On the outside it seems a pretty simple story. Demons vs humans. Who will win? That is hardly the story at all... and even thinking that, I watched through the first 2 seasons. And even then I was hooked because of great story building and great great climaxes and actions and all. I thought season 1 ending was insane. Then season 2 came. I thought It was even crazier. Then season 3! A literal masterpiece... specially the second arc. and the 4th season is expected to be God Level. And I expect nothing less from the greatest anime of all time. That's how good the story is! It's complex yes. Greatest Plot I have ever seen on a show. I love breaking bad, I love Avatar the last air-bender, I love Game of thrones. But The story line, music, and the voice acting are all 10/10 easily. Do yourself a favor, don't judge it by it's cover, get through some quality anime till you reach God level story telling. You will thank me when you reach the season 3 finale, GUARANTEED!"
tt2560140,"Attack on Titan is the king of world building and plot. With ultra realistic consequences missing from a lot of animation, Attack on Titan stands out as it has an incredibly dark world with actually stakes. The aspects of horror and adrenaline when there's an action scene is stellar. The characters, action and music could carry episodes but don't have to because the show is already that good. Characters have depth and feel like real people, they die constantly and never feel 100% safe. The action is some of the best action in any show. Mystery aspects make even moments that could come off as bland feel so much more impactful. This is perhaps one of the best stories ever written. The Music makes this epic world feel vast and important, while also sounding phenomenal. Attack on Titan is a masterpiece of our generation and my favorite TV Show of all time."
tt2560140,"This series is really ahead of its time, its brilliant and its definitely the best tv show ive ever watched in my life. The fact that it has an imdb of 8.8 is a disgrace, it deserves way better than that especially after the glorious season 3 part 2. This anime is way better than rick and morty, way better than even game of thrones, but the ppl in charge of imdb give it a way lower ratings than those two?......balls. This anime deserves a lot more respect."
tt2560140,"I am not the regular anime fan, I've seen some really good ones but Attack on Titan sits on a whole other level of amazing writing.The way the story unfolds is so well written and engaging, that I was hooked since the first season where the plot seemed to be a very basic revenge story between humans stuck living inside mysterious walls and their nemesis, humanoid titans which seems to exist with the sole purpose of eating humans alive.It's hard to make a detailed review without giving up on spoilers, I've shared the premises, but Attack on Titan is so much more than that... From the parallelisms with the real world depicting themes like war, greed, complacency, the inherit curiosity for exploration all the way to the grey characters and their respective development, I can only say good things about this anime.Ambiguity is an ever present concept in our lives, and this show depicts it like very few do, this associated with how brilliant the characters evolve throughout all 4 seasons its remarkable, you can empathize with someone that made the most awful things and that shows how brilliant the creator is.Adding to all the above, you will be facing many mind blowing twists and unexpected dark turns on the story, with one of the best animation work I've ever seen on screen, specially the most recent episodes - considering this started almost 10 years ago!Outstanding soundtrack, I get the chills on many of the fight scenes and of course it goes without saying that the fights themselves are brilliant, nerve wracking and make you so hyped with all of the elements of the action combined, really a one of a kind TV show.I am eagerly waiting for the final part next year I don't know if it wraps up badly but up until this point it's a flawless masterpiece and I don't say that lightly.EDIT AFTER SERIES FINALE:
It's quite the challenge to say the least to end a series like this one, after having watched the final episode I can safely reinforce how much of a masterpiece this anime is.... The message in the end transcends entertainment, it's a timeless lesson and it is scary how close to reality it is. It's almost impossible to get into detail without writing a full script so I'll leave it at this; this is one of the best TV shows ever created, don't take my word for it go binge it now that it wrapped up!"
tt2560140,"Season 4 is halfway through already, and I have gone back once again to re-watch the previous seasons, and it truly is a masterpiece on all levels. I had to pause S1E06 just now to write this review as 9 minutes into that episode had me crying again.I have been watching AoT since 2013, eagerly awaiting each new episode and season, and it's hard to believe the series is ending very soon. ""Don't be sad that it's over, be happy that it happened"", and all that...For a time my top 3 running shows were GoT, Vikings, and AoT. Sadly, GoT collapsed before the finish line, Vikings slowly fizzled out in quality after its fourth season, yet Attack on Titan has held strong and not only remained brilliant, but actually improved in many ways as the show progressed, which is incredibly rare.I still to this day listen to the amazing soundtrack while doing other things, and each time I return to watching the show, it's hard to pinpoint anything bad about it really. And I know some people will say that AoT is overrated, and I might have thought that at some points in the show also, such as at various points in Season 2 and 3, but when you see how it all connects together and makes overall sense in the macro, some seemingly weaker aspects or things that appear nonsensical, overly contrived or dramatized at the time, make sense upon revisiting it, or at least that was my experience.Anyway, I would give Attack on Titan a 10/10 simply because it is so intensely watchable, engaging, inspiring, epic, thought-provoking, anti-war, spine-chilling, horrifying at times, emotional and tear-inducing.If you liked the early seasons of Game of Thrones, Vikings, Breaking Bad, Fullmetal Alchemist, and other similar shows, then Attack on Titan is indeed for you.Now to slowly endure the agonising anticipation for each new and final episode of the last season...P.S. - a good companion documentary to this is Dominion (2018)"
tt2560140,"A well made anime. The feel this show gives is just awesome. I always want more of it and one episode a week is just so not fair. Right now I am on 20th episode and it's really getting better.The show hooked me from the very first episode. How action and emotions connects and make a perfect atmosphere for Titans, monsters who like to eat humans just for fun, and humans, fighting for their existence when stuck inside three walls.How main characters who aren't super powerful yet give a promising touch to the show. And how they show a real management work even when their is anger, fear and blood in the air.Characters are super cool and feel real unlike regular animes. This show is a guarantee of entertainment. Give it a try."
tt2560140,This anime just keeps me on the edge of my seat. Each week I watch and each week I want more. It's intense. The concept and story line are on point and keep you thrilled and wanting more. The only downside is the seven-day waiting for the next episode. Definitely one of the best anime I have seen. I often watch anime for fun and as a means of passing the time away but with this it's different. I can't tear my eyes away for even a second. A masterpiece in the making. I just hope the producers keep this running for longer instead of cutting it short into a 20-something episode thing such as SAO or BTOOOM!.Do yourself a favor and follow it.
tt2560140,"Now that it's nearing it's part 1 ending, i'm so not okay. Binge-watched the whole show in a week or two and it's absolutely phenomenal. To be honest, i haven't even read a single chapter of AOT (Manga). And yet i've become a huge fan of this show. I'm waiting for part 1 to end (although i never wish it to end), so that i can read it completely all 33 Volumes. I could've read it before watching the anime but i hesitated. Because i wanted to know what it'd be like to watch this without reading the Manga.It's incredible how they managed to make it so special. This show is one of the greatest i have seen. I have watched almost 30 tv shows including Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones in the last couple of years. They were both an amazing show, had huge impact on viewers and general audiences. At the time, for me, GOT was the best of the best. But when i watched this, i'm kinda gradually giving it to AOT. Because it's perfect, every season and almost every episodes.Although i got a glimpse of what is to come in the next episode. But i didn't read it completely. Still waiting to read. Anyway, i can't wait for the next one, ""Savagery"" to come out. It's going to be beyond epic. I'm quite sure. I'd have rather rated this more than 10 if it was possible.(Season I : 9.3) (Season II : 9.7)(Season III : 9.8) (Season IV : 9.8)Musical Score : 100/100Characters : 105/100Animation : 99/100Story : 110/100."
tt1475582,Sherlock is just an incredible series. It has a 9.1 rating for a reason. There have been so many shows and movies based off Sherlock Holmes but I can say with confidence that this is the best of them. The writing and acting is would makes this show so special. Every single season is just as good as the others. Benedict Cumberbatch was born to play this role...he is Sherlock Holmes. Martin Freeman also stars as Dr. John Watson and those two lead just an overall great cast. This show won so many awards including 9 Emmys over the course of its run. If you haven't seen this incredible series yet then do yourself a favor and go watch it as soon as possible!
tt1475582,"..with delight. A brilliantly written, well acted programme. Well done to all concerned. The story had me hooked from the start.All the elements of Holmes are present and correct. So far most of the original characters have appeared, with hints of more yet to appear. It is suspenseful and sometimes genuinely funny. I have read all the original stories, and after the late, great Jeremy Brett, despaired of ever seeing another top notch Holmes film. This is it, Brought up to date into the 21st century, but done with affection and respect to the original. Nice to see the writers have continued the theme of an intelligent (slightly bemused) Watson. CAN WE HAVE A FULL SERIES PLEASE. If not this is one I will return to again and again."
tt1475582,"To my surprise they absolutely nailed it. Cumberbatch is a fantastic choice for Sherlock Holmes-he is physically right (he fits the traditional reading of the character) and he is a damn good actor. Martin Freeman, about whom I wasn't sure at first, is an excellent foil for Holmes without being the dumb sidekick that Dr Watson has often been. I thought that this series would not work, particularly after Robert Downey's interesting take on Conan Doyle's characterisation. I have been proved so wrong-it moved along at a good pace and held the attention brilliantly. My wife started by saying she didn't like it but by the end of the episode she was as enthralled as I. We are both looking forward to the rest of the series, if it is as entertaining as the first story. I was disappointed to read some reviews here that did not love it. Methinks they are too jaded to enjoy anything."
tt1475582,"It's after 2am and I have just registered on IMDb after watching the first ep of Sherlock as I was compelled to get it out there that this show presents some PURE BRILLIANCE in its delivery of my favourite fictional detective. Hard to believe they could create a setting in modern times where the illustrious Holmes and Watson set off on their adventures and absolutely GET IT RIGHT, in every aspect. Sir Arthur would, I believe, approve of this adaptation and be pleased that yet another generation is able to live the thrill of the chase, the connection of obscure yet obvious (to a genius) clues... the little things that have a far greater relevance than you would normally perceive. For a first episode... BUGGER ME, I am more than hooked and now await more installments and hope that each episode is as brilliant as the last... I have a feeling it will continue from strength to strength as we delve deeper into the darkness that is the mind of Sherlock Holmes. if they had an 11 out of 10 rating... that's my vote. The game is definitely on my dear Watson!"
tt1475582,"Sherlock is such an absolutely brilliant show! All you have to do is read through some of the reviews to see how loved this show really is. It's one of the best rated tv shows on just about every website for a reason...because it's incredible! There have been a lot of different versions of Sherlock Holmes with a bunch of really good ones (Robert Downey Jr., Jonny Lee Miller) and with some really bad ones but Benedict Cumberbatch is the best of them!"
tt1475582,"I have been an avid fan of Sherlock Holmes from a very young age, and my first reaction upon hearing of a modern TV remake was ""oh bugger, they are so going to screw this up"". However, i am glad to report that, unlike so many other TV adaptations and especially ones that modernise, i found it witty, clever and above all, entertaining. It was extremely reverential of its considerable pedigree and included a large number of coded references and callbacks for the more avid fan, e.g. the use of scratches around a persons mobile phone charger port to indicate a drunkard rather than a pocket watches winding keyhole. I imagine many were irked by this and as i can see from the ratings many did not care for it at all, but for me it was simply sublime, and well deserving of a 10 out of 10"
tt1475582,"I think it is always a bit uncertain and tricky when a 19th century series or film is modernised and most of the time it doesn't work, especially if it is well known and liked but I was very very impressed. Benedict does a brilliant job portraying the famous sleuth and made a 19th century character and modern day London merge beautifully. Martin Freeman was also great as Dr Watson. Rupert Graves made a brilliant Lestrade. It was sharp, quick and kept you on your toes and you just couldn't wait to see what happened next, this was of course completed by brilliant acting from the actors. I'm so pleased it got favourable reviews from the critics, roll on the next episode!!!!"
tt1475582,"Another film adaptation of the stories about the most famous detective in the world. This time, the creators decided to experiment and transfer Sherlock's actions to our time - and they succeeded.Benedict played Sherlock brilliantly, his version is really memorable because of his incredible charisma. Besides him, of course, it should be noted the other characters, from John Watson, played by Martin Freeman, to the gorgeous Moriarty played by Andrew Scott.In addition to experimenting with time, the creators were not afraid to take risks and deviate from the canon, which made the series a newer and very interesting story, you can only praise them.Many people do not have the most unambiguous opinion about season 3 and even season 4, they believe that after the first 2 seasons the bar of the series fell, while I think not at all. There are especially no complaints about season 4, many were confused by the main antagonist, but this is canon, so I'm sorry. And of course I liked the creators' departure from the comedy with a detective story to a more serious story, it added color to ""Sherlock"".As a result, this is just a wonderful work that has been kept at the same level for all 4 seasons, which is a separate respect for the directors and screenwriters.My rating - 8/10 (Worthy of viewing)"
tt1475582,"I've been a Sherlock Holmes' fan for what feels like forever, and, like others, was concerned that this modern version would be a disaster. I needn't have worried. It was a terrific, fast-paced, edge-of-the-seat adventure. Benedict Cumberbatch (what a name!) brings a dark edginess to Holmes that gives the whole piece a delightful 'gothic' feel, while Martin Freeman - if the first episode is anything to go by - will make a perfect foil as Watson. Casting is so important and this combination feels just right.I'll always have a soft spot for Basil Rathbone's Holmes, and, on the small screen at least, I can't see anyone displacing Jeremy Brett as the definitive 'Victorian' sleuth. But maybe, just maybe, the writers have created a Sherlock for the modern age who will stand the test of time and join a handful of other portrayals in the Pantheon of the greats.Moffat's pedigree as a comedy writer has added a new layer to the Holmes' scenario, and though there were several in-jokes in the first episode that only Holmes' aficionados would appreciate, there was enough general humour to lighten what might otherwise have been a dark canvas.Of course, I shouldn't have had any doubts. Steven Moffat is, after all, the man who rescued Dr Who from the self-indulgent, soap-opera obsessed, poorly scripted, moribund years of Russell T Davies and turned it back into a fun-packed joy to watch. He's done the same with 'Sherlock'. The man is a genius. I can't wait for the next instalment."
tt1475582,"When someone pointed me to Sherlock- a new series on BBC I was, to say the least, a bit skeptical. On top of that, I was told that this Sherlock lived in London in 2010 and was fond of texting on his Blackberry and hosted a website? Color me confused! But I gave it a looksie –after all how bad could it be- Holmes is Holmes. On screen appears a lanky young fellow in a trench coat, getting high on nicotine patches who I am supposed to believe is Sherlock Holmes? This was, as far from my favorite pipe smoking, deer hunting cap wearing image of Holmes, as it could be. I rolled my eyes-this is going to be cheesy. But then in one swift sequence "" the lanky young Holmes"" in his first meeting with John Watson describes him, his profession , his relationship with his brother and his brother's marital status-all by one look at his cell phone (that's right his cell phone). BANG! I was hooked. This is Sherlock Holmes through and through.And that in essence is why Sherlock is so, so good. Holmes is not about the Victorian costumes and the environment in which the mysteries unfold. It's about the characters and the events that make the stories the defining mystery novels of so many generations. And Steven Moffat & Mark Gatiss' take on Conan Doyle's master detective captures the essence of Sherlock Holmes magnificently. The stories are essentially the same (the first episode-A Study in Pink is a take on A Study in Scarlet-the first Holmes novel) but given a contemporary twist. This contemporary take (which I thought was going to be cheesy initially) is what shows the duo's exemplary creativity. The modern outlook does not take away anything from the essence of Sherlock Holmes- it adds to it. The three 90 minute episodes breeze past you at a breath taking speed- challenging your intelligence and making you yearn for more. The episodes have distinctly dark and brutal settings but are also filled with moments of wry humor that make the experience completely satisfying. The concept of using images and visual pointers in the scenes were Holmes makes his superb deductions is excellent and helps the viewer see and think with the ace detective.As for the cast, Benedict Cumberbatch is not the kind of guy who would strike you as Sherlock Holmes when you meet him in a street, but man, does he own the show! Oozing charisma, Cumberbatch plays the Holmes character to a tee-arrogant, self centered, brilliant genius. There is an air of superiority about Holmes that makes him pity the vacant minds that don't see and understand the things which seem so obvious to him and Cumberbatch brings that out beautifully. Martin Freeman as John Watson on the other hand plays a perfect foil to Cumberbatch's eccentric genius-the everyday man. Looking for meaning and purpose after returning from the War in Iraq, Watson gets swept into Holmes' mad cap world of brilliance and chaos. Freeman's earnest and subtle performance complements Cumberbatch's Holmes beautifully.Sherlock though, is not about acting performances. It's about bringing the experience of the world of Sherlock Holmes to the world we live in. Moffat and Gattis recreate the world of the Victorian detective in a completely new setting and do it superbly. Nothing about it is elementary-it is pure genius!"
tt1475582,"One word to describe this show..'excellent'. A true master piece. I am a huge fan of the original Sherlock Holmes books and TV shows. When I sat down to watch this, at the first glimpse I was a bit disappointed. The show started in a somewhat different way than I imagined. Few minutes later, I found out that the 'difference' I experienced is what makes this series unique and brilliant. The cast is spot on. Couldn't have picked a better guy for Holmes or Lestrade. Yet, Dr. Watson doesn't match the original picture.Who cares hey? The story is full of twists and turns and fascinating to see the techniques of deduction. The merging of old reasoning and new technology has been done magnificently. So, its a Holmes with a laptop and a smart phone.that who we see.and that can be easily related than those 1800's detective.Hope this show will continue for many full seasons."
tt1475582,"Once again this proves that the BBC Licence Fee is one of the finest ideas this country as ever had.Moffat's sharp dialogue and subtle character development sit excellently alongside Gattis natural flair for the uncanny and his talent for mystery stories; so evident in his novels as well as his League of Gentlemen work.The modernisation works artfully, showing that the challenges Holmes faced were not merely a question of his better scientific method keeping him ahead of the police. Watson benefit even more from the modern setting, the circular nature of history making his recent experiences in Afghanistan even more relevant than they can seem in the novels.The cinematography and editing was excellent (a feature that was much improved in the recent series of Doctor Who), the display of text messages stylish and deceptively simple.All in all this was a triumph for the BBC, and showed the benefit of their nurturing of talents such as Moffat and Gattis over the past decade."
tt1475582,Steven Moffat modernizes the classic Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) and brings him into the modern world. Dr. John Watson (Martin Freeman) is his best friend and co-investigator. I like the style. I really love the style. The chemistry between Cumberbatch and Freeman is terrific. The stories get be a bit messy but I put it down more due to the chaotic style and I do like the style. This show has a real visual energy to the old material.
tt1475582,"I am not surprised that the earliest reviews are all ten stars, I would have also judged Series one and two with that score, sadly they took something away in the latter years, the show became too clever for its own good, they sacrificed style for substance. Back to the positives, the first two series, and in fairness The Abominable Bride I think are outstanding, they are clever, witty, absorbing, genuinely thrilling viewing. The performances throughout are sensational, I cannot compliment Cumberbatch and Freeman enough, they make a great double act, and inject a massive energy. I can appreciate the show as independent from the works of Conan Doyle, but when I want Sherlock Holmes, it's Jeremy Brett I look to. Personally, the highlight of the show was Andrew Scott, who's Moriarty was nothing short of astounding, he stole every scene he appeared in, a shame they killed him off when they did. I think Moffat took on too much with this and Doctor Who, and it seemed both shows dipped at the same time, he should have made a choice and focused on one show, it was surely too much work doing both. I hope very much that the show returns, and the genius that was evident in Series one and Two returns also. Highlight for me has to be The Reichenbach Fall, which is simply incredible."
tt1475582,It's one of the most remarkable tv shows I've ever seen!!!
tt1475582,"SHERLOCK (2010-2017) one of the most brilliant and engaging British / UK series around, and one of the best internationally as well. A BBC modern adaptation of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic Sherlock Holmes mystery stories, this series is riveting, mysterious, compelling and all around good fun. While it certainly takes some liberties to keep the mysteries fresh, it still feels so very Sherlocky that is surely appeals to both lifelong Sherlock fans (the famous literary sleuth) and newcomers alike.Benedict Cumberbatch is such a clever and quirky person and plays the most excellent version of Sherlock Holmes there is to see and he is paired by the equally enjoyable Martin Freeman playing the sidekick Doctor John Watson. The two share one of the most epic and humorous love-hate bromances around and there is great chemistry there. This dynamic aspect offers endless laughs, intrigue, and heartstring tugging.The entire cast was exceptional making this series so fun to watch and it always keeps you on the edge of your seat. There will be shocks for even the most loyal literary Sherlock Holmes fans. Absolutely recommended for viewers seeking witty, clever and engaging mysteries series with thrilling twists and turns. This one is top notch!"
tt1475582,"Absolutely mind blowing series, the best I have ever seen in my whole life I can say. The actors choosing was remarkable.
Brilliant!"
tt1475582,A very good detective serie. This serie absoloutly deserves 10/10. I recommend Sherlock to everyone.
tt1475582,"What can one say that hasn't been said already?I rewatched all of the episodes recently.Of course I had seen them when they were first aired in the U.S. And like a lot of people became rather obsessed. It was hard not to be obsessed. Cumberbatch is beyond adorable and was made to be an internet idol.I enjoyed watching these again immensely. When I started I had planned to only watch the first two series because... well... as I mentioned everything has been said and it is well known things sort of go downhill in series 3 and 4.But I stuck with it because in part during these trying times in America (the virus, protests, etc.), watching this offered a modicum of comfort.I stuck with it thru the end and was surprised that I was enjoying the later episodes as much as I did.I think back in the day I had missed a lot. I was so starstruck by Cumberbatch and Scott, Graves and Freeman, that I'm not sure I absorbed everything. At least that is my story now.I found new and very interesting aspects of these shows. Especially how the plots sort of intertwine. The entire run is very cleverly written.It is of course wonderfully acted and I really can't say much if anything negative. It's funny, intelligent, witty, clever, and fantastic to look at.I have seen some comments that it has not aged well, and I see that. But I think what we're really seeing here is that it was so cutting edge and clever at the time that it was copied, relentlessly, and so what was new seems sort of old, now.So I'm glad I watched it. I had forgotten quite a bit. I still pretty much hate the very last episode (what were they thinking?). It's just awful.But overall I found it enjoyable and a lovely distraction. I may be wrong but you get a sense, watching these, how much fun it must've been to make them. What an amazing thing.Although odds are it will never happen, I'd be up for a fifth series... anyone else?"
tt1475582,"Season 1 and Season 2 are a wonderful, engaging and entertaining. Both actors did great in bringing a long loved character into the 21st century. It was fast, entertaining and captivating. Season1 and 2 deserve are highly recommended.However, Seasons 3&4 are a descent into pseudo-intellectual tripe, without a straight story line, or who's done it plot. Somehow the writers have lost the path and continuously made fun of the Holmes character by dropping him into East Enders Hell and see how he handled that bunch of human baggage. I do hope, if there will be a season 5, the writers pull their heads out of their perspective ""bottoms"" and write something in honor of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, not something in honor of their own pseudo-intellectual prowess... Very sad that the BBC has allowed it to go this far..."
tt1475582,"Season One: 10/10Themes: Detective, Crime Solving, Genius, Drama, Suspense, Friendship, Humour, Archnemesis & Socially Inept.Top three characters: 1) Sherlock Holmes, 2) Dr. John Watson and 3) Mycroft Holmes."
tt1355642,Fullmetal Alchemist was originally made in 2003 and after 6 years he received one remake following the original Manga.While the first couple of episodes are done better in the original after the 12 episode the anime just blow up in one of the best writing adventure and history I ever seen. Every character receive a time to shine and the animation is fantastic even after 10 years.You probably gonna love this.
tt1355642,"Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is amazing, I love every minute, the characters are great all of them receive a nice development, the voice acting is amazing too both dub and sub are great, animation and the choreography are awesome.This is perfect series for anime and mainstream fans, just watch."
tt1355642,"Let's make one thing clear before I start this review, I have no experience with the previous incarnation of Fullmetal Alchemist. This series was my first foray into the world of FMA, & I must say, it is VERY excellent.First off, the series has a huge cast of interesting & unique characters. They are each quite different from each other, and act in different ways. The way the series elegantly manages all the character's developments and story lines is a feat in itself. The series also has a fantastically crafted plot, filled with action, humor, & tragedy. Despite its mainstream appeal, it still maintains a mature tone that really grabs you.The animation & art is top notch. You won't be getting any poorly edited sequences or grotesque looking art. The production values are great. I watched the series with the English voice track, and the dub did quite a good job. No complaints there. The soundtrack is excellent as well, particularly the opening & closing sequences that accompany each episode.It goes on for some 64 episodes, & maintains your attention the entire time. It even manages to close everything up in a satisfying manner. A fantastic series. This show will make you laugh, cry, and even get angry a few times.Loved it."
tt1355642,"I'm not gonna lie, I don't like animes, seriously since I was a child I never feel any type of interesting from Naruto or Dragon Ball, but this one, oh boy he really put the bar on a really high standard.Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is an anime that you can enjoy even without like animes(he really resembles the Avatar for me) the story is so well written I'm impressed with the alchemy a how close is from the actual alchemy, the animation is great, soundtrack is good and after the episode 19 I'm could force me stop watching, the plot is so entertaining that when i finished the last episode my spirit was elevated to the maximum.While I don't know much of other animes this one is really impressive I definitely recommend."
tt1355642,"This review is mainly meant for anyone who watched Fullmetal Alchemist and is either considering Brotherhood, has watched a few episodes and not liked it, or has read one of the negative reviews and was put off.When I first heard about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I was skeptical. Seeing as the original Fullmetal Alchemist is the first anime I have ever completely watched and is the spark that ignited my obsessive love of anime that I have today, a redo seemed unnecessary to say the least. What could possibly be improved upon a show as fantastic as Fullmetal Alchemist? With hesitation and doubt in my heart I started watching the series... and instantly hated it. I won't lie, my first impressions were not only that the show didn't live up to the original, but that it was also an abomination that was dancing on the grave of a greater show. I cried, I screamed, I broke things, I didn't do any of the above because I'm exaggerating and not actually crazy, but I was still quite upset. The criticisms bubbled up inside me until I was frustratingly glaring at the TV appalled at such changes as Alphonse's voice actor, or a lack of the opening starting with the classic ""in those days, we really believed..."" lines from Al. With each passing episode the insults to Fullmetal Alchemist seemed to grow, episodes that were lovingly crafted in the original series were apparently being lightly brushed on. Moments in the original that got me hooked fell flat in Brotherhood, and I was fed up and ready to write the letter of complaint to end all letters of complaint. But then, my eyes began to open. Right around episode 13 where the plot of the two animes separates I started to think that this story might actually be good. As the episodes began to fly I realized that it wasn't good, it was great. After finishing the series I knew without a doubt in my mind that what I had witnessed was my favorite anime of all time. The story of Brotherhood is better than that of the original on so many levels that the two shows truly don't compare. After having my eyes opened I was forced to drop the rating that I gave to the original to an 8 simply because now I knew how much lost potential it had. If you enjoyed the story of Fullmetal Alchemist, stick with Brotherhood and I guarantee you that you will not regret it. Not only is the plot and storyline vastly improved upon and more satisfying, the animation, music (in my opinion at least, some disagree), characters, and overall feel is far better. Therefore, if you are a true fan of the original series don't give up on Brotherhood after only a few episodes like I was so tempted to do, it is a show that grows into something that will go down in history as one of the greats of animation history and you shouldn't miss out."
tt1355642,"Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a masterpiece, it's one of the best series of all time and definitely the best animation I ever watched.Great action, voice acting and amazing animation. And the philosophy about this show is very powerful.Overall:9,4/10."
tt1355642,"""Shounen"" is usually described as being an uninspired genre made for kids, with sub-par watered-down thematic execution and repetitive plot elements.Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood kills all these notions, it was the grandness a shounen has,but also has the thematic and philosophical crux, which the traditional ""edgy series"" have. The characters grow and develop, the cast is amazing and also is one of the rare Shounens anime that have indeed good female characters, story started simple but grows in a amazing and addictive way. Is smart without being overly dumb, it's a TRUE package that anyone cam enjoy."
tt1355642,"Fullmetal Alchemist is, in a way, unique. It is very much a mainstream series, with the appeal of a huge cast of unique characters, action that commonly involves special powers, a fairly straight forward story with some mostly obvious symbolism, and a mix of comedy, action, drama, and even some romance. These are all common staples of long running anime series that lean towards a more commercial and public appeal. And yet, for a mainstream series, it manages to continually surprise with a very mature and serious tone. There is a great deal of tragedy and some moments are even frightening and memorable. Few series achieve such a perfect balance of mainstream entertainment and gut wrenching drama and tragedy.Such was what I discovered when I first laid my eyes on the original FMA series. And yet, for all it's greatness, it began to flounder in it's second season. As many series do, it took on its own form and story, and it was at that point that it started to lose its charm. So, Bones did the smart thing. They remade it. For most series, this would be pointless, but for FMA, it's very much welcome. Five years after the original series ended and the manga has had time to grow, this new FMA is better looking, paced better, and follows the manga, expanding the plot in a better direction.It's hard not to like anything about this new FMA. The action is fantastic and looks great, as it always did. We aren't subjected to single shots or poorly edited sequences. All the action is displayed and wonderfully animated. Likewise, all the charm is here as well, from the more serious scenes that fans will remember to the humor which is consistent and still funny. Bones took everything good about the original series and threw out all the bad, replacing those particulars with higher quality details. In a sense, it even feels like a new anime, and by episode 13, it has gone in a completely new direction.A better developed story and characters, superior animation, and fantastic details. These are what make the new FMA an instant new-age classic. Like FMA was the first time around, the new FMA will be one of the top anime to watch out for in the states."
tt1355642,"I have seen the entirety of the Full Metal Alchemist series that was produced in 2004. The series has a sizable cast which are unique and interesting in their own way. They all have specific characteristics which make them stand out from each other and sometimes oppose each other with their philosophies. This series does things that may others attempt to do. They manage to develop the characters and their story lines in a very beautiful manner. This series has one of the best plots that I have ever witnessed with just the right amount of action, humour and tragedy all excellently blended together to create a plot that keeps you wanting more from start to finish."
tt1355642,"It's waring on my patience, the more character's that get introduced, the pointless conversations, -completely- pointless sub-plots. It feels like a lot of this show is either localized in an incredibly contrived way, or there's quite a lot of filler.Still, I really enjoyed the first 2 seasons (or Parts as Netflix is calling them) and due to the love this series has gotten I'll keep trying to watch. Not a -true- anime fan - I like Bebop, NG:E, Akira, took the chance on this and loved the charm and bounciness of the the plot of this show. I'll edit this if my opinon changes in some major way."
tt1355642,"I've seen this show recommended by many sources. Finally I decided to watch it.At first I was kinda disappointed. The first few episodes didn't make a huge impression on me. But as the story progressed and I got to know more and more fantastically written characters, the backstory started to unfold and alchemy expanded, it just got better and better.At a point I suddenly found myself addicted to the show. When one episode finished, I immediately started playing the next. The story deals with morally heavy themes. There is some seriously dark stuff in there. But there is also light. Once you experience terrible things in this show, it is truly cathartic to see some hearthwarmingly good things unfold as well.This show will make you feel very deep feelings. I have to admit to be crying at some points. It is a true roller-coaster.You will get so attached to the characters that after the series is over you will seriously miss them. That is a quality of a great show.The scope of the story is bigger than anything I have ever seen before (no joking, the stakes are bigger than in any other fantasy / sci-fi). You will find yourself truly rooting for the good guys, worrying about them, and cheering when they seem to succeed in combat against a foe.If you want to be amazed, addicted, emotionally lifted, press the start button on this show."
tt1355642,"Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I think is the best anime ever made.First of all the the voice cast were chosen to perfection every voice portrays the character as who the were meant to be.Secondly The Storyline was so well written compared to the first series. story flows wonderfully as we witness the journey the characters take and the many twists and turns that occur.Characterization was also excellent. once again I will mention the voices but also the way characters interact with the complex guidelines of the world they inhabit.And lastly the animation is very fluid no cheap faraway shots where the characters are talking but not moving which is used commonly(see Neon Genesis Evangalion).I will finish by saying that if you are going to watch one anime in the entirety of your life time Choose Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood."
tt1355642,"Ill explain why this is the best series ever made and why i feel worthy of judging that.*Note that English isn't my native tongue* I've been addicted to series for like... forever. I could probably list at least 50 full series I've seen from all kinds.If i told myself 10 years ago or so that the best series i would ever see was an Anime i wouldn't have believed it.This series made me laugh out loud, cry and bring up pretty much every part of human emotion possible. The characters and story are pretty much flawless and there is little to none loose ends. There isn't a ""stormy"" story curve as many series suffer from - where the intro - mid part or ending is to short , to long or rushed. The pace through the entire anime is good.The series does not suffer either from things like to slow riddles-to-answers rate (Lost *cough*) or to fast story.All characters are developed in a brilliant way through the series.Of all movies and shows I've seen in my lifetime - if i would have to recommend one single series to someone it would be this one without hesitation.If i had an enemy i hated in real life more than anything - even i wouldn't be so cruel as to deny that person to see this show. I could deny them food instead and it would be merciful. Thats how good this show is.One thing that was a major concern early on was that this show would be to childish and silly. Don't be deceived, it is very mature and some elements are even horrifying.This is one of the only shows I've ever seen, where i haven't been able to personally come up with better ideas on how to make it.Perfection.See it.I also recommend original Japanese voices with English text for best experience."
tt1355642,"Having been an avid fan of the first Fullmetal Alchemist series, i was highly apprehensive on hearing about this reboot, but the more i found out about the series, the more excited i became. I've always been a fan of the Manga, and the new series is being based completely of the manga storyline. This had be hooked, so i waited nervously for the first episode.The new series features better artwork that resembles Arakawa's style more closely than the last series. There is more humour, especially Ed transmuting a spear-head into his face. There is a new soundtrack, which admittedly, at times doesn't work greatly, but with some getting used too, i'm sure it will grow on me. Overall, i feel this series is a fantastic reboot, and is verging on turning Fullmetal Alchemist into the series it should always have been."
tt1355642,"I have seen both versions of Fullmetal Alchemist (Brotherhood) and both are good. In the first version (Fullmetal Alchemist), the first half of the series is really good. The fight between Edward Elric & Roy Mustang and the State Alchemist test taken by Edward Elric are notable ones. In second half, the story takes lots of twists and turns and I find it's not as impressive as the first half.The second version (Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood) is sticking to manga and has the soul of the original story. It is an all-rounded anime with tightly knit fantastic story, humorous, action packed, dark at times and entertaining. In first half, character introduction, funny moments, action sequence, ends with almost no hope situation for our heroes. In second half, the story takes it's fast pace with more action and nail biting moments.The decisions/resolutions taken by the Elric brothers at each step of their journey are clearly justified. All characters had their importance in the series, even the cute little panda and Yogi had their importance in moving the story forward. Usually when a character is introduced in the middle of a series, it stay far too superior/inferior to rest of the characters. But I like the way Olivier Mira Armstrong and Lin Yao gang introduced in the series.Sometimes when I think of watching something, I start with any one particular scene in this series and ended up watching till the very end of the series. I don't remember how many times I watched it.I have seen many anime in all genre (comedy, drama, action, adventure, thriller, slice of life, bloody ones, etc.) and in my opinion, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the best in overall. So I give 10 out of 10.When people asks me to suggest something to watch, I recommend this series without blinking. Either they say Animation is for kids or series are lengthy to watch without knowing how Japanese anime differs from Western animation. I would say one thing, watch at least couple of episodes and then you will understand why I recommend this series.Suggestion: The first episode is more of an quick introduction of main casts. The actual story starts in episode 2. So it is OK to skip episode 1. Japanese audio is better than English audio.Other suggested Animes: Cowboy Bebop, Death Note, Code Geass, Steins Gate, Hunter X Hunter, Attack on Titans, Samurai Champloo, Great Teacher Onizuka, Parasyte, One Punch Man (season 1), Boku no Hero Academia, Ghost in the shell (both movies & series, have complex plot), Shigurui (only adults, watch only if you are OK with violence & sex)"
tt1355642,"First let me say that the music/OSTs in this anime are just magnificent, there is not even one single bad opening! Every opening them is just so perfect that you can't stop listening to it! The background music is so goated! My favorite op is the 5th op ""Rain"" by SID and it's actually my all time favorite anime op, the greatest opening ever. But other than that the ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" story about two brothers and their journey to try to get their bodies back is a perfect storytelling, with a great writing to every character and a really good characters design and a nice world building plus a fine animation. Something that I really like about this anime is that how they show you all this things about the military and how you can't trust people no matter who they are and all this thing with the dogs of the military etc... I also like the philosophy in this anime but I don't want to say too much here, so if you really wanna know what I'm talking about search on YouTube ""The Philosophy of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" there is a video there by ""Wisecrack"", I recommend you to watch it if you've already finished the anime."
tt1355642,"I've always been a fan of anime that blend intricate storytelling with well-developed characters, and ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" didn't disappoint. This series, adapted from the manga by Hiromu Arakawa, is often hailed as a masterpiece, and while I found it compelling, I had my reservations.The story revolves around two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who use alchemy to try and bring their mother back from the dead but pay a terrible price. Edward loses his arm and leg while Alphonse's entire body is taken, leaving his soul bound to a suit of armor. The brothers embark on a journey to find the Philosopher's Stone, a legendary artifact that can restore their bodies.The narrative is the strongest aspect of ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood."" The plot is intricate, filled with political intrigue, moral dilemmas, and complex character relationships. It doesn't shy away from exploring the consequences of seeking power and the toll it takes on individuals and society. The themes of sacrifice, redemption, and the value of human life are woven into the story's fabric.The character development is impressive, especially for the Elric brothers. Edward's determination and resilience are inspiring, and his unwavering commitment to protecting his loved ones makes him a compelling protagonist. Alphonse's struggle with identity and the meaning of existence adds depth to his character. The supporting cast is diverse, each with their own motivations and arcs, though some side characters could have been more fleshed out.The animation quality by Studio Bones is consistent throughout the series, with fluid action sequences and detailed character designs. The alchemical battles are a visual spectacle, showcasing the versatility of alchemy in combat.However, ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" has its flaws. The pacing, particularly in the earlier episodes, can be slow, and the series assumes viewers have seen the 2003 adaptation or read the manga, resulting in some rushed character introductions and world-building. The humor, while occasionally amusing, can feel out of place in the midst of the story's darker themes.The climax and resolution of the series, while emotionally satisfying, left me wanting more closure for certain characters and plotlines. Some questions remained unanswered, which was a bit frustrating.In conclusion, ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" is a memorable and thought-provoking anime that explores complex themes and boasts well-rounded characters. While it has its share of pacing issues and unanswered questions, its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. I rate it 7/10 because it offers a captivating journey through a richly crafted world of alchemy, ethics, and the enduring bonds of brotherhood."
tt1355642,"I can't believe this show has such a high reviews. This is the definition of overhype and hyped up just because others like it and I can't believe people compare this with shows such as Avatar the Last Airbender or Attack on Titan. At the beginning I was excited for the journey and the world building. The concept of alchemy and the story of the brothers seemed promising. As the show progressed I honestly just couldn't care less for any character. It feels like the protagonists just like to fight just because. The story could have been told in a lot less episodes. The music was mediocre in my opinion first opening was fairly good but nothing memorable. Humor was funny but really overused!!I'll try watching the 2003 version. Overall I do not recommend this show. Watch ATLA, AOT, Death Note, Hunter x Hunter or Code Geass instead.Peace:)"
tt1355642,"**English is not my first language**After more than a decade, this story is still one of my loved one sagas of all times. The world building, the drama, the - so human - themes and the characters (all characters!) are the strength core of it. Plus, we have a very good animation, a impressive tied plot and pace, gorgeous music and the ten last episodes that takes your breath away.It has a world with its own laws and unique landscape and lore, that could be expanded on and on.Fullmetal is one of my loved one stories of all time, side by side with the worlds of Middle Earth, Westeros, Hogwarts and the whole Star Wars drama."

tt7923710,"I was fooled by the poster of this series with the goofy-looking characters having a good time, thinking it is a feel-good comedy. How wrong I was. Without giving away the storyline, the male and female leads are ordinary people who live their miserable lives one day after another. What is not ordinary is their humanity as they cross paths with each other, the decisions they make and the actions they take that impact the other, for better or for worse.The tone of the show is dark and at the same time we are intermittently sprinkled with rays of hope and joy till the very end. How much can you love another person, be that person your brother, son, spouse, childhood friend or... someone who was a perfect stranger until recently? How strong is your love or friendship without asking anything in return? Characters we would uncharitably reject as losers at first gradually but unequivocally become endearing to us as their life stories unfold. We feel their pain deeply. We want them to prevail and have a happier life. At the same time we understand how difficult it must be for them to break free from their past or simply from the constraints that society or the characters impose upon themselves. Despite their character flaws and their burden, none of our beloved characters demand our pity. Instead they want us to see them for who they are, to recognize their integrity and be proud of the love and friendship that binds them to each other in their neighborhood community.And what a fabulous ending that is totally in character, even if I usually dislike ambiguous endings and I do long for more between our hero and heroine. It's several days after I finished the show and yet I still wonder how they relationship will develop in their next meeting...If you rate a show based on your enjoyment after it ended and the lingering questions and thoughts it continues to provoke in you, this will have a perfect 10/10. In that respect, this is the best character-driven kdrama I have seen so far. As a matter of fact, it is among the very best shows I have seen, simply. Kudos to the directer, writer and fabulous actors."
tt7923710,"I have no words... The best Korean drama of all time. Period. This brings me to tears every time I watch an episode, yes it is emotional but not only that, it's the writing, the acting, it feels like you are in the big screen. It's a simple show but so big. It's like an ant crying 5,000 times it's weight. The lead acting is phenomenal...this tv show is a classic. I have watched 5 straight episodes in one day. I'm almost to the end but my goodness, this is incredible. This is near perfect, wow. Shout out to the people who left reviews. I turned a blind eye because of the title and it didn't look appealing. I mostly like fantasy, dynasty, Joseon type drama. Trust me I watch Live, stranger, etc. but oh my... this to show is a must watch. It gets better after a few episodes when the characters develop. Thanks for making this Tv show and big shout out to Netflix for a bigger Audience."
tt7923710,"One of the best dramas I've ever seen. Excellent cinematography, actors, script, sounds and soundtrack. Beyond all the deep meanings that I felt during the growth of the various characters in ""My Mister"" there is a constant search for peace with the world and with oneself, there is a serenity that is disturbed and sought even by the monk who initially seemed the only one to own it. There is so much to say but it's all hard to put into words ... it is simply a wonderful drama, a must-see."
tt7923710,"Started watching this drama with no expectation, thinking it is just another slice of life drama. I have to say at the beginning like at least 5 episodes it did somehow feel as such, a drama that totally people in general able to relate to and even a bit slow, boring with the many conversations in between characters and with the focus on office politics. However if you stay on and immerse yourself into any of these characters as they move along with the story plot, I guarantee you will feel rewarded on the experience of what relationships between humans really are and how we are all just surviving and thriving (or failing) in the act of being in relationships with one another. This drama stays true to its theme on exploring and unfolding human relationships - love (also self love and care), belongingness, betrayal, forgiveness, acceptance, letting go, and I can go on and on because I'm amazed by the writer nim's ability to pack so many things in 16 episodes and yet it all fits accordingly and not overwhelming the story plot at all!The existence of the male MC, Park Dong Hoon in this story and the way it is being written really carried all the other characters so well throughout the plot - he is really just an ordinary genuine ahjussi, at some point in your life, you wish you get to meet in real life or perhaps you have even met such a person before. He has his own shares of life frustration but always chose to do things that would determine the outcome of what already happened (staying in control) and not wallow in what already happened (e.g., blame or accept his 'destiny'). His attitude of if you see it as nothing then it will become nothing and life goes on, is really a good learning point in life. Try putting yourself in the shoes of the female MC, Lee Ji An, and experience the tough life she had to go through (someone who accepted her 'destiny') and understanding her reactions and actions as well as what made her blurred the line between gratitude and romance because in the end how do we, as human beings express of our love to someone whom we see as angel sent to us and telling us life is what we made of, instead of destiny. This drama not only developed strongly anchoring on these two characters but also the entire characters in the neighborhood detailed in the drama. I see it as every single characters revealed in this drama are as equally important to showcase how we all influence one another when we gather together in our lives. From relationships among family members (siblings, mother-sons, grandparent-grandchild) to brotherhoods who stay in same neighborhood (the extended society family) to the 'family' at work and to the point that even a monk character speak volume in this drama - all depicting the sense of belongingness in human beings that is so reflective of reality world. Their interactions in this drama are gems, teaching you the many perspectives of life.I am just so grateful and satisfied with this drama that lived up to its title and for the writer nim who preserve the beauty of the relationship between the two MCs without tainting it with the usual reciprocating romance theme. The most memorable thing from this drama for me, apart from the awesome casts' performances, is to slowly decipher and digest the meaningful conversations between the MCs especially with the constant illustration using metaphors. Oh and the music and bgm throughout the drama are like, prefect to the core. The whole wire tapping and listening to the audio along with Lee Ji An - every single sound was crisp clear and really made it feel as if the audience is transported into it. Also up until now there are still various vivid scenes from the drama that keep appearing to me visually, such as the walk home at the neighborhood between the MCs and the subway train ride. This is definitely one drama that will leave a big impact to you if you take a chance to watch it. It hurts a lot at certain point to come to terms with reality of life but it hurts so good because that's how you grow to be a better person."
tt7923710,"I have watched all the episodes 4 times already.
Nothing more to recommend.
Watch it and feel it.
Everything is excellent from Directing, Writing, Acting and all OSTs."
tt7923710,"I started K dramas mostly for romance and I won't be wrong if I say that I always go for genres that are listed as romance and comedy. But after reading the reviews and popularity of My Ahjussi I thought of giving it a try. When I started with it I was at the verge of dropping the show but I continued. And just after 1 episode I was hooked. My Ahjussi is not an easy watch and it won't be shocking if you cry bucket full tears as I did. But if you are looking for something deep with no- nonsense stuff then you need to be patient and watch this show.
It depicts humanity in the most purest form and the power of kindness. It has some of the most powerful dialogues backed with powerful performances by the actors. I was not able to point out a single plot hole in the whole run of 16 episode. It is a must must watch and do not miss this gem of a show."
tt7923710,I now understand why this drama is so well rated. I just finished it and I'm literally speechless. I don't even know what to say...One thing I know though. It fully deserves every star I gave it. I'd give it even more if it were possible.
tt7923710,"My Ajussi is far, far, FAR from the average Korean TV drama, though the vital part of longing and lingering feelings runs as deep as ever in this dark, brutal and beautiful story of love. Lived. Lost. Abandonned. Found.The drama is gifted with strong characters. Also in the supporting roles. All struggling and wrapped in the curse and poetry of daily life filled with dark corners and moral choices.From the perspective of a Scandinavian viewer, the story is told with a strangely familiar ""Nordic Noir"" grip and is definately some of the best Korean drama I have ever wiewed. Adding that I have viewed a lot."
tt7923710,"I have seen many Korean series. But this is the most realistic, healing, beautiful series I have ever watched. This is a masterpiece. After watching Breaking Bad, I spent two days thinking about how brilliant it is. I could not stop dreaming about Heisenberg. Similarly after watching My Mister I spent two days thinking about how beautiful , pleasant, sweet, wise this series is, I could not take my thoughts away from Lee Jian and Park.Jung hee is also my favorite character. And their neighborhood! Profound on so many levels. I have never watched a series second time. But I am sure I will watch My Mister at least twice every year. I have never ever written a movie or TV show review. This is worth it!! This is spiritual stuff!!! Don't miss it!!"
tt7923710,"MY MISTER (Naui Ahjusshi) (2018) was a k-drama that defied my expectations and left my predictions hanging out to dry. It is deep, layered, and so full of heart. At times it was tragic and heartbreaking, while others it was laugh-out-loud hilarious. It was always quirky and fresh. I can't begin to express how touching this was. There is something just so beautiful and deep about it. Wonderful acting, brilliant writing, gorgeous music, quirky realistic characters, down to earth vibes, heartfelt plots and themes...everything was so great. This show has so much heart and soul.The acting was fantastic. The entire cast gave stellar performances and all left lasting impressions. Lee Ji-eun (as Lee Ji-An) and Lee Sun-kyun (as Park Dong-hoon) were both so great and relatable. You truly feel for both of them, as people, and their trials and tragedies impact the viewer deeply. I loved Lee Ji-An's relationship with her grandmother. I also really loved Park Dong-Hoon's deep bond with his family and friends, but particularly with his brothers. The trio were so relatable and lovable. The entire side cast was fantastic as well.This drama is close to real life. It is such a beautifully complex show and all the characters are so well-rounded and realistically portrayed. There are layers of emotion and subtext between the every day lives and events of these characters. There was so much going on that kept me watching, even though the overall pacing was fairly slow and it had an almost dreamy, melancholy vibes going for it.Some viewers might not like the lack of typical romcom themes (over-the-top-silliness, unrealistic stories and excessive coincidences, mushy-gushy love at first sights, overly perfect looking cast, HEA endings for everyone, where everything is neatly tied up in a bow and everyone unrealistically gets their own sparkly magical happily ever after.) Nah. This drama brings home the feels. It brings home a meaningful story.There were so many sensitive issues and life lessons learned in this short series, such as seeing the beauty in life and in the little things, the importance of family and friends, empathy for others when we don't understand their secrets and sorrows, supporting one another through thick and thin. Overall, this was a great series, especially for mature viewers.( R. I. P. Ajusshi SKL )STORY: 10/10

tt7923710,"This drama is a unique drama that does not portray the fantasy/romance world of dramas, but instead shows the value of life."
tt7923710,"This series is in my top 3! It's a perfect 10. The script, the direction, the casting and beautiful performances. The soundtrack! Each episode is just beautiful. It was meaningful, sad but incredibly uplifting and just gorgeous to the last frame. I even loved the final credit roll. Pretty perfect production! Highly recommended."
tt7923710,A truly heartbreaking and touchy drama with great OST and awesome characters. The main actress (IU) is a gem in her role. Unique with so good acting skills as every single actor in this drama.
tt7923710,"This drama is absolutely amazing, like unpredictably good. I liked the office politics story at first but it rolls to the entanglement of the characters and the extent of their relationship making it an emotional one. The cast were supberb, IU and Lee Sun-Kyun carry the length of the drama with their acting and they portray the weigh of their character flawlessly making you sympathise with them and their struggles in life."
tt7923710,"A real tear jerker of a series: it could've been a turn off if they pitched the relationship between the lead characters wrongly, ie a young woman and a middle aged man, but it turned out very effectively done; so emotional and beautiful at the same time. The plight of the characters really affected me deeply, it's such a brilliant story."
tt7923710,"Each and every episode is fulfilling but still you will be hungry for more.In every emotional scene you'll cry and by emotional scene I am not saying sad scenes only...by the time you finish this drama you'll become over sensitive, because it's so heartwarming that it's painful.This is a drama that shows two people at rock bottom in their lives who find comfort and healing after meeting each other.This drama has lots of stories around loss, the aftermath and how different characters cope with loss. All of the characters felt relatable in their own ways.To be human anyway is not easy to understand, this drama will somewhat help you to understand it through different kinds of emotions. It really does epitomise the most purest form of love. Love without definition. Love which is unconditional, where each person has given everything they could to keep their loved ones safe, while expecting nothing in return.I am a person who believe that ""a person who is only in love with his/her feelings are never to be trusted.""
For this reason, this drama moved me more.Actors- Each and every actor, no matter how big or small their role is, they all had their moments where they moved me.IU-Though her character doesn't speak a ton of lines, but when she does, it's blunt, cold, and of few words, but you can feel every emotion portrayed by her words and actions. She showed that living itself is a brave act and she is braver than anyone.Lee Sun Gyun- His voice! His super soothing manly voice can easily make you sleep from a long tiring day.He really is a ""talent"" the way he has showed his depression and broken heart is out of this world. Those long walks, deep breaths...you can feel him, you will cry with him.Jang Ki-yong- He made a similarly deep impression on me, somehow making me care even for such a violent man.The chemistry- The chemistry between the leads was also amazing. Their actions, expressions and their eyes when they look at each other were enough to tell me how they feel for each other. No words were needed. Now, this is what I call amazing acting skills!It might not suit everyone's tastes. But I will still say that do yourself a favor and watch this drama with an open mind and heart, thinking about your life and the value of the things and people to you. You won't regret it!OST: 1. Adult by Sondia- its depressing but healing at the same time.2. There's a rainbow by Vincent Blue
3. Far away- its not an OST but ML sang it in a karaoke, it's worth listening."
tt7923710,"For me, this drama is one example of a good package. Great story, great performances, great dialogue, great visuals -- all delivered in interesting & consistent plot. It tells you the story of every main character in beautiful-comedic-emotional-enlighten way, feels like watching 30+ eps great family drama in short 16 eps. Even tho, there was 1-2 exaggerated stuff, still I enjoyed this drama. The music score ""Grown Ups/Adult"" from Sondia shares the dark-and-sad vibe whenever it's played. Try to understand the lyric and you will feel the same burden Lee Ji-an bear all time.As if I'm alone in this big world...
No one tries to look into my heart...
No one..."
tt7923710,"This is an adult, well-written, meticulously well-acted, dramatic series, with light humorous moments sprinkled in. It is a story of perseveramce amidst adversity.The first episode, which contains so much story, in, and of, itself, draws you into what will be an eventful, deep, character-driven roller coaster ride, mostly heading downhill for much of the series. It is certainly dark, mostly serious, but where it leads is worth waiting and watching for.It depicts life, in many of its worst moments, but it will not make you want to look away. I watched this for 5 days straight, because I cared so much and was anxious to see what would happen next.This show is now in my top 3. This series is so well-written and conceived--from the story, to the acting, to how beautifully, and fully-formed, the characters are, make this a precious jewel. It has everything a person could want in a great series! Believe me-DO NOT MISS THIS ONE."
tt7923710,"I hav seen a lot of k drama of the genre investigation,mystery,melodrama romance ..but this one caught me surprised..its a bit slow for those who are looking for thrillers..This drama is all about people around us.Most of the dialogues in the drama is worth seeing and will make us think about people going thru hardship..i really loved it.As always IU has done a good job.
All my favrite k drama always ends very soon after some tragic disaster.Even if it ends happily i dnt feel cmplete .but this is for u guys who love perfect happy ending..a complete happy ending"
tt7923710,"This drama is heart wrenchingly real. It is bleak, depressing, heavy, frightening but there is moments of light, love, humour and friendship. It is beautifully written, acted, filmed, edited and produced. I can't really explain what this drama is about - but mainly it is just about life and how we all get through it. With a little help a long the way by those that love us. This show is recommended to anyone - not just kdrama lovers. It has become amongst my top 5 for sure."
tt7923710,"Whoa. One of the best shows I've seen. Filled with real human drama, excellent cinematography, outstanding talent. My only grievance is the portrayal of the two main baddies - way too comic-booky for my humble taste.Everything else works, though. IU gave an outstanding performance as a wronged young woman, the male lead was a strong match. Very little melodrama, plenty of action, the dialogues are brilliant, observant, and the English translation is superb, at least for the Netflix version. Each scene is full of meaning and propels the story forward. Loved how the characters developed and didn't stay static.Along with Black, this will probably be one of the very few shows I'll rewatch later on."
tt7923710,"My mister is an odd drama with an interesting, unique plot. The first two episodes were so confusing, that I had to put it off and actually concidere dropping it. Fortunatelly, I didn't. The plot grows thick and everything falls in place after episode three, when we get to see the characters, their struggles and their real personalities and figure out what everyone seeks for. Ji Ahn was a nice character. She was poor, and she had given up on escaping her situation any time soon. Her mister, the boss of her department where she works part time, seems a simple guy with family issues but eventually, everyone around him plot for his fall. All the characters of the drama were unique and interesting, though that actress was kind of annoying at some point. I also enjoyed the fact that the story didn't follow any romantic twist, but stayed true to its dark, slice of life focus. So, great performances, great story and great characters."
tt7923710,"Just finished episode three. It's getting worse, not better. Character behaviour borders on the non sensical at times and I'm at a loss for some of the Character motivations.Is the.main male character dumb? The female main character seems to be some sort of highly trained agent specialising in covert ops, so much so it is implausible. Perhaps some twist will justify her skill set in a later episode, but I doubt it somehow.I can't understand the high rating for this show. Alchemy of Souls was far better as was Hotel Del Luna.I'd be happy to be proved wrong, with more realistic plotting, clear motivations and sensible behaviour.Ifthis show makes me cry, if will be a result if frustration."
tt8420184,"I am not from the U.S.A, I have never watched a basketball game ever, I don't know the rules and I only know Michael Jordan from a picture when I was young.I had nothing to do and randomly clicked this to watch, one of the best Netflix decisions ever.What an amazing beautifull made documentary. Without having any connection with the sport whatsoever I felt I lived every moment.Best documentary I have ever seen next to Planet Earth and thats saying something."
tt8420184,"As a basketball lover that grew up watching Michael as an idol this series called ""The last dance"" is just an amazing dream. I was only a teenager during the 90's with barely access to NBA basketball or footage. So, all the episodes are just amazing. Pretty intense, interesting and an amazing way to understand how Michael Jordan become the best NBA basketball Player of all time and at the same time understand how was his last dance with the Chicago Bulls."
tt8420184,"This documentary is about the best player of all-time in Michael Jordan and how he led the best team of all-team in the Chicago Bulls as they make a run for their sixth championship in the last year the team competed together. You don't even have to be a Jordan fan, or even a basketball fan for that matter, to enjoy this documentary. It's terrific, the only thing that I didn't like that much was how they time jumped so much. This documentary has unseen footage and candid interviews as it goes in depths into the team and the pressure they were under to win. It will make you emotionally invested whether you're a fan or not. If you want a compelling documentary on one of the best sports dynasties ever then give this a try!"
tt8420184,"As a basketball player who grew up watching Michael Jordan, this documentary was absolutely amazing! For those of you that were too young, this was a great introduction to the best player of all-time! This documentary shows both the ups and downs of one of the best dynasties in sports history and an inside look at one of the best athletes to ever walk this planet! The ONLY people who seem to not like this documentary and rate it low are 12-year old LeBron fans (not all, just the Jordan haters) who can't stand the FACT that 90% of the world thinks Jordan is easily the best ever. It's not even an argument when 9 out of 10 people believe one thing and in this case it's that Jordan is the GOAT. But that 1 out of 10 keep trying...God bless em!"
tt8420184,"Have no words to describe how good this doc is. So we'll written and directed. Perfectly edited. It has incridible interviews with lots of players, journalists, writers, family members and gives you details and a perfect vision about what was that decade. For those like me lived all that emotion, watching every game, this is a must watch doc. For those who didn't lived that, but loves the basketball, it's a must watch, to know what was the biggest team ever. And eve for those who don't care about basketball, is very enjoyable and will love the stories. A great great documentary about the most amazing team, their players, their own stories (lots of them I never heard about it) and, of course, the complete story about the biggest athlete in history. Michael Jordan."
tt8420184,"As a Pacers fan, I HATED Jordan and the Bulls because they were always the team to beat. Watching this as an adult gave me a different perspective and I have to respect Michael Jordan for his leadership and talent. I wish there were 10 more episodes to watch!"
tt8420184,Awesome and came at perfect timing. With no sports around due to current situation this show has provided much needed boost for all the sports fans around the world. 10/10
tt8420184,"I've had never liked Michael Jordan (the hazards of being a Pistons fan I guess, you grab onto anything the slightest bit negative about someone you're predisposed to not like, that confirmation bias), just like as a Tigers, Wings and Lions fan I dislike all the icons over the years with the Sox and Cubs, 'Hawks, or Bears either. The rivalries between Detroit and Chicago with all our rival teams for so many years being in the same conferences and divisions, you are almost expected to loathe each others' teams and fans.But even 25 years past it's still a real thing, whether justified or not, and I will always consider Jordan a suck for forcing Isiah Thomas off the Dream Team. Other people may be taking flak e.g. Magic Johnson now after so long to get some of it off Jordan, but at the time the sole thing stopping Thomas from (rightfully, it was a real unwarranted slap in the face to him) being on the team was Jordan, and everyone knows it.It came close to a real abuse of power, in this case star power to interject himself into a decision he should have had zero influence in. That makes it doubly ironic that he didn't help his biggest asset, Scottie Pippen, out by using the undeniable star-power franchise-making influence he had over the entire Bulls organization from bottom to top to force the GM and/or owner to offer Pippen a wage reopener on his contract. Other athletes did this all the time to help out a teammate who got a particularly horrible contract, ones with much less power than Jordan I might add. When Pippen was traded Shaq immediately gave up 2 million dollars a year of his own salary to give directly to Pippen, and they were brand new teammates with no existing relationship of any kind.That's what a classy player does, or one with the slightest lack of pervasive self regard. At the time I'd hoped it shamed Jordan a bit for Shaq to have done what he did without a second's thought, again, what a class act in comparison, but Jordan has always struck me as an Ayn Rand-type, with that ""I at least partially lucked into this lifeboat so I hope the rest of you suckers can swim"" attitude, and him never lifting a finger when he could have with absolutely no detriment to himself to make sure one way or another than the league-wide disgrace over the pittance Pippen was paid was rectified. There was no downside to Jordan to help out someone who's supposed to be not just your most needed teammate to help you do the magic, like Messier to Gretzky, but also a friend.But maybe that really ruthless way of looking at every opportunity or situation on or off the court as toward one single goal, winning, blinded Jordan to this really easy opportunity to do something truly righteous and with the kind of fortune Jordan amassed through sponsorships he could well afford to shave a couple of mil off his Bulls salary to help out Pippen who had arguably earned that money right off Jordan for how they had eyes in the back of their heads knowing every second where the other one was on the court, it was uncanny.And I haven't even mentioned the series yet I know, but I wanted to give the full context about how many different things I don't like about Michael Jordan before saying how much I loved this documentary series. I'm a big fan of documentaries, but especially longer series versus a feature-length, where the director and writer(s) can really dig into a subject. I watch the classic older docs like ""Victory At Sea"" or ""The World At War"" that Laurence Olivier narrated so well, and I try to watch every decent documentary series from all over the world as much as I can (other than cheesy ones with inaccuracies that don't dig very deep into the subject matter, like those churned out by ""history-themed"" cable channels).I came into this wanting it to be a total hatefest on my part while watching, about this documentary was so riveting in that way that it makes you forget yourself as well as any preconceived notions one has about Jordan; maybe that is why this has really proved popular beyond all expectation in this weird time we are in. It is the ultimate escapism for a sports fan particularly, and even more particularly when sports of any type are in short supply. And I found something so very unexpected happening inside me, deeply in a way, as a person, seeing Jordan's humanity so fully exposed as it was bound to be with so many thousands of hours of film to go through, it changed the way I feel about Jordan completely just through the reaction of my own basic compassion I develop for anyone I get to know, and I feel like through watching this I really got to know Michael Jordan, the person, not just Michael Jordan, the player.Beyond reliving something in a way that makes you feel you're right back to all those times if you'd been a basketball fan that long, and feel like you're back there still even if you hadn't been born yet maybe. The series really uses framing of the different time periods very subtly, but while still shifting the mood seamlessly in a second flat... I don't think I've ever quite seen that before. I just turn 50 and this series brought me back with such potent nostalgia to my 20s that I felt like I did watching some of those games for the first time ever, a virtual time machine, and though I still don't like some of his actions and choices back then, ""The Last Dance"" made me like Michael Jordan, the man. Maybe even love him. And considering my starting point, that is something."
tt8420184,"We saw Michael Jordan on the court for several years, but this documentary brings you in as if you don't know how it all ends. This documentary is very well put together. It begins the first two episodes with flashbacks between the early start Jordan's career and college days to the career high of champion seasons. The story then moves on to Pippen's story with a similar order (early days then career high), but also a challenging relationship with team ownership. As the series moves on we will get to Rodman and more of Phil Jackson's history with Chicago. The Last Dance is definitely a must see."
tt8420184,"As a 18 year old boy that has never seen this team playing live, after watching one episode of this series I felt very excited about the history of Bulls and especially for the Joradn's ""Kingdom"".
You should give a try on this series, undoubtedly!"
tt8420184,"I'll start by saying that the show was mostly good. I remember waking up at 4 am to watch the live playoff games, so it was nice and nostalgic. I wasn't a Bulls fan and wanted Utah to win it, but the show made me appreciate the Bulls more.
Having said that, it looks and feels like the show was directed by Jordan himself. Even when they try to show other sides of him, he comes out almost prefectly clean on the other side.
I especially didn't like his arrogance and mistreatment of teammates and opponents (like the way me laughed at what Gary Payton said). I understand that in order to make a documentary about Jordan, you need his approval, but I feel it crossed a line.
In addition, I think there were too many explanations about why he wanted to win (because, evidently, only winning a championship isn't enough). It was always: the coach said that, so I had to show him, or this player dared to try and win, so he deserved a lesson.
So it's a good show, but it's a one man show, and way too kitschy for me."
tt8420184,And this has been a great insight. Never before seen footage makes this a must watch documentary of MJ.
tt8420184,"Two episodes in and I am like, give me the whole show, today now i dont give a f... how much does it cost.. Cant wait for the next episodes.... MJ the first sport idol."
tt8420184,The greatest sports documentary ever made. I have watched this all the way through at least 8 times now and I never get tired of it.
tt8420184,"An amazing and detailed documentary about jordan, one of the best and greatest athletes ever, not just a basketball player.Considering a total of just over 8 hours, his entire career has been shown through numerous unpublished recordings, interviews and photographs. Although the title the last dance represents his last season in a Chicago bulls jersey, the documentary touched on literally everything in his career. I think that a lot of effort has been invested in building a project like this. Just collecting and restoring old shots seems like an eternity. I especially liked that this is not a typical documentary with a linear plot because every bit of the plot goes back in time when it is related to the appropriate story or person. The documentary is further enriched with many people from Jordan's private and sports life, so we can see some events from multiple perspectives, there is his family, his teammates, but also rivals, opponents and people who are totally unknown to the public, but are always were with him. Although i knew most of the things from his sports life and how games ended, when he dropped out, when he won the title, how and against whom, i still felt a certain tension and excitement because of the way the documentary showed everything and some minor things which i didn't know, but all together it's great connected so we have depth of the overall story and career. From my perspective Jordan has always been big and untouchable. The bulls were the best team and Jordan their best player. The fact that Toni Kukoc, as a Croat from Split, was an important wheel of that machine, certainly helped. This is where i see the only complaint with the whole project. Many players got a bigger stage light in the documentary (probably because they're Americans so they're more interesting) than they objectively deserved with their games from Kukoc who was the third Bulls player in importance and statistically. But I don't want to talk about it now even though i could really do a lot about Kukoc, but that's for some other, sporting discussion.Definitely a recommendation for all fans of sports, basketball, and i believe for those who are not so interested in sports. I've watched these ten episodes in three days, and i'd have watched it before had i had more time because it's really great done from a film perspective."
tt8420184,"I'm huge fan of MJ, having watched him since his NC days. I watched every Bulls game during their championship seasons. I also scored floor seats to his last game @ the United Center when he came back w/the Wizards. (In case you're curious how he was received, arriving with the visiting team - to a standing ovation that lasted so long they had to blink the lights.) This miniseries is PERFECT, it's so well done, it's such a precious gift during quarantine. Watch it now!!"
tt8420184,The game of basketball nowadays has evolved. Jordan is the reason why basketball became popular GLOBALLY. Also the kids nowadays need to see why MJ is the G.O.A.T. and not LeBron James.
tt8420184,"From episode 1 to episode 10, it has been an inspiration knowing about the story, the struggle, the win and the lose within basketball!The way direction of episodes and clipings are done, it simply gives chillzz to me."
tt8420184,"This documentary gives us what we've all wanted. A peak at the lives of The Bulls beyond what we know. And a perfect picture at the dominance and greatness of one, Michael Jordan!! This will help paint a more vivid picture of the greatness of this man and these players. Can't wait for more!! Can't get enough!!"
tt8420184,I have never seen a documentary more detailed then this one it showed me the in's and out's of 90's basketball and the story of why mj is the greatest.
tt8420184,"I really liked this documentary. As a kid growing up during the MJ years, it was a beautiful slice of nostalgia. However, I take some issue in the editing choices. I was perfectly aware of everything going on but still found the back and forth story telling a little much. It began to feel like the drama was being lost in the back and forth for me. Still great."
tt8420184,"It started well but as it went by it became a kind of a tribute to Michael Jordan. Honestly, and regardless of the magnificent athlete he was, I doubt that his image comes out well from this show. Before I remembered him as the greatest. After, I am not sure. To be great, you cannot be a bully, a too much self esteemed character, rude for your partners. No matter the good you are, you have to be a good character too. For me, Michael Jordan does seem to be one."
tt8420184,"I loved the 90's bulls and like so many was obsessed with their success. Here is a great insight into why they didn't get to 7, 8 or even 9 championship rings.
You have the arguably the greatest dynasty in sports history and like so many times before, when something doesn't need fixing, in comes personalities and egos to mess everything up. The last dance is as compelling as it is heart breaking, as the question of ""what could've been?"" looms. It's a comprehensive breakdown of the events that lead to the break up of the greatest sporting teams in history.
Wonderfully captured with deep insight provided from the people that were actually there. While simultaneously flipping back in time to give us a deeper understanding of how the key players got to the position they found themselves in. This has been 20+ years in the making and so far very much worth the wait."
tt0167260,"This movie, and trilogy in general, is a cinematic (and literary) masterpiece, and simply refuses to get old. I love this movie so much it's become a tradition to watch the Lord of the Rings series at least once a year! It's just as good as Christmas"
tt0167260,"I've just re-watched The Lord of the Rings trilogy for the 1000th time tonight... nearly 15 years since the Fellowship of the Rings was released... I still haven't seen a movie that's better, nor close, to any of these three films. The casting is perfection as well as the incredible acting by everyone in the movie. I can still watch these movies back to back and not get bored. They are a light to this world and wouldn't be the same without them.I miss the good old LOTR's days. The best movies ever created. The Return of the King was the best way to end a thrilling journey through middle earth!"
tt0167260,The greatest tragedy of the human race is that they will never make a better movie than Return of the King.
tt0167260,Best movie in the trilogy and sealed in the best possible way
tt0167260,"All the threads of Tolkien's magnum opus come together in the most elegant of fashions in the final part of Peter Jackson's adaptation. Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.""Return of the King"" is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.The cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien's creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect.Now that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for.A masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own. Well deserving of all the high praise thrown at it, and then some..."
tt0167260,"Nothing even comes close and I may well not see it personally topped. Every single scene is magnificent. The acting is superb as is the direction, script, hauntingly beautiful music, cinematography and the incredible battles; especially the hour long battle on the Pellenor Fields and Minas Tirith. The characters
are some of the greatest ever created and to root for. The movie is simply perfection from beginning to end and the 4 hour version is just as majestic. There's not a single negative thing I can say about a movie that deserves all it's nominated Oscars. My family and I watched it 4 times in its first 12 days of release. A joyous experience every time. Magnificent!!!!!!"
tt0167260,"Wonderful on every level. Love the characters and special effects. One of the biggest, most massive battle scenes ever put on the silver screen. A great end to a monumental epic."
tt0167260,"I admit it, I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy, some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.My only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.Despite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don't distract too much and the lighting is authentic.The score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in.The acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result.All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0167260,"Obviously, I'm aware of the fact that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually one giant movie, but since it was released in parts, that's how I'm judging them. The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.At this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters, and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come.This is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.These were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best, in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm one of them.Sorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that's a bit depressing.My rating: 10/10"
tt0167260,It is the best movie I can remember I've watched while I was a kid!
tt0167260,"First of all: I liked this movie, and i could watch it an awful lot of times. But that is mostly due to the great special effects .The point i rated this movie a 7 is because of the stupid story mistakes Peter putted in his movie. Especially the ghost army is a huge, huge mistake. Everybody who readed the book knows the ghost army does not take part in the huge fight, but only conquers the pirate's fleet, so Aragorn and his men can sail to the battle. The orcs think they get some backup when they see the black sails, but then are overrun by Aragorn, not the ghosts.Like the thing above there are more things which i do not like. Like the snowboarding Legolas in the battle for Helm's Deep (not this movie, but still). Legolas is indeed quite handy on his feet, but snowboarding on a shield? These are just the things which made me personally think Peter could have come up with a much better movie of one of the best story's ever written."
tt0167260,"I was rather hyped for the third part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, as I suppose everyone was. Unfortunately, I found it boring and lacklustre. The Return of the King barely exhibited the epic quantity that I awaited from the finale of the trilogy. It seems that by this time, the whole crew was tired of the project. Also, the omissions and changes to Tolkien's original are most glaring in RotK. The movie just whizzed by and I failed to be impressed. Maybe the Extended Edition would prove to be a more rousing experience. The normal edition, however, despite its efforts, remains a lacking ho-hum finale to what began as an impressive filmatization of the Lord of the Rings tale."
tt0167260,"I suppose that someone, sometime, may tell the story more accurately but I doubt very much that it will ever be told better. Nothing could ever replace the books for pure escapism but Peter Jackson has managed to evoke both the feel and texture of Tolkien's masterwork without pandering, too much, to clichéd Hollywood extravagance. The cast are superb (if Sir Ian Mckellen is remembered for nothing else other than Gandalf I feel sure he would not complain), the cinematography stunning and the pace, even over the 8/9 hours for the whole trilogy is matchless. For those who have read the books (as I have for many years) I would suggest watching once to get all of the niggling storyline changes/omissions out of your system then just watch as a pure, wonderous, unadulterated piece of epic, EPIC cinema. I'm sure I will love it forever."
tt0167260,"Saying that this film starts where `Two Towers' left off is somewhat misleading, for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helm's Deep. `Return of the King' opens with a flashback of Smeagol (Andy Serkis) obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of `Two Towers,' at that's the ring. The first installment, `The Fellowship of the Ring,' provided heaps of exposition on the ring's importance and influence, and in `Return of the King,' we see it pay off, big time.After the armies of Isengard have been defeated due to an allegiance between Theoden (Bernard Hill), the king of Rohan, and the elves, the main threat to middle earth is now concentrated in the kingdom of Mordor, controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron has turned his eye towards the realm of Gondor, the last free kingdom of men, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) must warn Denethor (John Noble), Steward of Gondor of the impending attack, while Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), heir to the throne of Gondor, and Theoden gather men to aid against the armies of Mordor. The dark lord Sauron needs only to regain the one ring of power to conquer all of middle earth, and two hobbits, Frodo (Elijah Wood) the ring-bearer and Sam (Sean Astin), must continue their journey, directed by Gollum, to Mount Doom, the only place where the ring can be destroyed. Got all that? If not, you need to bone up on your `Lord of the Rings' before expecting to follow this film.Since all three epics were filmed simultaneously, each individually has the feel of being part of a larger picture - except for this one. `The Return of the King' is just too big, the most epic of a set of epic films. Now that director Peter Jackson has brilliantly constructed the characters and plotlines throughout the first two films, he puts them to use.All of the characters have their best moments within this film. The pair of mischievous hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), are no longer the tree ornaments they were from `Two Towers,' but are split-up, and take their characters in completely new directions. Aragorn, played with an unmatched sense of honor by Viggo Mortenson, is about to meet his destiny as the future king of all men, while Andy Serkis continues his expert portrayal of Gollum (Serkis' provided not only the voice of Gollum, but also assisted during production by acting out the scenes of the computer-generated character with his fellow actors).However, the real acting triumph of the film is Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins. He continues his descent into corruption with an incredible talent that many could not pull off. Wood's performance is so critical to the film because it determines the ring's power to corrupt, which, needless to say, is absolute.The first two films established Jackson as an incredible visionary, shooting vast landscapes from his native New Zealand. With `Return of the King,' Jackson really gets a chance to show off. With, hands down, the most beautiful visuals of the trilogy, Jackson makes `Return of the King' a gorgeous feast for the eyes, while never resorting to McG level over-the-topness. Jackson stays very grounded in his characters, not letting the effects tell the story, but only assist the wonderful dialogue and characters. Think of `Return' as a mix of `Fellowship' and `Two Towers,' with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event of this magnitude.The bottom line, fans of the films will not be disappointed. Hardcore Tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by Jackson and the other writers, however, it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels, being that film is an entirely different medium. Despite the alterations, Jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text, while adding some of the finest filmmaking ever put to screen. `The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made. Not only the best of the trilogy, but a crowning achievement in epic filmmaking."
tt0167260,"I am in awe of the knowledge of some of the reviewers. I've been disappointed with virtually every film version of a beloved book that I have seen. I have not studied ""The Lord of the Rings"" though I have read the trilogy twice and parts several times. I know what a scholar Tolkien was and admire his work in linguistics as well as storytelling. The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo's character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here? I'm not going down that road because, of course, the Bible is an epic too and has its own story. This is a movie about how friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice will out against evil. The evil is so remarkable and so oppressive.I can't begin to talk in the terms of other reviewers, but I do need to make sure that I weigh in on this film and the other two because this is a product of our society that we can all be proud of."
tt0167260,"Frodo and Sam continue their desperate journey to destroy the ring, Gollum has his eyes very much on the prize, knowing they cannot possibly get past Sauron's army, Aragorn creates a diversion.Surely this is a contender for the greatest film of all time, I can think of nothing negative to say, it's everything you want in a movie and more. Action packed, intriguing, funny and several scenes that will pull a few years from your eyes.The greatest battle scenes of all time, they are as relentless as they are breathtaking, if you like action, this is the film for you.There isn't a single lull, at no point does it ever dip, it doesn't matter which character the focus is on, it captivates, that opening sequence with Gollum was off the scale, as was the final, epic battle.I will only watch the extended version, as I find Christopher Lee's absence in the theatrical cut unforgivable, I know it's about four hours long, but that doesn't matter, you lose all sense of time in the wonder and brilliance.McKellen, Mortensen, Wood, everyone associated, incredible.This film truly is one of the best ever made.10/10."
tt0167260,"As a movie watcher, I tend to become bored with the constant, overdone, overdrawn, underplayed, overdramatized performance and production quality of most Hollywood films. It's a trait that in recent years has sadly driven me away from most big budget American films. A decent idea will become mangled by the money making machine that is Hollywood, hoping to pump the most raw cash they can out of it before it drops dead in the street.We all saw the catastophre of a failure that arose from the Matrix Franchise. Such immense hype and professed genius only made the failure all the more poignant for those of us that really wanted and expected more from the franchise.That all being said, I must say that The Lord of the Rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience. Not even just a visual experience. Peter Jackson has crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into THE quintessential epic. He supplements the brilliant storytelling of JRR Tolkien with one of the most awe-inspiring collection of films ever created.The 7 hours of film that leads up to the Return of the King is only precursor though, when you sit and watch this film. It's just plain brilliance. Everything about the film is wonderful. The manner in which Jackson has arranged the scenes, detracting slightly from the original flow of the novel really helps to keep the suspense strong in all three story branches. The Tolkien humor is intact perfectly and the gallantry and just plain coolness of these heroes is plain amazing. (Check out Legolas in the BIG battle) It's all just too much for words.If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I personally believe that this is the only way such a film could be made, true to the source material and completely engrossing, but I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after 4 hours (including ads and previews) that I had spent in a cramped seat. As such, this will be all the better (at least for me) when it's release on DVD (can't wait for the extended...get to see the Sauroman scenes that they cut out).As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinema. Bravo Mr. Jackson."
tt0167260,"This movie made me love Cinema. Some movies mades you love that genre, this made me love Cinema. It's not perfect since there are no perfect movies actually. But this one is the Achievement of being the closest to the perfect for me.This movie is the best movie of the all time for me, clearly. I just gained my Cinema love with this movie. And I watched more than a thousand movies. I watched so many directors from so many countries. My cinema taste changed too much since my first watch of this movie. But this movie is still the best for me, not even a single movie reached to it's level. This is why I think the movie is the best movie of the future also. I don't think my thoughts will ever change.This movie is not about the war of men and orcs or any other peoples. This movie about the insignificant people versus the worlds biggest thread ever. That thread is actually unbeatable.""You did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron? There are none who can. Against the power of Mordor there can be no victory.""
Saruman""Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch.""
GandalfBoth dialogues from the first movie. One of them telling us evil side is unbeatable and the other one tells we have a Hobbit. Brilliant and the most effective storyline. And they adapted it amazingly well!"
tt0167260,"Man, and you thought Titanic was cheesy?! When I first saw this film on the big screen, the multiple endings bothered me only a little. Now that I saw it for the second time, they simply outraged me. Best adapted screenplay, best director and best picture of the year all went this way. This time: not deserved. The Return of the King ends five times. FIVE TIMES!! I don't give a good goddamn if it was that way in the books too. I never read them. And that gives me a good position to rate this as a film and not a screen adaptation.Every single time Elijah Wood laughs in this movie (in the entire trilogy actually), I almost throw up. Couldn't they make it any more cheesier?! Especially stomach turning is the scene at the end of the RotK, where they all laugh and hug by Frodo's bed. OF COURSE in slow motion to add a little more sappiness. Plus the scene where their journey has ended and they all sit in the pub and skål their pints together.. check out the expression on Wood's face. So cheesy I laughed my a** off.The most worrying thing about all of this is that without the cheesiness and the multiple endings, this would've really been a great movie. I don't love them, but I do like these films. And it was such a tasteless display of drama from the academy to pretty much dismiss the two previous movies and award the last and most tasteless one in spades. It made the whole thing feel like the ""Russell Crowe-syndrome"", as I like to call it. They didn't award him the statue for The Insider, but instead for Gladiator the next year, because they probably felt so guilty. Maximus after all was clearly a more easier role than Wigand and didn't deserve the award as much.I can see why so many love this film and embrace it, but people, eleven Oscars? No.** / *****"
tt0167260,"In short, a very, very good film which would have been the trilogy's best and have gained a 10, had not it not gone on so long. I get the feeling Peter Jackson didn't want to end the series, and so made the final film last as long as humanly possible. In the end it just gets tiring.I really will not be watching the extended version, which may well stretch to five hours. Why couldn't they just do a Kill Bill on it?Oh well, I don't want to try to put you off, at 7/10 it is still well worth a watch, just don't try to watch the whole trilogy at once. Not without a family-sized KFC bucket, at least."
tt3032476,"Someone is responsible for making this such an outstanding show, year after year. The intelligence in dialogue, empathy for characters, twists and expectations are genius. Breaking bad, The X Files are 2 other badges of brilliance. We are privileged to be living in this time as we might have been if living during Shakespeare. This may seem over the top but the scores are on the board, Vince Gilligan. Please correct or remove if I am wrong!"
tt3032476,"People who are fans of Breaking Bad should definitely watch this it expands the Albuquerque criminal underworld to unparalleled heights. It's easily one of the most tragic, beautifully written and directed shows of all time and for me at least is at the top of the list of my favourite shows it's tied with Breaking Bad. I'm not really someone who's into the crime genre but this show as well as Breaking Bad are two all time great crime dramas that I actually LOVE. It's a master class of writing and direction. This show is the fastest show I've binged I finished the first 4 seasons in a matter of 3 days. Season 5 isn't out in Canada on Netflix yet."
tt3032476,"As of today, it's officially been 9 years since Better Call Saul was released. It's been a little over a year since the finale aired and I'm still mesmerized about how this crew lead by Peter Gould & Vince Gilligan pulled it off, again.When Breaking Bad reached its finale, it was hard for me to imagine any other show being able to reach it's level, let alone arguably surpass it. And when I heard that there was a spin-off regarding Saul Goodman, I thought maybe the show could have some solid and funny moments, and maybe bring a bit of depth towards some beloved Breaking Bad characters.Spin-offs in television are usually seen to me as fan service, or a way to make more money off of a franchise that was loved. That doesn't mean that all of them are bad, but most of them don't have the passion or care that'd make you think it was extremely necessary to make a spin-off, especially considering the risk of making previous characters look bad writing wise. And while Better Call Saul was AMC's idea to make more money off of the franchise, I'm shocked with how the creators and writers were able to make another masterpiece.This show was always meant to be in the shadow of Breaking Bad in my eyes, and I never would've thought of these shows as something that'd be deserving to talk about in the same breath as one another. But Better Call Saul took the ball that Breaking Bad was rolling, picked it up, and launched it forward.While I think Breaking Bad has peaks that no other show can reach, Better Call Saul was able to do things that it's predecessor never could. The depth and writing of these characters are honestly perfect. So much so that I'd consider the shows leads Jimmy and Kim to be two of the best written characters in television history. And while the cast of this show is extremely stacked, Chuck McGill to me is a character that's honestly overlooked compared to the rest. His character has a pretty clear consensus amongst most people, but there's so much to him and Jimmy's dynamic that's it's honestly not as black and white as most people make it out to be, despite both being objectively wrong in certain aspects of the series. It's really fascinating to me.The main aspect of the show that baffles me is how perfectly timed the arcs are considering this is a prequel. Every event in the show is written so well and is paced in a brilliant way to the point where no character arc seems to be rushed, yet the show still remains interesting. You think you've reached the pinnacle of a characters journey, then a curveball is thrown that changes everything.That's not even mentioning how balanced both the lawyer side and the cartel side of the show are. When I first started the show I was eager to get more of the Mike and cartel portion, but the lawyer side of the story honestly paved the way for the first half of this show and was the most compelling part of the first 3 seasons.My word of advice to anyone who watches this show.1. Be patient
2. Understand that this is not Breaking Bad.At some point the show will get very intense, but enjoy what arcs you are given at the time because before you know it, you'll look back and realize you were in the good times of the show. If you watch Better Call Saul after watching Breaking Bad, you might ask for one thing early on. But when you actually get it, you'll realize that the destination wasn't the key, but it was the journey to get there.Considering most of the characters in this show were never even supposed to exist, it's safe to call Better Call Saul a miracle in television. Whether that was because of an actor wanting to be written off, an actor having a busy filming schedule, or a throw away line that created two of the greatest characters in the entire universe, it's amazing that Breaking Bad was able to pave the way for one of the greatest shows of all time. But what's even more impressive is Better Call Saul makes it to where Breaking Bad is not even complete without its existence.Kudos to Peter Gould, Vince Gilligan and the entire crew that returned to create Better Call Saul, and I'm grateful I got to experience this universe come to a close."
tt3032476,"Had heard nothing but amazing things about 'Better Call Saul' (with nothing bad), with it being one of the most highly regarded shows in recent years. Am a huge fan of 'Breaking Bad', so was really psyched in seeing its prequel 'Better Call Saul' too. My opinion of Bob Odenkirk is also very high, so there was absolutely no way this was going to be missed. Have binged on many shows in the past seven years or so and was determined for this to be one of them, very like 'Breaking Bad'.'Better Call Saul' was every bit as amazing as reputed. Have seen many shows that started off wonderfully but declined badly in their final seasons, a few with really bad last episodes ('House of Cards', 'Game of Thrones', 'Killing Eve'), but then there are rarities like 'Breaking Bad' where every season was at least positively received and on the most part universally acclaimed. 'Better Call Saul' is another one of the rarities and is the first show seen in a long time to not have a bad episode in it, since 'Breaking Bad'. Seriously compelling and addictive stuff and exceptional in every area.Visually, 'Better Call Saul' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.The writing for 'Better Call Saul' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, although quite talky, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The pull no punches and gritty approach to the subject was often chilling and harrowing to watch. The direction couldn't be better.Likewise with the acting, with Odenkirk on absolutely towering form throughout as one of television's most fascinating and meatiest leading characters, one that one is repulsed by but also one that is not hard to sympathise with in some situations. Rhea Seehorn and Michael McKean are excellent as well, McKean giving one of his best work in years. The character writing is rich and compellingly real.Concluding, truly outstanding show. 10/10."
tt3032476,"""Breaking Bad"" was undeniably one of the greatest shows of the 21st century. If you then hear that one of the characters got a spinoff show, you could be forgiven for doubting the quality. Well, doubt no more. ""Better Call Saul"" is an equally fine piece of work.The protagonist is lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), who it turns out is actually named Jimmy McGill. He engages in all manner of shady activity, while other characters from the previous show have their own things to deal with. As with the previous show, it's a serial, with episodes ending in cliffhangers. And make no mistake, you'll want to keep watching.Basically, it's the type of series that you have to see to believe. There have been lawyer shows and crime dramas, but never have they gotten combined so splendidly. It's the perfect mix of comedy, tragedy and thriller. Definitely see it."
tt3032476,"Better Call Saul is not only considered one of the best shows of the last few years but it's also considered one of the best shows of all-time! The acting & storytelling are so good that it really does becomes addictive to watch. There's a reason why this show is one of the highest rated shows on this site and why it's always nominated for so many awards and that's because it's freaking amazing! People always want to compare it to Breaking Bad because it's a spin-off but don't. Even though it has the same feel and it's not quite as good as Breaking Bad, it's pretty darn close! I, along with everyone else who watched, was worried how they would end the show and hoping they wouldn't mess it up (like so many other great shows tend to do). Well, they didn't! The ending was fantastic and will go down as one of the better finales to a great show. If you are a fan of Breaking Bad then this is an absolute must watch!"
tt3032476,"One thing that stopped me from watching this movie is because I knew this show has nothing to do with Walter White, the man that makes Breaking Bad, Breaking Bad. I believe most people also think the same.Personally, after rewatching Breaking Bad few times, I have come to the conclusion that there is nobody in the show that I love from the beginning until the last second. What I like the most is the character development for all the important characters.Then? What does it have to do with Better Call Saul? I believe I love this show as much as Breaking Bad because of the exact reason. I REALLY love how every character behaves and develops in this show. What more fascinating is, this show has everything you like from Breaking Bad. Tension, emotions, atmosphere, character flaws, good antagonists, you name it. One other similarity this show has, this show gets better when it is closer to the end. (I know, it has not ended yet) You really don't want to miss every second of it.I can assure you, all Breaking Bad fans, your love to this show will be AT LEAST as big as your love to Breaking Bad. Easiest 10/10 after Breaking Bad."
tt3032476,"This show deserves more recognition.
Better Call Saul is the most clever show I have ever watched. The acting, cinematography, the story, the writing, it's amazing.
Some times even better than Breaking Bad."
tt3032476,"Better Call Saul has a 8.9 rating for a reason and that's because it's fantastic! It's absolutely one of the best shows ever created! The acting, writing, storytelling, etc are all as good as anything that's ever been on television. This was Emmy nominated for most outstanding drama every season it was on. The cast, led by Bob Odenkirk, are all amazing and all perfectly cast. There's not a weak link on the entire series. This is one of the rare spinoffs that is as good as the original. I'm blown away how they kept this show feeling so fresh and where every season is incredible. If you haven't seen this show yet then do yourself a favor and go watch it as soon as you can. Just warning you now though to give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge it as fast as you can!"
tt3032476,With every episode it gets heated a bit...... and you won't even realise when the water stars boiling......
tt3032476,"So here it is at last: one of the most highly anticipated new TV-shows of the year, the spin-off from probably THE most highly praised TV-show in the history of Television. Naturally, expectations were over the roof - and it was a forgone conclusion that meeting those expectations would be next to impossible. Well, here's the good news. Judging from the first couple of episodes, 'Better Call Saul' will be good. Just how good remains to be seen, but as far as promises go, those first episodes made a big one.For those who haven't seen it yet: relax - I won't spoil a thing about the storyline. Instead, I'll concentrate on all other aspects of the show. The first thing you notice (as was the case with Breaking Bad) is the camera. The photography is simply gorgeous. All the visual trademarks I've grown to love so much in BB are there: the playful camera angles; the creative ways to establish even a simple scene with unusual, interesting shots (yet without ever distracting from the storytelling) - it's just beautiful to look at. Then there's the music. From the wonderful introductions (before the opening credits) to the last scene of an episode, music is not just used as background ""noise"": carefully picked songs are there to give clues and are as much an integral part of the story as they help establish the tone of certain scenes. And the original music by Dave Porter feels as organic to 'Better Call Saul' as it did in 'Breaking Bad'.The writing, directing and acting (so far) are on par with BB; anyone afraid this would be a rushed production trying to surf on BB's success can relax; not for a second did I get the feeling this was somehow not well thought through or cheaply constructed by a committee of writers - and although we do of course get some of our favorite characters back, new ones are introduced that promise to be just as original and interesting as the ones that helped turn BB into a cultural phenomenon. And adding high calibre actors such as Michael McKean ('This Is Spinal Tap') to the cast is probably an indication that Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould will not content themselves - or us - by mainly exploring the characters we already know. And then, finally, there's the magnificent Bob Odenkirk. Starting off as a slightly one-dimensional character and comic relief in BB, the character we've come to love as the sleazy, slick Saul Goodman has already shown more layers in the first half of the first season of 'Better Call Saul' than over his entire run on BB. And that's as much thanks to Odenkirk as the fantastic writing: the actor obviously relished the opportunity to show what he's capable of as his character charms, squirms and threatens his way through his scenes, but - somewhat unexpectedly - he also manages to move you during the more quiet moments. To sum up my overall impressions: 'Better Call Saul' is a darkly comic, multilayered story that could end up being just as unusual and exciting as we all dared to hope. The tone may be consistent with 'Breaking Bad', but make no mistake: this is very much its own thing. The writing, directing and acting - as well as the production values - are top notch, and if what we've seen so far is anything to go by, we're in for a great first season of a very promising new show. My (provisional) rating: 9 stars out of 10Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
tt3032476,"Let's face facts: Spin-off TV shows tend to fare poorly to the original content. I was furious when I heard about the spin-off to the amazing Break Bad. Nonetheless centering around the buffoonish clown of a character Saul Goodman?! I was livid and heartbroken. I wanted Breaking bad to end on a high note and not let this potential disaster ruin it's legacy.Breaking Bad was an absolute masterpiece of a show, with an amazing story, script, cinematography; you name it, it's there. But the one thing that made Breaking Bad shine, and in my option, be one of the greatest series ever made was it's deep, deep burial into the characters that made us either absolutely love or loath them. It didn't rely on special effects and had no fat to it whatsoever. No other show encapsulated a slow unfurling of characters so well that it was as if we were getting to know them in our real lives.I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot after hating it's first episode on release. I figured, maybe I could eventually forget about the fact that it was attached to my favorite TV show, and when everybody who watches it is telling you it's amazing, there must be something there.. right?Boy, were they right. Better Call Saul is just as good as it's predecessor. It maintains it's very high standard to every aspect of the production, and most of all, character development, motivation and relationships are centerfold once more. It is easy to find Better Call Saul even better than Breaking Bad, although I would chalk this up to it being more current and therefore more in the forefront of our minds in the Breaking Bad universe. If you, like me, have hesitated to give this show a shot for the same reasons, stop it. Let yourself feel uncomfortable for the 1st half of the first season, and then let it get it's clutches into you.I'm so, so very happy I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot again 4 years later. With no hesitation, 10/10."
tt3032476,Better Call Saul Seasons 1-5First few seasons were pretty good (mainly due to the relationship between Jimmy and Chuck) but these later ones ain't doin it for me.The story line is excruciatingly boring and boy is it stretched to the max. The Characters are uninteresting and the chemistry between them is completely fabricated. Couldn't care less about any of them. Pacing is completely off and most of the acting is just dreadful. This show became so unrealistic to the point where it feels like I'm watching a corky cartoon. I'm not sure why a director like Gilligan would release a show of this quality when he possesses all the traits and talent to of made this much better. It's Kind of an insult to Breaking Bad.
tt3032476,"Ok I've tired to like it but it's boring. Mike and the cartel more interesting than anything Saul life brings to the table. I care more what happens to Mike and his life than Saul problems, not to mention Saul just a douche! I gotten to the point that I'm just watching it to finish it. I'm already halfway through season 6 and feel like there wasn't anything memorable of any of the seasons. I hope the ending doesn't suck! Breaking Bad had me dying to watch the next episode. I sometimes goes days without watching it and could care less. If you think about it if Saul would have DIED in season 1 everyone's lives would be better off & the show would have been better!"
tt3032476,"Yet another masterpiece delivered by the amazing Vince Gilligan. Everything about this show is almost perfect. The writing, acting, cinematography are just beautiful. Also one of my favourite aspects about this show is the character development, and how well it covers two different parts of it's whole timeline (Jimmy/Saul's life at first and then getting into Gus Fring and the Cartel), something that hasn't been done as well in Breaking Bad. I truly think this show is one of the most underrated around and would definitely recommend watching it"
tt3032476,"Many people say that this show is better than the show that started it all, Breaking Bad. And while I don't agree with that, Better Call Saul puts up a really good fight and ultimately has become my second favorite TV show of all time(the first being Breaking Bad). If you go into this show expecting it to be similar to Breaking Bad, you're not going to enjoy it. Even though they are in the same universe, Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul are pretty different. There are two stories being told in the show. One story is the story of James M. McGill,(Saul Goodman in Breaking Bad) a man who's struggling with his career as a lawyer. And the other story is the story of Mike Ehrmantraut, a man who gets involved with the world of crime. Similar to the film Inglourious Basterds (2009), the show tells two different stories that collide for the ending. Each story builds up, adding more and more details to the plot until they both get to a point where they collaborate in an incredible and jaw-dropping finale. The show is also masterful at making the viewer understand exactly how each of the characters think and act. It makes you feel like your best friends with each of the characters in the sense that you know everything about them. What makes them angry, what makes them happy, what their interests are, etc. The show also has many easter eggs to Breaking Bad and answers some of the questions that were never answered in the show. The cinematography is also phenomenal. From the variety of bright and beautiful colors, to the camera angles, it's gorgeous to look at. Another great thing in the show is one of the many themes portrayed in it. That theme being that the law isn't perfect. Jimmy and other lawyers are able to use many different loopholes in the justice system to get their way. The final episode especially, shows that even though many people think of the law as sacred, it is anything but perfect. The acting is also great with Bob Odenkirk giving a phenomenal performance. Another story that this show tells is the story of Saul Goodman after the events of Breaking Bad, which are filmed in beautiful black and white. This part of the show is especially entertaining to the Breaking Bad fans. All in all, if you liked Breaking Bad, I would highly recommend this show. In my opinion, it was definitely worth my time. 10/10."
tt3032476,I don't remembering rating and reviewing a TV show before but for better call Saul I had to. Its just too good.
tt3032476,"Exceptional cast just as good as Breaking Bad, writing is superb, soundtrack is so good, cinematography shots are very nice, and entertainment value is bomb! I'm surprised Bob Odenkirk hasn't won any of the Emmy nominations he's been up for. I'm a few seasons in when I started the series I wasn't reviewing then, glad I'm watching the show again I forgot how good it is. I love that the same crew from Breaking Bad is involved!"
tt3032476,"I loved every second of the first two episodes of Better Call Saul. We are beginning the season with many strings left untied but I have complete faith in all questions being answered. If you loved Breaking bad for all the reasons I did including the cinematography, music, scenery, characters and most of all the story line, then you will love this. I apologize for going slightly off topic but in looking back at the breaking bad episode with the fly in the lab, some people found that they did not enjoy this episode, I on the other hand loved it. I appreciate the pure genius of the directing that goes behind every minute of the show. I understand and respect that people are entitled to their own opinion but after reading the negative reviews given here about ""Better Call Saul"" all I can say is that they don't get it, and that is OK. It is worth a watch because if you end up enjoying the show you wont just like it, you will love it. This is the next life changing show that will become something you look forward to for many years. I am truly excited for what's to come."
tt3032476,If you have seen breaking bad and haven't seen this masterpiece of a show and you're hesitating don't just watch the first episode of the show and it will hook you but if you haven't seen breaking bad i suggest that you should watch breaking bad first forget the timeline and forget that breaking bad is after better call saul there are some things in breaking bad that are presentend as mysteries and if you watch this they are no more mysterious and no more exciting.
tt3032476,The 2 seasons are kinda slow but trust me it gets better every episode and i love all of the scenes in Better Call Saul!
tt3032476,"Better Call Saul has its moments but the really good episodes are very few and far between. There's a lot of dragging out in this series, some episodes are just a load of different, boring subplots that you have no interest in but you just sit through it hoping that something interesting will start happening eventually; and it does, but it's a very slow climb to get to a point where the plot really starts to grab your attention.I'd say it's definitely worth watching for those golden moments, just be prepared to sit through a lot of slow-paced waffle. The latest series (5) has been the best so far in my opinion, because the main plot is finally starting to take over all the subplots and the show is becoming a bit more action-packed.I wouldn't say this series is better than Breaking Bad purely because the pacing is terrible, but it has been nice to see what was going on with all the characters before Walter and Jesse came along, and it looks like as we move from season 5 to 6, Vince is starting to make up for all the boredom the viewers have had to endure up to this point.Overall, it's a pretty good series, worth watching, but I think 10 stars is a bit over-the-top for something that crawls along as much as it does."
tt3032476,"(Just a rhetorical question. I don't really want an answer.)Over a few days, I watched all 10 episodes of season 1. The show seemed to be popular and I wondered what I was missing.I'm still wondering. I can't think of any reason to watch the show.1) Characters are unrelatable and unsympathetic. 2) The..... pace....... drags........ so........ so....... so....... so....... slowly. (""Did we fill an hour yet?"")3) The ""plot twists"" are ridiculously predictable unless you're about 9 years old or less. If this show surprises you...well it shouldn't.4) The writers jump multiple barracudas in each show. Things that CAN'T happen in real-life pass for normality. Yet none of the anti- reality events are used to advance whatever hint of a plot the series has.5) Lots of silly, unforced issues with minorities and women.I think the acting is pretty good. (For example, Rhea Seahorn has to convince us an attractive, intelligent, well-employed woman with little free time is willing squander it to platonically mother a pathetic, unreliable schlub. ACTING!) The actors try to save the weak writing.The filming is well done and the retro mood is usually witty and only slightly overplayed.This might have been a decent 90-minute movie where you walk in, walk out, and move on. But as a series, it was painful to watch. I was glad episode 10 showed no hint of sucking me into season 2. It was a relief to hit the delete button and free up dvr space."

tt5182866,"I can't stress it enough that watching a piece that is so simple will be the one that touches your soul very closely.If you are doubting whether you should watch this show or not because one of your friend suggested you to, TRUST THEM COMPLETELY.I will tell you how your days will go after watching this show. First, you have to trust all the good reviews in the world and start watching. Second, you will enjoy this show starting from the first episode. Third, nobody will tell you to continue watching further, but you will anyway. Then after finishing this show, you thank your friend. Or should I say you will thank yourself because you chose to finish this show? Doesn't really matter.I find at least 3 reasons why people are doubting this show.First. ""Isn't this show just like any other friendships movie/series?"". Short answer, it's NOT. Don't get me wrong, any kind of good friendships film will definitely warm your heart, I always love friendships films. However, there are too many other treasures to talk about that you can find in this show. Role of moms, dads, admirers, crushes, dreams, siblings, fate, boys gang, girls gang, exes, education, morals, marriages. And why are they even important? Because you will then REALLY understand to be in other people's shoes.Second. ""There are not much going on in 1988, is this even relevant? Isn't this extremely boring?"". Well, definitely you won't find any fancy things here. No fancy fiction things just like any other korean dramas, no major plot twist or whatsoever. My question is, why is that even a problem? Really you don't have to worry all of those questions. The show will still feel very close to us that you really want to be one of the characters. Unfortunately, rewatching the show again and again will be the only way you can make your dream come true.Third. ""I can guess the plot. There is one girl in those friendships, so it will just be triangle or rectangle love story, just like any others."" Again. Please do yourself a favor not to worry these things. There are sooo many things that you can talk about rather than worrying if there is good romance aspects or not.Last thing I want to remind you because you have arrived to this review.
PLEASE. THANK. YOUR. FRIEND."
tt5182866,"Reply 1988 outshines its predecessors. This drama connects us to the nostalgic memory lane of simpleness of life for average people and emphasizes the camaraderie between families, friends, neighbors & every one. It is correlated with the cultural aspects of the past and shows us the boundaries where one might stopped existing. But this drama helps us relive the past and appreciate the generosity and oneness of humanity. This is a genuine drama that gives moral lessons. It motivates us to be courageous, take care other people, to give love and don't expect anything in return. Made with infinite class."
tt5182866,"A show means you watch you get entertained and after that you continue with the life you have, but im lost on which episode i started living with this show, culture, characters and life routine. Im broken now that its ended, too much attached and i think the reason for it can be explained as the mellowness of the show, you are peeling an orange the show is being played and a small laugh brightens your day followed by a goat sound, after a while you are attached truly."
tt5182866,"I'm just thankful I got to experience this drama. It's the best one I've ever seen. It made me feel like I'm living in 1988. It was so relatable even though it's from a different timeline and a different country. It's heartwarming, funny and makes you feel empty when it's over. The second time I watched it I was depressed for 3 days because it felt like I've lost life long friends, it's that good and I know I'll feel the same again. I was amazed that it was the first time I didn't have any complaints with a drama. Great acting, great story, great music. You'll feel like you're watching normal people live their lives but it's interesting."
tt5182866,"Actually, I am not South Korean, even I was not born in 1988. But this drama makes me feel deeply in the same way. I love them all forever."
tt5182866,"Initially, I would have started this review with ""first of all""... but it would have been inconsistent with the tens of ""first of all"" I'd started with. Why? Because this Korean drama is amazingly accurate in depicting the '85-90's period and idiosyncrasies!... And this appreciation comes from a non-Korean, non-Asian, Hollywood movie-goer, >30's person. Nevertheless, I have never seen a more realistic depiction of common people and their struggles throughout that particular period. I know what I'm talking about because I've experienced it in my neighbourhood and with my family. Because of this and others more, I felt compelled to add my unacquainted review to IMDb.
Bottom line... if you really want to see some great acting (Kudos to the actors!!!) and get an amazing feel of the 85-90's (and this is coming from a non-American, non-Western point of view), I highly recommend this series!"
tt5182866,"I've never liked rewatching, but now I've just finished rewatching it and enjoying it, maybe even more than the first time, I will certainly re-watch it because I miss the characters so much. In the meantime I've watched Reply 1994 and 1997 which were very good but not as good as the 1988
Maybe it's one of the very best TV series of all time"
tt5182866,"This series made me reminisce my youth days. I can relate so much too about family, neighbors, friendship, and even the culture because korean and filipinos has so much alike when it comes to culture. It made me realize that youth days with friends are the best day of our life although we didn't know it before."
tt5182866,"REPLY 1988 (2015-2016)Family. Friendship. Love. Youth.One the best kdramas I've watched. Most scenes have touched my soul. Made me miss my family and friends back in the Philippines.Big salute to the screenwriter, Lee Weo-Jeong and the director, Shin Won-ho! The actors played their parts brilliantly! I love Deok-Sun(Hyeri) and Taek(Park Bo-gum) the most. Colourful characters! Thank you all for making me laugh, cry, laugh, cry and ruminate on life.10/10 for me. 👌💞👌Funny but with depth. 💖"
tt5182866,"Best Kdrama I have watched in years. It officially dethrones My Mister (My Ahjussi) as my favorite Korean series.Reply 1988 is set in the year 1988, it revolves around five friends and their families living in the same neighborhood of Ssangmun-dong, Dobong District, Northern Seoul.This series resonates the family values that everyone should foster but most failed to accomplish. Reply 1988 teaches its audience about hope, generosity, unconditional love, gratefulness, friendship, hard work, perseverance, acceptance and a lot more. It's so good that it knocks your humanity and questions your core values. The series has no villain but only misfortunes and heartbreaks. The show's impact lingers to your senses and encourages you to choose the good path, appreciate your loved ones more and be the best version of yourself.Reply 1988 has 20 episodes with more than an hour long each. Despite of that, it never wavered its greatness from beginning to end. I cried and laughed almost every episode. None of the characters has failed to deliver. Even young Jin-ju's cuteness will leave you a mark. Watch out for Jung-Bong! This young man has skills and tricks up his sleeves.One of the photos for this post is Jung-hwan and Duk-seon. Why? Because I shipped them so much and I extremely felt sad when the show ended without giving their romance a chance. Not even a genuine confession. Nonetheless, I am celebrating because the two actors who portrays those characters are dating in real life.The camaraderie of Ssangmun-dong neighborhood is unparalleled. It manifests how a small community builds, changes and cultivates someone's life and legacy. If this series doesn't move you, it's time to evaluate your values and principles.Watch this series and thank me later."
tt5182866,"A nostalgic look as a group of families living in Seoul. The highs and lows as they face heartbreak, disappointment, and success and jubilation. Each episode is one and a half hours and is quite slow in evolving the drama, but is well acted and the underlying story of we may be poor but we are richer in many other ways is the theme. Although it is a romanticised and dramatic account of family life, people will recognise small snippets of their own families. A little too sentimental for my tastes but I can understand why people rate it so highly as it does have a rich positive message."
tt5182866,"My boyfriend and I made it a nightly routine to watch one episode of Reply 1988 through Netflix party before we go to sleep. We're both not used to watching super long episodes and have no expectations at first but we're glad we tried this one! Loved how the show not just depicted romantic love, but love for friends and family in its purest form. Super worth it with all the feelings it gave us. I loved it so much, hence this post, that I wanted to jump into my screen and live in Ssangmun. I loved Sun Woo, Jin-ju, Mi-ran, Jung bong, Dong Ryong -all of them actually, but definitely #TeamJungHwan!"
tt5182866,"First time ever to watch K-drama Series for each episode almost 2 hours (between 1,5 hours until 1:50 hours) and it's addictive, sad, funny blend perfectly in one. The setting year in 1988 so great, very detail for cast wardrobe, houses, electronic etc. one of a kind for this K-drama Series, rare to find series similar to Reply 1988."
tt5182866,"I can't say goodbye to Ssangmundong.
This show is one of the best shows i've watched in a while. I liked how this didn't focus only on the leads' romance but the love between friends, and family. I feel like i grew up with them, in that same Ssangmundong street 10-2. I laughed,cried, screamed at the characters every episode like i was a part of their group. It was so heartwarming to see all the relationships between the families..i mean where do we get to see friends like this and neighbours bonding with each other!
This show was so realistic without being overly dramatic and cringy(i like that too ;) ) The best thing about this was the simplicity of the show and the characters. They didn't use mobile phones or any hi-tech gadgets..it was just pure communication with landline phones and face to face <3
This show taught me the value of friendship and family.
I cried more in this last episode than i did in any other episode
Thankyou, the families and friends living in Ssangmundong. I'm glad i grew up with you. T.T
I'll make sure i visit often."
tt5182866,Every emotion is concentrated in everyday life. Every character has flesh and blood. Every sensation can make people cry. It's just a funny story.
tt5182866,"Started watching reply 1988 after frequent recommendations from my sister, turns out it is the best decision ever. This is one of the greatest television drama people need to witness. Some scenes are gut wrenching at the end. It literally broke me to core, get some tissues ready before starting. Brilliantly written directed show. This show needs to ranked among the best shows in the world. Before this i had only watched Chernobyl with more than hour long episodes, i had concerns
before starting the series about the length, but it will never make you feel it is 1:30 hr long. My only concern was Jung hwan didn't get proper closure at the end."
tt5182866,"Adore the 90s ambience and neighborhood-friendship chemistry they build. Those super relatable life lessons at the last 20 minutes in every episodes. Despite how annoying your family are, they wont make you feeling the pain of exclusion.Hilarious and painful in the same time!"
tt5182866,"After Parasite winning the Oscars, I became curious in other film and TV works from Korea. I watched Reply 1988 and it opened a whole new world to me. I have never seen a TV show like this. It was absolutely amazing how well the storylines are written and the characters are developing each episode.The cast is top notch. They blend drama, romance and comedy perfectly. The older experience cast gave the story richness. The younger cast did an amazing job and the chemistry was real. This is what real friendship looks like. Their coming-of-age story lines are touching and entertaining.The show is much more than the often discussed love triangle. It shows love in a much broader and deeper way between friends, parents, siblings and family.The story has a lot depth. It has references to actual events happening at the end of the 80s, like the Seoul Olympics and the pro-democracy protests. It captures that zeitgeist perfectly. I did not understand all the cultural references to pop culture around that time, but I could certainly appreciate it.Reply 1988 is Korean, but at the same time it tells a universal story in a unique and brilliant way. Therefore, it transcends different cultures. It will actually teach you valuable life lessons. And that makes this show an absolute gem to watch."
tt5182866,"Then, Episode 17 happens, and you're left scratching your head in frustration. But more on that later.The first 16 episodes are a beautifully crafted coming of age drama/comedy. Interesting characters, their ups, their downs. Amazing chemistry. You can sink into your chair and watch these actors do their work for hours at a time. It is comfortable...and comforting. A soul food kind of show. A few gripes regarding prolonged (excessively) teen angst and indecision. But its perfectly forgivable.Important nuggets of information are presented from the past. So, unlike many shows, the flashbacks work!The flash-forwards however DON'T. The time spent in 2015 is a complete waste of screentime. And it adds nothing to the flow of the show. In fact, the way it is presented is a bit cringe worthy.THEN.... EPISODE 17. Now I don't know if they realized they were going to run out of money before completing more episodes, or there was a contract dispute, or the ratings were low so they had to cut the show shorter than planned, but EPISODE 17 is an ABOMINATION of epic proportions!They took a perfectly paced comfortable show for 16 episodes and sped it up like playing an old 33 record on 45 speed. Plus, plot lines that just end. Others that begin out of nowhere. And this jumping year after year until it is 1994. Terribly executed and totally unnecessary to the spirit of the show up to that point. Compound it with inexcusable life choices, inexplicable relationship break-ups, and your left with an utter mess. Gone is all the good feeling. Now, you're left with an abridged version of a show that is speeding its main characters towards adulthood, all in the span of 60 minutes. This after close to 20 hours is spent developing their beautiful formative years. It seemed like such a cop out. And you knew the inevitable was coming.....What is it you ask? Well, what does every Korean show have, and can't do without?Yup, you guessed it....an EPILOGUE.But in this case, the epilogue is FIVE HOURS LONG spanning the last three episodes (ep.18 through 20). It is pointless. All the events could have been hinted at back in 1989, and left to the viewers imagination. But no! The writers have to show you exactly what you knew would happen, and cram all the plotlines into 3 episodes. Highly disappointing last 20% of the show. All that time would have been better spent finishing up the high school years and leaving the rest to the viewer's imagination.A strong NINE (9) stars for the first 16 Episodes.A weak THREE (3) stars for the last 4 Episodes.My advice, watch the first 16 episodes and stop. Then think up whatever ending you want in your head. You'd probably do a better job than the writers did."
tt5182866,"I think it's the first time that I feel like I was ""played"" by the reviews so much. I've been watching kdramas for some time now, and I kept postponing watching the reply series, because I read so many good reviews about them and I wanted to watch them after I've watched other dramas of ""lesser quality"". Let's say I was keeping the best for last.So I started with 97 which I rated with 5 stars. But I managed to watch it. Then 94. I managed to watch only the first episode and rated it with 3 stars. Then I tried to watch 88. I only made it through the 2/3 of the second episode.I have no idea why this is considered to be great. The production quality is definitely better than the other two. The acting is decent. BUT.... There are so many annoying characters. I kept feeling frustrated watching them. Especially the sisters. They were acting like they were 8 years old at best. At some point the little brother (age 17) started crying and calling for his mother because his sister hit him. Seriously?I've read many comments about the realism of the series. This is definitely not true. Unless people in Korea actually behave like this.I'm sorry but this is unwatchable for me. I know this review is going to get mostly negative feedback but I feel like I had to write it. Such a shame. I really wanted to like it."
tt5182866,"Game of thrones? Breaking Bad? Sopranos? Friends?Crash landing on you? My mister? Signal? Goblin?You just name more. Masterpieces, ha?Don't bother. They're fighting for the 2nd place forever.It's that simple.Genres? Personal tastes? Don't bother. This show is beyond all those.Nobody will ask but you'll watch it over and over and over.Each time, you'll realize how strong prejudice you had and you wouldn't believe it's getting better and better each time you watch it again.Don't get me wrong. This show is THE best from the beginning.You just don't know how perfect this show is at the first watching even if you already gave 10 stars."
tt5182866,I loved this one! All the reply shows are very good and so is this one. I loved it so much! The characters and actors were so enjoyable to watch! The storyline was solid throughout and let me just say I love the guessing who she marries part and not revealing it until the end! It sets these series apart from others. Really unique! I'd highly recommend if you enjoy nostalgia shows and Kdrama! And I'm shred you'll enjoy who the girl marries in this one too. Although this one was the toughest one in my opinion on who she chooses. I really loved both guys but the one I had pictured she loved was correct and I was happy but can't help but feel for the second lead. You'll understand what I mean when you watch it.
tt9432978,"I know i might be exaggerating a bit or i might I be over-reacting a bit .. But this is getting out of hand.. How the hell are these TVF writers not getting proper recognition for their work... This is simply outstanding work from them.. Series after series they are producing gems which we as human beings can only just applaud to.. Starting from pitchers, permanent roommates,tripling, yeh meri Family, immature and then KOTA FACTORY.. I know everyone is telling that tvf is trying to give stiff competition to amazon & netflix but i think it's vice versa.. Amazon & netflix are trying to give stiff competition to tvf....They may not have the resources to show mammoth battles or big fat Indian weddings but they certainly have the writing prowess to make you cry, laugh,be sad, happy,nostalgic all at the same time."
tt9432978,"Every single minute of the premiere episode was well directed and each member of tvf team., Thank you guys for making such wonderful series ."
tt9432978,"It's not hard to make a tv series especially on a topic that you have lived... It's like making or writing your own stories so it was not hard for tvf guys because they have lived the life themselves. But, it is not a web series like other. It is a study of the situation and not simply presenting the situation. How we feel, why we feel it, how does it impact our behaviour voluntarily or involuntary. Everything has a meaning including the black and white scheme of the series... Which describes a rather colourless and one dimensional life of a student who has been living with blinders. The while series is a study of all this behaviour.Thank you from bottom of my heart..."
tt9432978,"Whenever anybody would blame about the lack of quality content in India (I include myself too), they are given subtle reminders in the form of some of the most amazing shows. The irony to the same and complain about content, however, is the fact that there is a barrage of shows and films that either go unnoticed or just don't click with many viewers.TVF (The Viral Fever) is one of the flag-bearers of making the digital scenario the massive juggernaut it is today. Responsible for Pitchers and Permanent Roommates, the channel has now presented another show in the form of Kota Factory."
tt9432978,"Excellent acting, beautifully written..describing reality and truth.."
tt9432978,"Some series are much more than just times and stories they are about lives. It is that. Untold stories told with such rawness makes it more than anything tvf has ever produced. Script, acting , direction, cinematography, music everything just adds to the flavour of Kota. Brilliant. Touched my heart. Thank you making it."
tt9432978,"Portrayal of reality at its best. Great script, acting and specially that b/w theme, although b/w but depicting the true atmosphere and backdrop of Kota. Striking hard from the first episode, looking forward for more."
tt9432978,"Tvf Tvf TvfBeauty again.Direction-Acting-Music-TopicEverything falling right in placeJeetu Bhaiya , Meena toh jaan hain.."
tt9432978,"TVF has been doing the work which needed to be done by mainstream film industry. Content creation is not just a business, it involves love for the filmmaking medium and passion for storytelling. I am happy that real and impactful subjects are coming in web. Kota factory is well made, well acted and primarily tells the story of students who are stuck for two years in Kota's coaching town in hope to crack IIT exams. This rat race for engineering has ruined lives of thousands of students and this madness still is on. Hopefully people can connect to this amazing show and we can watch mainstream movies from TVF soon."
tt9432978,"Everything about this show is great. Whether it be acting, screenplay, direction or dialogues. It uses brilliant and striking black and white cinematography to express the loneliness, darkness a student has to go through in claustrophobic kota.
Kudos to TVF for this great show. This is a must see."
tt9432978,TVF guys are presenting a harsh truth about Kota with fun N comedy !! Thanks you TVF for this.
tt9432978,"Every year in India 700,000 of students prepare and compete for 5000 odd Spots at the prestigious IIT colleges. Kota factory on TVFplay is a show about a handful of students preparing for the premier entrance exams for those spots through the coaching centre's based in Kota, Rajasthan.Kota factory uncovers most of the problems faced by these students right from the politics behind admissions, placement of batches, living conditions, study materials, quality of teachers, internal politics of the coaching centres, Marketing techniques, teaching methods, freedom, campus fleecing, friendships, student lifestyle and tons of other problems faced by these poor kids.Acting of Jitendra Kumar as jeethu Bhaiya a swashbuckling teacher was outstanding. Most of student's acting were natural and good. The show is shot in black & white, which adds a contour on the dull lives of the students. Direction, editing and cinematography were decent and Songs were top notch. Shooting in the real location has really helped the outlook of the show. A chemistry rant by the lead, Vibhav in episode 3 was simply outstanding.The web series is a much watch for all the Lakhs of students and ex-students who studied in the hundreds of coaching centres in Kota and elsewhere. But it must be duly noted that all work and no play will make students dull and sorry to say that the students of Kota look dull. In my opinion, for a perusal of a better life, a lot of the parents don't hesitate to destroy their kid's lives. The failure and rejection would be too much for the young kids to handle. I wish the makers had brought this up too instead of marketing the Unacademy app in the series."
tt9432978,"Season 1 was the best part of this series. Season 2 just disappoints you in every manner (except Jittu Bhayia). As it went from TVF to Netflix, it looks like it's motive went from education and life experience to lust. Almost every supporting character looses their arc and didn't really hold relevance in the story. They directed that this unhealthy competition is not be problem but your lack of determination, nad only and only your problem."
tt9432978,"Unique idea of black and white cinematography along with brilliant direction deserves nothing less than 10 stars.
This is more than struggles faced in the quest for success. This is something that everyone watch and different things can be learned from it. With a well aligned story this series offers us entertainment as well as education.
Wonderful actors like Jitendra add wonders to the already well written script.
Bollywood and senile directors like Karan Johar, Ekta Kapoor come and watch this offer us something better."
tt9432978,"Being a Kota Factory produce myself, I had my share of doubts before the starting the series. Doesn't matter what the final result is, Kota days remain a mix bag of good and bad memories.Thankfully, I made the right choice. Kota factory is very well researched and captures not only the obvious but also the little things that are intrinsic to Kota life. The salty water, obsession for patties, reading English literature while being bored just to ensure your time is optimally utilised - all make the show very real and relatable.The director also walks the thin line of optimism and pessimism around Kota gracefully. While the show reflects the positives of Kota, it also portrays the perils it entails for a student, ensuring the reality is not misrepresented. The monologues of Jitu Sir are lucid, pertinent, and are well received."
tt9432978,"Jeetu rocks as always. Apart from acting of main character, everything is awesome. Reality is shown in best possible way and TVF knows how to play its cards right. May be my personal favourite, I can tell by watching the first episode, after pitchers."
tt9432978,"This show encapsulates the entirety of the student struggle and the zeal of being praised upon. We live in a system that only rewards students who are good at regurgitate unoriginal information. These intricate stuff would cascade into being a complete introverted isolated individual.
Love the cinematography and the writing!"
tt9432978,"This show hits you at the right spot, even though i never allowed myself to be consumed by these coaching notions, I always felt bad for these Average low confidence socially isolated classmates who came as a failure from Kota."
tt9432978,"The first season was mostly about showing students how about balance school life while teaching you life lessons, and it does that very well.But Season 2 takes all of that and improves in every way - the direction, story, characters, the change in tone and the dialogue."
tt9432978,First season was great but the second one finds its hard to even be called a GOOD.The second season was just the result of Netflix buying the show. Being an IIT Aspirant myself I find it very relatable but the second season did not work for me.
tt9432978,Best indian series ever created . It's shows the real struggle of an Indian students
tt9432978,"An excellent take on the competitive world of post-school education and coaching in India, Kota Factory nails every single aspect of being a 10th passout looking to enter an IIT. But what makes the 5-episode mini series a worthwhile watch is not the description of the life of such a student but the the freshness and partial didactic approach that aims to educate the viewer about the real goal. A must-watch for both students and parents. TN.(Watched for free on YouTube.)"
tt9432978,"I have watched this show with high expectations and I'm just down with both the seasons. The screenplay, cinematography, acting is a solid 8 on 10. However, I still find (and very honestly) this show to be overly trying to be ""cater to all"" issues in 10 episodes.The show starts with a very sincere attempt on what goes on in Kota coaching classes. I've been through all of this and I could relate to the first couple of episodes. However, from 3rd episode onwards, I found the characters unreal. Almost every character (be it, shivangi, jeetu or our main guy) is shown to be a very opinionated, full of wisdom and extremely confident in their demeanor and life choices. This is far (extremely far) from how reality of Kota going students is. This is where this show astrays from this core storyline. Things like, students in live-in relationship with loved ones, students going and roaming around Kota blowing off steam, all very casual, free, inter-gender talk around highly societal taboo issues like mensuration, masturbation and in general long term life advice seems extremely unnatural from students of 11th and 12th. And I'm not even including the fact that these students have from here for IIT coaching and as such students who do go to Kota and get admissions in few top institutes there have literally no time to pursue any hedonistic pleasures and their love interests. This is where characters lose their integrity and authenticity and they look forced and completely fictional.In summary Kota factory (TVF) is trying very very hard to cover as many societal issues as they can in 1 story. And in doing so they have created characters and storylines which seem unreal and unconnected."
tt9432978,"Story, screenplay and PERFORMANCE- excellent!! The third season is just fabulous. Jitendra Kumar is truly remarkable throughout this series. Writers deserve a standing ovation. I mean its been a while since I have enjoyed something so much. It is a beautiful joyride taking viewers from emotion to humor. Thankyou for making something truly substantial making people aware of the reality that goes on in the lives of students today. All the characters portrayal is so close to reality that only a couple of minutes in and you feel that this is something going on in real time. The last episode is my most favorite. Brilliant!! Must Must See!!!!"
tt9432978,"The second instalment picks up from where its debut season had left off, with Vaibhav Pandey (Mayur More) switching from Prodigy Coaching Class to Maheshwari Coaching Class, as the latter is a better institution when it comes to IIT coaching. The story revolves around Vaibhav's, his friends', and classmates' mental anguish as they prepare for the IIT entrance exams. Will they give up or will they triumph in the most important struggle of their lives ?Created by Saurabh Khanna and Arunabh Kumar and written by Abhishek Yadav, 'Kota Factory' is set in the ultra-competitive student ecosystem of Rajasthan's Kota, a place where vulnerability and trauma abound for students preparing for the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). This sequel, too, is one-of-a-kind, thanks to its spot-on humour and relatable existential struggle experienced by the protagonist.The first season of 'Kota Factory' follows Vaibhav Pandey, a teenager who enrolls in a coaching institute that prepares students for the IIT entrance exam. His friends and competitors, Balmukund aka Meena (Ranjan Raj) and Uday (Alam Khan), gradually assist him in adjusting to this high level of academic pressure. However, near the end of the season, Vaibhav clears Maheshwari's admission entrance exam and is torn between his heart and mind about whether or not to enroll in the best coaching center in town, which has a high success rate. The second season, on the other hand, picks up right where the first had left off, chronicling the protagonist's trials and tribulations, particularly after he has to adjust to a new learning culture in Maheshwari after leaving his friends and love interest Vartika (Revathi Pillai) behind. Will he be able to persist in the face of such adversity, or will he succumb to the pressure? That is the question that the creators are attempting to answer.Directed by Raghav Subbu, this five-part 'black and white' series highlights the issues that IIT-JEE aspirants face in their day-to-day lives. It gets viewers emotionally invested in the students' journey and the guidance of their one and only physics teacher, Jeetu Bhaiya (Jeetendra Kumar), who serves as a modern-day Dronacharya for them. The narrative eloquently depicts a wide range of emotions, including optimism, angst, love, companionship, and even doubting one's own life choices-whether they truly want to follow the course that appears to be carved out for them, or if they can forge their own path. Briefly, the narrative does emphasise the importance of family support as well as the difficulties faced by youngsters who are unable to cope with the competitive pressure. However, the creators should have paid a little more attention to the delicate aspect of students contemplating quitting in order to give the plot a larger perspective.Overall, the series stands out by providing high-octane emotional scenarios that are complemented by a well-crafted background score. Additionally, meaningful songs like Amit Trivedi's 'Main Lad Lunga' provide depth to the character's emotional agony. Without being too dark to watch, the close-up shots convey a sense of the claustrophobic environment as seen through the eyes of students.Similar to the previous season, Jitendra Kumar plays a pivotal role in the show. As teacher, mentor and supervisor, Jeetu Bhaiya is the only one who understands the students' problems and encourages them to confront them. Even his motivational talks, such as ""don't dream, always aim; since dreams are imagined and aims are to be achieved,"" leave an impression.Mayur More plays Vaibhav to perfection. His character is primarily shown overcoming the challenges of fierce competition, which is exacerbated by his own shortcomings. Mayur shares great on-screen chemistry with his friends Meena and Uday, who are played by Ranjan Raj and Alam Khan, respectively. While everyone's performances are consistent, Raj's character, Meena, steals the show once again, especially when he is dealing with his adolescent hormones. His innocent one-liners infuse the show with the required humour.Ahsaas Channa, as the medical student Shivangi Ranawat, has a significant role in this season, assisting and serving as a support system for the group of students. Vartika, played by Revathi Pillai, has a minor role, but her on-screen chemistry with Vaibhav is endearing enough for audiences to remember.Like its predecessor, this season of 'Kota Factory' perfectly captures the students' vulnerability while also highlighting the burgeoning coaching industry, which views its students' victories as a marketing campaign for their institutes. Overall, the production is highly motivating, with a compelling story and outstanding performances that make this satire a must-watch."
tt0110912,"One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.""What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind."
tt0110912,I like the bit with the cheeseburger. It makes me want to go and get a cheeseburger
tt0110912,"This is Tarantino's masterpiece, there's no other way to say it. It has arguably one of the smartest scripts I've ever seen. The story, which is non-linear, is so well constructed it takes several viewings to grasp it all. The movie doesn't seem to be about any spesific thing, but there is a subtle hint of redemption as a central theme. The characters and preformances in this movie are practically perfect. This is still one of the best performances I've seen from Sam Jackson, and it's an outrage he didn't win an Oscar. Each scene has its own unique flavour and charm, every segment has its own arc while also tying into the main plot. The comedy is great, the serious moments are great, every word of dialogue is exciting despite seemingly not having any reason to exist. This movie is just such a great time, and I recommend it to everyone who loves movies. I cannot think of a single genuine flaw with it, and it will remain one of my favorite movies for a long time."
tt0110912,"I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines – it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of ""chapters"" – there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.If you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats – and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even ""stealing"" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's – well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
tt0110912,"Pulp Fiction is the most original, rule breaking film I have ever seen. Instead of following the widely used 3 act structure, Pulp Fiction makes up its own and while the 3 stories may seem completely disconnected at first, once you look closely you can find the underlying themes that they all share. Anyone who says that the movie lacks focus or has no meaning hasn't analysed enough. I highly recommend this film since it is number one on my list of my favourite movies of all time."
tt0110912,Before I saw this I assumed it was probably overrated. I was wrong. It lives up to and surpasses its reputation in pretty much every way. I would definitely recommend.
tt0110912,"To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will."
tt0110912,"I don't get as much out of Pulp Fiction as everybody else does. I don't like that it doesn't have a strong message, I think the dialogue goes on self-impressed tangents some times and the Mia Wallace story doesn't tie in with the rest of the film and it just isn't that interesting to me. However, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate its style. The entire film from the costume design, to the camera work, to the setting of LA are dripping with noir atmosphere. The writing, while it does jerk itself off at times, is still pretty memorable and enjoyable to listen to. The acting is fantastic all around, getting especially good performances from Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta and Bruce Willis.While I don't think its a masterpiece, it is something fun to watch if you're looking for something different and intriguing."
tt0110912,"My oh my.  ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of those roller-coasters of a movie.  It is both a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5."
tt0110912,I don't understand why this is the 8th highest rated movie of all time. I saw how highly rated it was so decided to watch it. After the first half an hour I found it enjoyable but my mind wasn't blown. As the movie continued I kept waiting for something to happen that warrants its 8.9 stars. Nothing actually happens in this movie. I hope its just me because through my eyes its the most overrated movie of all time.
tt0110912,"Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories that entertwine together around the world of Marcellus Wallace. Quentin Tarantino proves that he is the master of witty dialogue and a fast plot that doesn't allow the viewer a moment of boredom or rest. From the story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a date between a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss. There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected. The movie redefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John Travolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fan of film."
tt0110912,"Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it."
tt0110912,"This is my favorite film of all time. Every second of this film is engaging, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that. Tarantino's direction and script is brilliant, and every role is perfectly cast. Everything that happens in this movie has a purpose, and you don't realize it's hidden in plain sight until the final moments"
tt0110912,I heard so many people claim that this movie is a masterpiece and it also has high ratings. So I was intrigued to give it a go. I didn't get much enjoyment out of it. Maybe you have to watch it multiple times to enjoy it. As for the first viewing it didn't satisfy me.
tt0110912,"Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and maybe the best of the 90's. His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even though Rodriguez's was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage to the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. However, Pulp Fiction remains my favourite.It was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe that it only got one: Best original script. I'm not complaining because Forrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like Tarantino's or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much more.Anyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's finest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a ""tough guy"" image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest point.The other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations. ""And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger..."" is my favourite quote.Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10."
tt0110912,"I was tempted to stop watching it about four times. I went up to the end just to see if, at least, there is something extraordinary or unexpected there. I really can't understand what all these viewers found to this film, to score it so high. It's the first time (or the second I'm not sure!) that I get into the mood of writing a review. The reason, I guess, is because this film is the fifth in the top 250 ranking and I couldn't see why. The curiosity of the ranking was also the reason of watching it at the first place. There is a high end casting and a top level director but nothing more, IN MY OPINION. I tried looking it through the eyes of 1994 but still compared to other productions of the age is far behind. If you find yourself in the position wondering whether to watch this film or not, due to its place in the list don't waste your time!"
tt0110912,This movie is such a masterpiece for many reasons. The way everything connects makes it really important for you to pay attention. Lots of action and very funny. It also has a really good balance of everything you look for in a movie.
tt0110912,"Conflicted on this one. I like a lot of elements of it, the characters are (mostly) really compelling and interesting. I think some of the ""Segments"" are a lot stronger than others. I think that the first part of Bruce Willis's story is just... bland. I didn't find it very interesting or compelling. It gets interesting though. The first and last are by far my favourite, but for the most part it's pretty strong. I do think this film is slightly overrated. That's not to say that it isn't good, but I think a lot of people think it is a whole lot better then it is. The film is acted well and I enjoyed all the action, not to mention the comedy in this film caught me by surprise. I found it really hilarious. I see why everyone had/has a crush on Uma Thurman now, she really is deserving of the main character on the cover. I also remembered how much I like long shots. I think they allow exposition to be delivered in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. Overall, good crime flick with some great comedy and action but a tad overrated. 7-8/10."
tt0110912,"It's not a film it's a experience. The characters are very memorable The story of nonlinear dialogue and action no the whole movie is fast and fun there's no down time or anything boring the movie is long. There's more then 10 memorable scenes that is referenced in any type of media. I like to think of pulp fiction as resvoir dogs another film by the genius tarrintino as a better version of it. I thought resvoir dogs had the coffe scene at the start and mr white hurting the police officer. I thought the movie was stretched out more then it needed to and the ending gave me such a poor taste in my mouth. I still like it, like I would get a poster or t shirt of resvoir dogs to show my opinion. There did you see that I lost focus that's what pulp fiction does it makes you forget about the world but remember about the experience. The scene where butch reclaims himself in the eyes of walleces is a redemption story in itself about how we can all get together without fighting and being greedy. The part where 2 scenes ( tiny bit of a spoiler but watch Pulp fiction now if you haven't) where somehow at point blank range a revolver didn't shoot Jules and vincent and somehow Vincent shoots one of the guys in the head on accident. Thats a message life is like a box of chocolates the things you never expect will happen. Another part of the idea is the violence and sex violence plays a big part in this movie these are horrible people that everyone loves when I see this film I feel like it's a LEGO set controlled by tarrintino everything goes together like cause and effect yet while still being random sex is not that big in the film expect for the epic scene where butch remdeems himself and when butch is making out with his girlfriend but that scene was still great because he had to find his watch holy crap. This movie has dialogue lots of it and that's fantastic he is known for dialogue the tarrintino himself said that dialogue is a major component in his films and it shows, other films have such poopy dialogue where all they do is talk about nothing like get on with it. Pulp fiction is the story of 3 as 1 and should be hands down the number 1 film of the millennium ."
tt11989890,"Unbelievable, I have watched many documentaries over the years on natural history and climate change. But this is the nail in the coffin. The final hurrah. This should be shown in schools and so many more places for education. It's informative and really hits home on the challenges this world faces."
tt11989890,"I've always known the message this film pushes, I've known its the most crucial thing that currently or has ever existed, I know that people are eager to enable it to happen, but I also know at this rate it never will.Watching this made me cry. Not because it enlightened me to the reality of the issue but because it reminded me of the barbaric reality that is humanity. I want more than anything in the world for people to work solely on this issue to come as close to a solution as possible, and I Know writing this won't change anything. I'm not writing it for you. I'm writing it for me. From here forward I will be working to become a environmental engineer to perhaps come closer to the solution. and I know I'm just one person but as David Attenborough has demonstrated, as he has influenced me, it only takes one person to change the way another preserves or interacts with the environment creating a chain reaction that might just save what enables not only humans but EVERYTHING to exist."
tt11989890,"The saddest, yet most hopeful film I've ever seen. This man is not only a national hero, he is an hero for the whole world. Made me cry, but gave me hope. Sir David, your life works will be remembered with the likes of Einstein and Newton someday, you are just as big a genius in your field as they were in their own fields. You are inspiring me to become a better version of myself. Film of the year."

tt11989890,"I went to see this at my local cinema on Monday 28th of September the only day this movie was being shown in theatres (but is getting released on Netflix on October 4th) and it was breath taking, frightening but also beautiful as I knew it would be and more! I seriously wholeheartedly hope most people on this planet will watch this documentary and especially world leaders and government officials! Not to mention this documentary is just Incredibly educating and should be shown in schools eventually. There is zero excuse not to see this movie. ZERO! This is a MUST watch for everyone. Because we all call Earth our home and there is NO Planet B for us! There is NO denying the scientific evidence and vitally Important message this movie gives. If you deny it you are a stupid non intelligent human being who should NOT be allowed to be in charge and make big decisions on anything period! Wild Biodiversity MUST be protected at all costs for the future of humanity on Earth because by protecting it we protect ourselves as well as countless other wild animals and plants that we share this planet with!!! Please watch David Attenborough: A Life On Our Planet. I Implore everyone to!"
tt11989890,"Look at the name. Look at the man. The man is the greatest, and no one else can ever compare. Humanity literally peaked with him. The word ""legendary"" is actually defined as: ""Sir David Attenborough"". Just do it please."
tt11989890,"I just returned from the premiere of David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet, a documentary in which the man himself talks about how he witnessed many drastic changes that happened in our world during a single lifetime. As I was watching it, I often felt the need to look away, even though I knew that I would be closing my eyes to the harsh truth of our planet's decay if I did. My advice? Do not look away from this documentary for a second. It will show you seemingly irreversible damage done to this earth, but give you specific hope that'll make sure not all will be lost. It will show you that everything that has been destroyed can be rebuilt. My personal favorite part is where he shows us that this is not about saving our planet: it's about saving ourselves. Because if humanity perishes due to its own errors, life will start anew anyway. It's all about the legacy we leave behind that will determine whether our species becomes extinct... or gets to live another century to see the world rise from the ashes we created.All in all, a convincing documentary, not with necessarily lots of new visual content, but rather an incredibly moving, personal story beautifully tied together with video footage and fantastic music."
tt11989890,"This is David Attenborough most personal and most hard hitting documentary to date!Rather than focusing on just the natural wonders of the world, the legendary presenter reflects on his career and highlights how the environment and natural world has changed during its course.The impact of his stern words are heightened when you see the facts that support what he is saying. However at many points whilst what he is saying and explaining is quite frankly horrifying, it's not all doom and gloom.In his unique way, he outlines some of the routes we can take to reverse the damage mankind doing, and return the natural world to a balanced and abundant position, which is nothing if not motivating / uplifting.As he mentions, this is his witness statement, and never had a message from someone so important been so needed.As he explains we have ravaged the natural world with impunity, but in order to save ourselves, we need to address and restore the naturals worlds balance.Hopefully many people will be as inspired and awakened as I was when watching this."
tt11989890,"David Attenborough, one of very few you can hold in as high regard as Gandhi or MLK, calmly and clearly enunciates his experiences throughout his 94 years, bearing witness to the carnage, the chaos and the destruction wrought by the populations of this world on the oceans, the landscapes and all the lifeforms we inhabit and share our planet with. He presents us with a pathway to recovery, a way to repair, to make amends. No histrionics or melodrama, a simple message, of learning a lesson, of reparation and recovery, of sustainability, longevity and perpetuity.If, like most, it's a story and message you're familiar with, make today the first day of the rest or your life - go for it, start making the changes the future yous need you to make, to save their world, the flora and fauna, from the imminency of self inflicted mass extinction, holocaust, genocide and Armageddon. Make today the day that you decide to change your world and, by doing so, help to re-establish and rebalance the scales of nature that have been so biased and skewed by the sinister and greedy enterprises of fossil fuels, inorganic mammal and poultry production, these manufacturers and machines of chaos - make a difference today, make a difference tomorrow but above all make a difference while you still have the chance to make that difference, and a chance to make that difference count!"
tt11989890,"A final plea from the godfather of natural history and the greatest broadcaster of our time, David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet chronicles the life & career of the extraordinary figure who's best known for presenting & narrating some of the greatest nature documentaries ever made, and is unparalleled for his contribution to educating the masses about Earth's natural & wildlife wonders, and the need to preserve it in the wake of mankind's utter disregard & reckless destruction of each n every habitat.Directed by the crew that's been instrumental in echoing Attenborough's soothing & eloquent voice all over the world, this is a documentary of immediate relevance & urgency that serves as his personal witness statement for the natural world and future generation. Through his own first-hand account, he acquaints the audience with the overall decline of our planet's wildlife reserves and what the future holds if human exploits are allowed to continue at the alarming rate they already are at, and it sure doesn't look good.Still, Attenborough is hopeful that we can turn things around if we act swiftly and even offers solutions to restore & stabilise our planet's biodiversity. It's gonna take a collective effort from people all over the world to reverse the damage and avoid the grim & devastating fate that awaits ahead. It will take an unprecedented level of international cooperation & collaboration to address the unprecedented global crisis that we face today yet what makes it depressing is the brutal realisation that it's probably too late and we are already past the point of no return.As often is the case with the documentaries Attenborough has presented over the years, this film itself is gorgeously photographed and is interspersed with footage of his own time in the wild in order to draw comparison to the decline ecosystems have undergone over the years. And the difference is not only obvious but it's also extremely unsettling. Attenborough himself is just as graceful as he's always been in his presentation, with a genuine concern for the increasing rate at which we are depleting the natural resources and signing our own death certificate.Overall, David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet is another masterfully crafted documentary of bracing impact & immediacy that finds its 93-year old naturalist taking the centerstage to remind us of our role & responsibility to mother nature and how our actions can ensure the survival of not only our species but all life on Earth. Compared to the extensively detailed nature documentaries he has been a part of, this one does seem brief at mere 83 mins but it captures a more personal side of the man who has seen more of the natural world than any other, and is by all means an essential viewing."
tt11989890,"Let me say first, I LOVE David Attenborough, and I love that he fights for nature and wants to make a point even at his rip golden age of 90+. The footage he shows is brilliant and mostly new (due to being on Netflix I suppose). The biggest flaw in this new installment of ""let's save the planet"" is that his view on how humans will turn the corner and not face extinction is entirely flawed.First we start with slashing forests down for more cattle and coffee plantations - that's not going to stop. Costa Rica is a bad example and even if they were a great example, Brazil will never stop it, Indonesia will never stop it, they prefer to grow tobacco instead of having some ""useless"" trees. In the end, the government wants money, the people want to earn money, not look at trees and live like hippies around them. Which is actually the problem with most of David's ideas - the governments, the corporations, they will not follow! Nature can recover, we've seen that not only in Costa Rica but also in Malaysia where they created a ""fake"" rainforest to see if it would turn out the same, and I don't need to go to Chernobyl 40 years after the disaster to check if nature takes back the space - I can see that in my garden after just half a year of neglect. Mr. Attenborough, nobody wants to go to Chernobyl because it's radioactive, but you cannot assume that people would leave alone free land in e.g. Oregon, for nature to grow a forest if it could be used for agriculture or new housing developments instead. That's not how our society works.Fishing is the WORST solution he provided, enabling no-fish zones to provide spill-over to fishing. The example he made was PALAU of all places. Fact is that Palau receives almost all of their food from the US - Hawaii if I'm not mistaken - by boat. Once the boat didn't come for a month and they all didn't have vegetables for that time period. The locals all live on welfare rather than farming on their own and they all burn their trash to cause more harm to the environment. The fisherman in the documentary throws a tiny net out to catch his fish - that's not the problem anyway - it's a huge Chinese vessel coming along, ignoring any kind of no-fish zones (Palau, Tonga, Galapagos, Antarctica just to name a FEW examples, they are everywhere and will NOT stop!) and the poor fish are all gone. You cannot have this working if rogue nations like China and to many extend Japan just fish whatever and wherever they want.Overpopulation, Mr. Attenborough, may peak soon but that's not because of society educating young women or family planning - it will be because there is no food, no space, no health care system to care for all of it. His example, a horrible one again, is that Japan stopped having babies! Well, that's their attitude, a lot of women work and don't want children, true, but they are also facing a disaster of no young generation to fill the gaps in the pyramid. Is every nation going to be like Japan? No, Europe has parts of their populating declining but that's mainly because of family planning and understanding that you don't want to have 3-4-5 children anymore. China's controversial one-child policy may actually have worked to level the population growth but I suppose nobody wants to talk about that. Does the rest of the world follow? No. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, they still have a huge amount of kids. Religious believes, no access to family planning, contribute to an oncoming disaster. Let's face it, the Catholic Church banning contraceptives is medieval.The elephant in the room is that politics and corporate greed will always destroy our planet rather than individuals. We can recycle our trash as much as we want but BP oil spills are worst than us not having recycled our entire life. Brazil says they cannot control the Amazon burning down - I'm sure the plantation owners are happy to see new land becoming available for more cattle that make your burgers (which is horrible again because cows cause more harm to the environment than humans due to constantly belching methane, so do your part and switch to chicken meat).Lastly, people are selfish and greedy too - let's not lie about it. Maybe you personally reading this are a kind soul, bless you, but there are enough individuals who seek opportunities to gain money, spread their seeds, exploit nature if necessary. That's going to take a lot of effort, and David is maybe trying to reach us for this point but I think he definitely failed in his approach. New York will be cleaner when we switch to renewable energy? Let's hope so!"
tt11989890,"I was waiting in anticipation to watch this documentary. I am an Attenborough fan and have watched all his documentaries. Because I admire his work I placed my expectations high. I just wish it had said more, encouraged more, targeted some key areas of development in a specific manner.
The documentary is a rushed account of our current state. The focus, I felt, from the trailers would be on solutions. But it swiftly moves through to meet a time limit.
That renders it superficial. What it presents is common knowledge. Great visuals as usual though. I expected it to be insightful. Empowering individuals with the courage to act and showing them how. Clearly Specifically targeting Industries like fashion, food, the luxury cruise are imperative in the discussion of climate change and behavioural changes that are necessary to bring about this shift. Promoting conscious consumerism to individuals is essential for the well-being of the planet. It merely scratched the surface.
Generic and broad comments avoided targeting specific corporations and governments. A more courageous work would have been groundbreaking. The powerful need to be convinced and coerced into adapting ways that promote a positive impact.
A voice and persona like Attenborough could have made a grand impact. I felt that was sorely missed."
tt11989890,"This film is astonishing. It serves as a greatest hits of Attenborough's career, featuring some of the greatest wilderness shots ever put on camera. It doubles as a powerful statement about the direction we've taken our planet, and examines the choices the human species has to make. I've never felt such awe, sadness and hope in the space of minutes, or sometimes simultaneously.
This is Attenborough's most powerful film because it examines the very essence of humanity, and our unbreakable relationship with the world he has spent his life researching. A must watch"
tt11989890,Really powerfull message for everybody on this planet! This film should be obligated for all the kids and adults. Rewild the world!
tt11989890,"This will be different from my other reviews, no pros or cons...You all just HAVE TO SEE THIS.All I can say is thank god for Sir David AttenboroughLets start helping future generations, wildlifeQuote - ""if we help nature then nature will help us"" - Sir DavidRating - 5/5"
tt11989890,You can always expect a few climate change warnings in all Attenborough documentaries however this one is our FINAL warning that comes with instructions on how to fix it! Every human being should watch this and use this as an a roadmap for sustainable living NOW!!!
tt11989890,Masterpiece. If this movie doesn't change our minds and actions nothing will.
tt11989890,"This is my first review, ever. There is no debating this. This is a must see for every capable human being."
tt11989890,"David Attenborough is a personal hero of mine and I must admit I've never seen him like this. I've known for a long time that we're destroying our planet and ive lived in ignorance. This documentary made me want to change and do more.I can't help but feel like this was all very final and Attenborough is saying goodbye though, as if to say it's over to us now.Please watch it, it's an extremely important message from a national treasure."
tt11989890,"There still is hope for our planet, but we need to realize that we need to adapt and change with the planet or for the planet.This movie is a good way to learn how we can adapt and help ourself and the planet"
tt11989890,"This needs to be shown to the whole world. What an incredible piece of television and education. It is often sad, especially as it feels it could possibly be one of his last pieces of TV, if not the last. This needs to be watched by everyone."
tt11989890,"You want to stop the destruction of our natural world but don't mention the fact that 100 companies create 71% of the worlds emissions.
Capitalism encourages the destruction of the natural world and the unregulated hoarding of resources.
For me the change we need to see has to come from the top, and it's a shame David didn't pursue this argument more.
That being said, everyone can and should do what they can to help, but it won't be enough if the most powerful in this world don't make the changes they need to."
tt11989890,"I truly respect and love sir Attenborough. First half of the movie was excellent. Second was not. Lecturing on obvious things and ignoring politics is ridiculous. Live by your means dear dutch, english or mumbaican and don't ask for Brasil, Ukraine or Norway to feed you. And yes we have short intestines, canine teeth and large brains. Eat brocoli and see what happened to some unfortunate castaway people in the last 3 millennia India."
tt0281491,"We just ""discovered"" this show on NetFlix two weeks ago and we are addicted to it! We have watched all the episodes on NetFlix and are watching them all again already. (Thank goodness for the subtitles because some of the slang we can't understand, haha.) Great actors, clever scripts, so funny! We just LOVE Victor, Jack and Winston!! This show is unique because it's funny and has genuine ""heart"". The cast is top notch and we truly care about them so when Jack is missing his wife or Jack and Victor go to visit Winston in his awful new apartment out of town, the viewers really care about these characters in their sad situations (this proves what great actors they are). There are too many great episodes to pick a favorite! So many lines from this hilarious TV series have crept into our every day language, like ""cheery-bye"" (haha). We love how they make reference to many famous American entertainers that we love (like Perry Como, Jack Lord, ""Quincy,"" Abbott & Costello, etc.) We are so excited to hear that they are filming a new season this summer although we don't know how long it will be until American viewers can see them. Unfortunately, we can't find the series on Region 1 or 0 even though we would love to own them on DVD. We love, love, love ""Still Game""! Thanks, NetFlix, for bringing this amazingly clever, creative, fun, unique show to American viewers! (This show is funnier than any new American TV shows/movies!)"
tt0281491,"I found this on Netflix. I've always loved the humor of Ireland and Scotland and figured, eh, I'll watch an episode or two. 13 were available (seasons 4 and 5) and I watched every one and laughed like hell. OK, I admit there were times I wasn't sure just what was being said, but even when I missed a joke (accent or local reference) I still laughed. It's that good.If you want to have a summary of what this show is about, there are loads of places for that, but this is a review, not a summary so, no summary.The lead actors are just amazing and can do deadpan so well, it seems like they're really just engaging each other, we're looking in on real people in their normal every day lives and, like every day life can be, we laugh.There are occasionally poignant moments, but they seem almost like a tease, the humor is right there to push you back and say, ""Oh come now, this IS a comedy after all."" One side note, in the episode where the boys take the tour of the distillery, I could identify. My son and I took a tour of a brewery and were actually more interested in getting to the tasting room than how it's made. These guys took the idea of 'revisiting' to a whole new, hysterically funny level.Worth every second, even if some of the dialogue slips by, sometimes if you just take what was said, figure in the goings on, you still get the joke, and it's still funny.C'mon Netflix, bring on all those earlier seasons and let me enjoy every moment.I had to amend my review and THANK Netflix for putting the first three season into the mix. I'm dancing through the heather with joy. Plus I have to add something that I neglected to put in the first time around, the supporting cast is as wonderful as the leads (though they have the edge of being the stars) and each one's little quirk and eccentricity makes them all the more fun to watch. Enjoy, ya bastards! hee hee hee."
tt0281491,"Back in the days NBC's ""Golden Girls"" pioneered in discovering a fresh comedic potential according to the premise: Pensioners are also entitled to some post-prime fun before a career-move that involves pushing up the daisies. Especially when they're operating from Miami, Florida, of course. Now picture this as good old Sophia would say: How about we give the whole retiree idea more edge, relocate the girls to Scotland (complete with heavy accent), change their gender and language to something way stronger and offensive (yet in its own way endearing), and replace the picturesque Miami-scenario with fictional ""shitehole"" Craiglang ""somewhere near Glasgow"" with prospects being hee-haw as a Scot would say. You'll see: The fun refuses to concede defeat. Quite to the contrary. Welcome to ""Still Game""!Spun off from Ford Kiernan's and Greg Hemphil's sketch show ""Chewin' the Fat"", ""Still Game"" features strong 70+ characters ranging from the comedic widower duo Jack and Victor (Kiernan/Hemphil) over curmudgeon Winston, blabbermouth Isa and tight-arsed Tam to Indian-born shop owner Navid, who sports a rare talent for one-liners of the side-splitting kind. Now pleasures may be limited for old duffers, but life goes on and as such revolves around the local waterhole ""The Clansman"", the bookies, and the grocer's, with Isa's rumor mill working incessantly. Romance is a mere footnote. In that sense ""Still Game"" is not that far off the mark as real old geezers go. But in Craiglang there's a bright side to the shadow of old age: Death for example is a constant companion, accepted and dealt with in creative fashion (two words: hypothermia sweepstakes), and in the meantime as far as shaping the rest of one's life is concerned: disaster, small or large, is always around the corner. ""Still Game"", while out-and-out hilarious, occasionally dark-humored and sometimes over-the-top in a memorable way, also has its powerful dramatic moments. Character developments feel palpable and add another layer to the show and depth one wouldn't want to miss. The nine year long pause between season 6 and 7 is hardly noticeable. Following popular demand, ""Still Game"" is back again, as stand-up comedy and sitcom. So brush up on your Scottish, or turn on the subtitles. You don't want to miss this."
tt0281491,"Still Game is fantastic - taking on board some of the other peoples comments - the humour has been crude at times, and you could see some things coming - but the best thing about it is that a joke comes completely out of the blue (eg. Series 3 Ep1 with the tacky souvenirs and the ""Canadian Beaver"" t-shirt).Either way, it's worth a shot. Like many TV programs, it may take a few episodes to get into. In Scotland this series has been highly popular in the ratings, but not shown Nationwide in the UK. There is some talk about toning down the language - It is a disgrace trying to change it, as this is a representation of part of Scottish culture. If we apply the BBC's attitude to Still Game to other comedies then Only Fools and Horses would have contained no Cockney Rhyming Slang (and no where near as funny as it actually is)One interesting thing noted is that as a series it appears to be taking a leaf from ""The Simpsons"" and branching out with many supporting characters who appear from time to time. I think this is keeping the series fresh.For those brave enough to visit where the series is filmed - you'll no be able to get a pint down the Clansman - as the pub you see from the outside was knocked down sometime between April and May 04.Like most of the other comments about this show - I would recommend this to anyone."
tt0281491,"I have noticed that a few other reviews have been commenting on how people south of the border (the English) will not relate too or understand this Scottish comedy? However I am an Englishman living on the south coast of England (which is probably as far south as you can get from Scotland on mainland Britain) and I am an absolute Still Game fanatic! I have been brought up on virtually all of the British gems of the comedy world i.e Only Fools & Horses, Men behaving badly, Open all Hours, Porridge e.t.c so I was therefore a little surprised and sceptical when my best mate recommended a Scottish comedy called Still Game which hardly anyone in England had heard of, including me. One episode later and I was hooked! For me Still Game in terms of humour was not worlds apart from virtually all the other British Comedies whether they originated from the South or North of the border, I could personally see elements of humour & comedy that could appeal to fans of 'Only Fools & Horses' right the way through to fans of 'Men behaving badly' and all the other comedies in between.Next to the humour, the acting is superb with clever story lines and quotes that define it as a true gem. I only wish I could have followed this sitcom from the very beginning but unfortunately for some reason or another Still Game was never aired on English primetime TV (which seemed a bit stupid seeing as how England accounts for most of the BBC's viewers)."
tt0281491,Watched it thousands of times. Watch it every night before bed and still laugh every time. Excellent comedy.
tt0281491,"I think it is important to begin by stating that I was dubious about any show made since the influence of American television on the British Isles. But this is Scottish! Perhaps the independence of Scottish spirit buttresses their humour against the negative influence of U.S. productions. The writing is brilliant in the sense that, unlike American TV, little, if any, is predictable. The timing is spot on and the laugh tracks are in sync with the punchlines instead of used as a constant background. Witty is the best one word description I could use to entice others to give the show a chance. The visual expressions combine with subtlety to present the kind of humour I thought was lost on television. Sit back, put your feet up and enjoy television, once again."
tt0281491,"Ok first the accent is thick but it's perfect. The funny thing is the caption are not corrected English but how it's said. So you get cannea, Boabby, Disney, our etc. That's just the icing on this Scottish cake. The situations are so damn funny. The characters are so real but the humor is genius, cheeky , kinda adult but still familyish. All I will say is make it your go to show. Tytyty Netflix."
tt0281491,"Still Game is an absolute little gem of a comedy taking Victor and Jack from their sketch's in 'Chewin the Fat'into the wider world of fictional Glasgow scheme estate Craigland.Victor and Jack are two elderly widowed gentlemen living in a grim world of scraping by on their pensions trying to keep warm in their high storey flats. But they make sure they make the most of their situation and it's pretty inspirational stuff.The best laughs come from the other characters, crafty Winston, gossip Isa, shopkeep Naveed, barman Boaby etc, plenty of good story lines and sharp put downs make for the type of show where if you buy the DVD you watch one episode and keep on until the end, then go out and buy the another series Sadly on the network the BBC has seen fit to screen only a select few episodes. Okay the accents and certain jokes/references require a knowledge of Scottish culture/dialect but like Rab C Nesbitt the comedy is strong enough to shine through.The laughs are often dark, and set amongst the bleak black drops of old age, poverty, crime, loneliness you name it! But like say 'One foot in the Grave' it is adept at handling serious situations then bringing us back to the comedy with just one hot line. For a spot of spirit in adversity look no further."
tt0281491,Great chemistry between characters and it reminds me of a better time! I wish my grandfather was alive to watch this with me.I feel like it will be timeless and approachable by all. Incredible writing. It gets a little wackier towards the ends but still highly entertaining. I do love the earlier seasons. I am not scottish and love the accents and the concept. Showing our elderly as playful and young minded. On of my all time favorite shows.Usually a show only has one or two favorite characters. This show its hard to decide because tam and winston are hilarious and so are jack and victor. Bobby the bartender plays the fool brilliantly. A ttue gem.
tt0281491,A great antidote to a pandemic. For us Americans: closed captions required.
tt0281491,"Having 'found' Still Game on BBC2 a couple of years ago it has consistently delivered great comedy. I was fortunate enough to be given the Series 1-5 on DVD at Christmas which has brought the opportunity to view the 'Scotland only' episodes. So many things explained..so many laughs I would not have had!As for criticism of the accents / language etc. - it's nae for wee bairns noo.. Put the subtitles on or roll back the DVD scene. Easy. Like all good comedy programmes, Still Game has the power to engage its audience in taking them on an emotional journey ranging from sadness to hilarity - as evidenced in Jack and Victor's trip to Canada followed by the gift review at The Clansman. Good writing that has improved as the characters develop (check out the early episodes of 'The Fast Show' and see how their characters do the same). Most episodes have the ability to make me laugh out loud. Sadly, I'm now at the end of Series 6 so have to wait and see whether there will be Series 7.. Just don't kill Jack or Victor yet please. They may be old but they're definitely Still Game!"
tt0281491,"I am perhaps lucky that I grew up, and live near to where the show is based, Glasgow. So I have no issues with the accent and pretty much that is the way many around this area speak.
My only gripe is the overuse of swear words, to try and get a cheap laugh. Not necessary guys the show is funny enough without that.
After a slowish start, as with most sitcoms, as we get to know the characters, the show is on a steep incline in terms of laughs and quality. First 6 seasons are very good and as good a comedy as you get anywhere.
The 2 main actors had a bit of falling out, I believe, which is why there is a big gap between season 6 and 7. They patched up their differences, had huge sell out tours in 2014 and brought back the show in 2016.
There are some decent episodes in season 7, 8 and 9 but generally the quality took a nose dive, like many sitcoms that outstayed their welcome
Last episode is very poignant, which leaves the viewers to decide for themselves the ending,
Some memorable characters, Naveed, and his wife, Isa, Tam and Winston"
tt0281491,"It was like Last of the Summer Wine, how people find it that funny is surprising, especially a British sitcom. Would class it as lighthearted entertainment."
tt0281491,"The fourth series of Still Game recently finished on BBC2. This was the first time it had been shown nationwide and, thankfully, the unthinkable didn't happen. The slang. the swearing, the banter and the accents were all present and correct. You've got to hand it to the BBC for choosing not to tone down the dialect, if they'd been allowed to anglicise Still Game it just wouldn't be the same. I recently met the show's creators Ford Kiernon and Greg Hemphill at a book-signing and when they were quizzed over the possibility of Still Game being toned down, Kiernon replied, ""Naw, they can get it up them!"". Rapturous applause followed.You wouldn't think this programme was now in its fourth series, it still feels as sharp and fresh as it did back in 2002. While most programmes, like Ford and Greg's own Chewin' The Fat for example, tend to go downhill after a couple of runs, Still Game seems to improve with each series. Admittedly most of the laughs consist of old people swearing at each other but the excellent cast deliver their put-downs with gusto. The two leads, Kiernon in particular, make very convincing pensioners; little touches like shuffling slightly and muttering under their breath work well.The supporting cast are excellent as well. Jane McCarry, who plays ""nosey old cow"" Isa, sounds frighteningly like an old woman and her double act with Paul Riley's Winston is uproarious. Gavin Mitchell as Bobby the barman and Mark Cox as tight-fisted Tam are also excellent. But the absolute standout is Sanjeev Kohli as the acid-tongued shopkeeper Navid, Still Game's ultimate scene-stealer. Scottish dialect delivered in an Indian accent is funny in a way you've never heard and his horrific remarks to his wife Mena (whose face is always hidden) are comedy gold.Along with being consistently hilarious, Still Game is occasionally very touching; Jack memories of his late wife and Victor's strained relationship with his son are bring a real pathos and humanity to the proceedings. These moments are quiet and understated, giving Still Game a maturity that Chewin' The Fat lacked.Whether or not the folks down south got it or not is still unclear, some dreadful reviews would suggest not, but who gives a toss as Scotland once again has a sitcom it can really be proud of. Easily a match for Rab C Nesbitt, Still Game is a hilarious, bittersweet and thoughtful look at life through the eyes of the elderly - and a real celebration of Scottish, particularly Glasgow, culture. Long live Still Game!"
tt0281491,"The following is NOT meant as an insult to anyone: Most Americans seem to have difficulty understanding strong Scottish accents. And, I assume, most Scots have a hard time understanding us. That being said, despite the difficulties, I enjoyed watching re-runs of ""Still Game"" on Netflix even though it was occasionally difficult following what they were saying. Fortunately, Netflix IS captioning the program now and it really helps with my enjoyment of this cute series.The show centers on two Scotsmen who are roommates. Neither wants to grow old gracefully and both have a variety of strange friends who they associate with...including some they don't even like! In many ways, the show SEEMS slow and mundane but keep watching. Like the wonderful Canadian show, ""Corner Gas"", the seemingly mundane becomes very enjoyable and you really grow to love the characters and weird situations they've gotten themselves into. Overall, ""Still Game"" is a marvelous show...full of wit and cleverness."
tt0281491,"Since discovering this series not all that long ago, I think I watched it three times! Each time it gets better <3 Great stories - some hilarious, some poignant - endearing characters. What more can an audience ask for? I don't watch comedies often because they're quite honestly don't as a rule make me laugh, but I get a lots of laughs out of this one! I just love the show and send out a thanks to the creators !"
tt0281491,"Started watching the show my expectations were not too high but boy was I wrong.I've only just finished the final season and I miss Jack & Victor already along with the other characters of Craiglang.What a great show, hilariously funny ...."
tt0281491,"Still Game is a television comedy that I stumbled, upon purely by accident while programme skimming on Netflix.I quickly became hooked by the humorous banter of the characters, this was a new world to me especially as I have no knowledge of its antecedents.It is very broad Scots and I can quite see, how many viewers can be put off by that, but then I am not a novice at Scottish humour.My introduction to it was way back in the days of the TV show the White Heather Club, which used to be seen on our TV screens south of the border around Hogmanay.For me this was very much a mixed blessing especially what passed for humour, the least said about that the better as personally it was dire.It wasn't until the broadcast of the telly show Naked Video, that I really started to take any notice at all. That led to the frankly seminal Rab C. Nesbitt, we'd been prepared for it as Rab and Mary's characters had been trailed in Naked Video.This show for me sets the scenario for Still Game, with similar neighbourhoods, bottom of the barrel characters, situations and lives.When my son Jamie first saw Still Game he immediately pinpointed something that I had ignored, that these were merely youngish blokes, simply camouflaged as older codgers.While I freely admit that is the case I prefer to, ignore that and concentrate on the comedy, character banter, and the hilarity of the yes, often absurd but still very funny, situations that the characters become immersed in.There is often strong language used between them, but this is one of shared experience, and genuine attitudes and feelings, between people who have to, let's face it effectively sink or swim in the same surroundings.I can appreciate Still Game more now because I am, of the similar age group as Jack and Victor at 74.They are a great cross section of humanity having to, survive in this small community of Craigland, all of whom are deftly drawn by the brilliantly observed character acting."
tt0281491,"There are some mixed opinions i see, and i guess thats what its all about. However firstly may i add that this series is massive North of the border and you do need a Scottish sense of humour to really enjoy this. I can't see the English enjoying this at all since either side of the border differ greatly on tastes. The 1st series was outstanding, the 2nd not quite as good but still up providing plenty of laughs. The 3rd has just finished and i have to say it was fantastic! You really won't get this if you need it translated south of the border and i hope they don't decide to screen it in England as BBC Scotland has been told they must tone down the Scottish slang if they do.Its a fantastic outlook on how poor weegie OAP's go about their daily routine, still thinking they are in their 20's, quite simply a breath of fresh air from the traditional American and English comediesBring on series 4 lads!"
tt0281491,"Netflix analytics was certain I'd like Still Game. I resisted for a while but eventually succumbed and I'm very pleased I did.I've now watched all 9 seasons twice. The second viewing was made even more enjoyable with the knowledge that Boaby (which, on the face of it, is a Glaswegian pronunciation of Bobby) has a slang meaning ;-)I recommend giving this series a chance. It just gets better and better. The cast are a delight.Greg and Ford say that there will be no more episodes with the original cast. I've read talk of a prequel. To be honest, I will be watching whatever they produce next."
tt0281491,Best thing which can happen to you.lots of love.Thank you.
tt0281491,"Still Game is undoubtedly the comedy highlight of the week.I don't understand why I keep reading comments that you have to be Scottish to 'get' this with some people even claiming they're unable to understand the dialogue, which I think says rather more about them...If you enjoy good acting, fantastic characters (every one of them capable of stealing a scene) and rollicking good story lines then you can't fail to enjoy Still Game whether you're Scottish, English, Welsh, Irish or Martian.Hemphill and Kiernan have produced an understated and undervalued masterpiece. It's a disgrace that the first few series were not shown nationwide and with all the channels at their disposal is it too much to ask that the BBC repeat them in an attempt to get this series the credit it deserves?"
tt0281491,"One of the least funny things I've ever seen. I've honestly got no idea how so many people rate this so highly. There must be something I'm missing, but I've no idea what it is.Maybe it's because I'm a Londoner; this one is best left to Northerners and Scots I guess. Very bizarre."
tt0108778,I never used to watch this show. My wife loved this show and whenever she would watch it I would never pay attention because I had no interest in it. But then one day I happen to look up and see something funny and I got hooked. Out of all the characters on this show the one I can relate to the most was Chandler.I started watching all the reruns with my wife all the time on TBS. But after my wife passed away in September of last year I just can't bring myself to watch the show. All I have to say is the show is definitely worth watching and it was sad to see it go.Thank you Matthew for making me and my wife laugh. Rest in peace.
tt0108778,"I must've have rewatched these 10 series dozens of times since it first aired.After hearing the devastating news this morning that Matthew Perry had passed away, I'm watching it with a new pair of slightly sadder eyes.'Friends' got me through a sad and difficult childhood. Sitting down to watch the new episodes at 9pm every Friday on channel 4, was one of the only things I can remember my family did together with no arguments.First watched as a 12 year old, not getting most of the jokes, but laughing (mostly at Chandler!) all the way through each episode ....and now watching as a 40 year old, understanding far too well all the troubles of love and work, and life and friendship.What a brilliant show."
tt0108778,"What can be said about Friends that hasn't already been said? It's easily one of the best sitcoms of all-time. It's on every ""best sitcoms ever"" list for a reason...because it is! If that doesn't convince you just read through these reviews and you'll see just how loved this show really is. The cast is perfect, not a weak link on the entire show. Almost everyone can find someone on the show that they identify with. I've seen every episode numerous times (considering it's always on) and I still laugh just as much on every watch as I did the first time I watched it. I'll continue to watch reruns and laugh and I doubt that I'll ever get bored with this show."
tt0108778,"I still love Friends as much now as an adult than I did when it was originally on 25 years ago when I was still a kid. It's just one of those all-time great sitcoms that are just as funny watching reruns as it was watching for the first time. You can probably tell it's still a very popular show even 25 years later by it always being on. Seriously, so many channels run the reruns that you can almost find it on anytime throughout the day. Not many shows hold up and are just as funny today as they were 20+ years ago but Friends is absolutely one of those shows. All six main characters are almost equally as funny. This truly is one of the best comedies that has ever been made."
tt0108778,"Are you happy? watch Friends!
are you sad? watch Friends!
not sure! yet, watch Friends!"
tt0108778,"There never has been a sitcom that truly pictures life among the  singles (twenty-something) as good as this show does. It's not just comedy, it presents the episodes  in such a way that one can truly identify with the situations they face so the audience has something to talk about in coffee shops too.  The humor is universal.  I feel like I'm part of the group every time I watch it because I feel the different emotions they go through. Plus, of course, it is so much fun because it's fast-paced.  Every scene and every moment is relative to what is going to happen next so you don't feel like it is dragging you onto nothing.  Just like how a sitcom should be. Funny!"
tt0108778,"'Friends' is simply the best series ever aired. The acting is amazing; after watching a few episodes you stop referring to the actors by their real names altogether, even if they appear in another movie. The characters are addictive, none are completely positive or negative. It would be quite easy to get along with or to be very annoyed by any of them in real life. Yet, all of them together (or even divided in groups) create this amazing chemistry that most people desire and few lucky ones have. The humor is wonderful, no matter what type of humor you like, you will get to a point where you will find at least something absolutely hilarious. There is slapstick, some light humor, some dark humor, some raunchiness, some cheesiness - a little bit of everything. The story is captivating; viewers keep coming back to see what situation fate (being the writers) puts the characters in today. It is truly a television masterpiece.There are, however, many people who scoff at the mentioning of 'Friends'. My guess is they've never seen or paid attention to the show. It's easy to discard something because ""everyone likes it"" and be ""unique"", when in reality the uniqueness is actually bias. Just watch a few episodes with before making any judgements - chances are you'll fall in love with it too. I would have serious doubts about one's sense of humor if I heard that they hated 'Friends'."
tt0108778,"Okay, so i watched friends 3 4 years ago and now it has become a daily part of my life. Im engineering student so i often come home exhausted from uni and watch friends with my sister all day to relax . I love the show the characters make me laugh and i forget my worries. A lot of people have complaints about the show saying it doesnt having enough POC characters and being unfunny? As POC i literally have no problem with the show's lack of POC characters honestly, i mean it doesnt bother me that much and i agree Seinfeld has better jokes than friends but it doesnt mean that friends isnt funny, its different and simple and flawed and that what makes the show so good to watch. A lot of people watch friends to learn english too so its fun. Not everything has to be ""woke"" and a masterpiece for people to enjoy and cherish and please do not forget the show came out in 90s and back then creators didnt focus that much about different agendas."
tt0108778,"The series aged like fine wine. I finished this whole series within a month like 236 episodes or more like 78 hours of content, that's how much interesting this series is. Some cliff hangers at the end of seasons is very suspenseful that i couldn't wait to watch the next season. Joey, Phoebe, Chandler, Monica, Ross & Rachel we like my friends by the end of the series. The comedic timing and all the funny elements of the show is on point. And the most important fact is that after finishing the series we could just start the series all over again and feel fresh. It has an immense amount of repeat value that we wouldn't get bored even after watching several times. I could go on for pages but the memes, the sitcom references, the stars the show created all speak form them selves."
tt0108778,"I cannot remember the amount of times I've sat down and thought ""I want to watch a new series on Netflix and start a new film!"" And after 5 minutes of watching something new I thought, why bother?!? And switch over to watching friends 😂 easy to watch, great comedy and full of content that's completely original. The more I watch it the more I learn about the characters I grew up with, and how I would respond to certain situations, with or without the overhead laughter in the background. I don't know a single person that hasn't seen this, so if your one of them reading my review, do yourself a favour and grab a glass of wine, or whatever, and prepare for back to back television greatness.
Thank you ""Friends"""
tt0108778,I won't lie when I say I'm probably one of the people who think this show is not funny. This has been recommended to me multiple times before I actually did give it a try. The first episode was meh but I kept watching until I found myself actually loving this show and it's really good and super chill. I think you actually have to know the characters more for you to appreciate their humor. This show is one of my go-to's when I'm feeling so down. Friends is so overrated and is always in most people's recommendations that you just keep on scrolling past through the list but seriously it's a good show and worth giving a shot!
tt0108778,"I have never watched something so unfunny, fake and weird. I wanted to see what the hype was about and didn't stop watching it even when I thought that it can't get any worse. I saw all the seasons because everyone kept saying that it will get better. Well, it didn't. The characters are so fake (especially Joey). For the longest time I believed that I just didn't like sitcoms before I found some other shows that were actually interesting and in which the story was developing not only during the first two and the last two episodes of the season. Honestly, I don't get it. I sincerely do not understand why this show is so popular even today when we truly have some really good series and sitcoms."
tt0108778,"To these days I can't figure out what made this average sitcom to be so especial for people. The best conclusion I could reach is that this show served for escapism to the real issues that American people where suffering in those days.Perhaps by seeing that those characters could overcome topics such as: divorce, infidelity, sexual inclinations, obsession etc, with a smile on their faces, real people in a way, could deal with that issues in that way. However, ""Friends"" was a fictional show, much of what it happened, albeit taken from reality, was dealt in a light-hearted way.To sum up, although the premise was interesting (six friends living together in New York), the development of the plot and characters could have been a bit more realistic."
tt0108778,"Everyone says that Seinfield is the greatest show ever. I love Seinfield but it doesn't come close to Friends. Every episode of Friends will make you laugh non-stop. We have grown to love the characters and what happens to them. The fitting personalities of these characters are absolute genius. Rachel the spoiled yet sweet girl, Monica the mother figure, Phoebe the hippy chick, Joey the dopey yet cool Italian, Chandler the sarcastic loser and Ross the neurotic victim stay together to help each other with their problems in the big city. I've got every season on DVD. This sitcom, in my opinion, is the greatest sitcom of all time and it changed the TV world forever. It's a great show."
tt0108778,"Friends is without a doubt the best American TV show ever to air. It has sad and hilarious storylines and makes you feel the sadness and jot out of any situation. The actors do fantastic and you really feel like you know a part of them by the end of the show. This will be a show I will never forget as I make constant references to the episodes. I wish the show could come back on air because I miss them so much, but I'm glad it got all the fame it did because it deserved it."
tt0108778,"Even in 2019 it is very funny. A really great show.
Must watch"
tt0108778,"If you want a show that is filled with romance/drama and comedy, this is the show that is fit for you, because it IS filled with romance,drama and comedy that is why wherever I go I will NEVER forget that show,those characters and those series. I am unlikely to give good reviews but F.R.I.E.N.D.S really captured my heart!This show is the BEST show that I EVER watched because: 1.It makes me laugh. 2.Whenever I am lonely I watch the show so that I will be happy again. 3.The actors and actresses portray their characters very well. 4.The stories are unique. 5.The script IS Amazing!So now that I gave you the reasons why I love it... I now recommend you to watch It!"
tt0108778,"I am such a fan of the Friends tv show. The characters are well developed independently and together they play off each other well. Some moments are cheesy while others are funny, while the rest is just very well acted and dialogued by the cast. 
At least give the first season episodes a go, if you still don't like it, don't watch it. But for those who enjoy a well developed multi character show..... Friends is sure to make you laugh and want to get to know each character more. 
Its a television show.... there are bound to be goofs or inconsistencies, no television show has ever ever in the history of tv been 200% perfect. 
I plan on buying the whole series on Blue-Ray soon to add to my dvds."
tt0108778,"It's really crazy but I still watch Friends 4 times a week. There is nothing that could cheer me up like this on a full day. The humor, the characters, the details (i see more and more every time - and I've watched every episode A LOT). I was born in 1992 and the last 4-5 seasons I bought when they just came out. I have them all on DVD. I have the Friends Book. Just missing a 'Frankie says hi' t-shirt to join the collection ;-) I just dissapear in the serie when I watch it. Love it.
BIG CRAZY FAN says bye! X"
tt0108778,"I love this show so much! F.R.I.E.N.D.S is a sitcom that you could easily binge-watch at any time of the day. I was able to finish the whole 10 seasons, which ran for 10 years, in under a month. That's just how great it is! I can't even give it a negative review about anything. You'll just really learn to love all the characters through time. No wonder people have clamored for a reunion with the cast, you just can't get enough of it.When you're feeling down and think you could use a good laugh, put this one on top of your to-watch list. It doesn't matter that the show ran from 1994-2004, the humor it had is timeless!In a perfect world where we could pick a series that could run forever, F.R.I.E.N.D.S would be that show. Notice how different TV networks are still doing re-runs at present time even after it has ended back in '04. You'll find that a new generation of viewers who are watching and loving it are surprised to discover that the cast are quite old already. Nothing could beat it."
tt0108778,I believe friends has been the only tv show that i have watched over and over many times and still never got bored of. And all of this was because of one man Mathew Perry(chandler). He was too funny with his jokes and sarcasm. Whenever am stress i just turn to friends and watch Mathew crack his jokes then i feel alright. Is so sad that you left us and i hope you are in a better place. Deep inside you brought joy to me especially in times of stress and i know you are a good person. Rest in perfect peace Mathew. We will miss you very much. And i hope God has send you to a much better place. Much love.
tt0108778,"To this day, the worldwide success of Friends is still a bit of a mystery to me.Sure, the show has its moments, but nothing that groundbreaking or laughing-out-loud funny that would have justified all the accolades.Friends was a very ambivalent show: it had the pretense of being believable, while still relying, and heavily so, on the same old Sticom 101 material.The characters were supposed to be oh so modern and new, but in the end they all fell into a stereotype, as the show was devolving into a comedy-soap. Whatever development the characters had, it was either short-lived, flimsy or a ""Flanderization"" (ie. comical and unrealistic exaggeration of a specific trait that wasn't so dominant earlier on).The core of the show, the infamous Ross+Rachel love story stopped being interesting after the equally infamous ""we were on a break!"" debacle. Both changed their mind and heart at the drop of a hat, which seriously harmed the empathy. Long, drawn-out relationships work only if at least one half of the couple is genuinely suffering about the breakup or about being turned down. Both Ross and Rachel instead acted like 8th graders all along, being over each other and not over each other with no rhyme or reason.It almost felt like them getting back together was the writers' Haily Mary pass... ""We're out of ideas... Let's get Ross and Rachel share a kiss, or have a baby!""The ""happy ending"" feels more like a token send-off to tie some loose ends, but it's really just another knee-jerk reaction of two adults who clearly can't put their act together.The same lack of development hits Joey as well. Despite him being the least objectionable human being of the lot, if you're willing to gloss over his tactless approach to dating, he goes from being a suave ladies' man to a childlike moron who's more or less his married friends baby. His aborted love story with Rachel could have been a much better finale, given he was indeed showing a softer side. But, alas, it had to be Ross+Rachel.Monica and Chandler shared a tragicomically traumatic childhood that left them scarred, so them finding each other made sense and, with all the exaggerated personality quirks (Monica is a control freak, Chandler is socially inept) they're the most believable characters in the end.Phoebe can be fun on small doses, but she's clearly having mental issues, so shoehorning her into married life, albeit while still retaining her out-there personality, felt forced.That's the most annoying side of the show: for all the hype and all the great reviews, Friends was just another sit-com, with plenty of forced drama. The innovative love story between a cute girl and a dork is still sold as a top feature, but I maintain it wasn't that great.Oh well, at least the show has aged horribly, so the chances of it still being perceived as one of the best of all time are getting smaller. Nostalgia will still keep it going strong, but to those who loved it so much back then I ask... watch it again and see if it was worth all the praise."
tt0108778,"It is quite simple. Friends is a comedy of very basic humour aimed at teenagers and young adults, with unsophisticated sense of humour.It is also painfully obvious that towards the end, they were desperately trying to make it last 10 seasons, most likely so they could say they beat Seinfeld's 9 season run. The trouble with this is, Seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great writing, Friends had (and I'm being very generous here) at most 5 or 6 OK seasons and then 4 abysmal seasons.It became a soap opera with recycled humour and recycled character traits that weren't that good so start with, then got worse at the 100th time you saw them. I find it so hard to understand why people rate this so highly. It is truly awful."
tt0108778,"People are saying that friends is running out of ideas and that the humour is getting dull. Running out of ideas? possibly. Humour getting feeble? absolutely not. In fact it's getting better. OK, so perhaps they're beginning to ""pair up"" the six of them, but so what. Chandler's sarcasm is still as funny as ever. Monica's quirkiness still works. Phoebe's goofiness still brings about a smile. And Joey,Rachel and Ross are still as funny as they always were. So stop being a bunch of cynics and enjoy the show while it's still on."
tt0877057,"I will be short, the series is a gem: character buildup, screenwriting, tension, drama, art, cinematography, everything. Truly captivating story......until (without spoiling it) the main story arc ends quite anticlimactically and new subplot begins with new characters in the primal focus. The latter half takes away a hint of brilliance from rest of the story.Still I would recommend it!"
tt0877057,"This is anime at its best. I'm fairly new to the world of anime, but I have to say from what I've seen that Death Note goes above and beyond your typical run-of-the-mill action based anime. Whereas a lot of anime strategically relies on action packed battles and fights, Death Note is a refreshing change of pace. It's slick, clever, and witty with the eccentric ""L"" heading the investigation. It's a constant game of cat and mouse as the lead investigator and the suspected ""Kira"" or ""Killer"" always seem to be one step ahead of one another. The two brilliant minds constantly outwit each other. The plot is complex but easily laid out for you and the story is remarkably intelligent and inventive. All the while you're watching you think, ""Wow, this can't possibly get any deeper,"" but each new episode proves you wrong. What I like the most is that this is very, very complex material but it's flawlessly and easily presented so each new development in the case comes as an excited shock.This is great stuff and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who might be looking for a change of pace in anime. It's not for everyone, of course since it's more of an intellectual thriller and not so much an action fantasy, but anyone who can appreciate the mental challenge of following along with this suspenseful battle of wits will be in heaven with Death Note."
tt0877057,"After watching the first six episodes, I find that the story line is very well though out. Unlike many series, Death Note has a way of keeping ahead of the watcher, and one can never predict what is about to happen. The series is obviously dark. One of the things that I find interesting about Death Note that the protagonist isn't the good guy, like that of the stereotypical protagonist. The fact that this series goes morally were few others will go is definitely one of the reasons I find this series to be so enticing.I'm definitely hooked!"
tt0877057,The first 25 episodes of Death Note are simply insane. The mental fight between L and Yagame Light is something I've never seen before in that intensity. They are both such great characters so if either of them wins you will be sad for the other one. The last 12 episodes were still pretty good but just not at the same level as before. But the ending was really great again and a worthy one.
tt0877057,This is good. I don't watch anime. I watched all of this. It is very good.
tt0877057,"From the pages of the manga to the silver screen and then to the small screen. Manga = breathtaking, Film = groundbreaking, Anime = phenomenal.Death Note the anime is one of the best animes to come out for a very long time. The storyline is amazing but not complicated or cliché. Like the film and manga, it depicts the cat and mouse hunt between L and Light on who will uncover one another's identity.Death Note is a cake; everything good about a cake; and therefore people should see this landmark. Overall, Death Note will remain a classic forever... if the Americans don't remake and ruin it!!!10/10"
tt0877057,"This show just keeps getting better and better! Every episode has a new twist, and is never the same as the last! It will keep you on the edge of your seat, and you will watch it again and again! The story is centered around a young man, Yagami Raito/Light who finds a ""Death Note"". I won't tell you anymore about this ""Death Note"" (as that would spoil it). With this ""Death Note"" he sets about ridding the world of evil and creating a ""Utopia"", with himself as the new god. Filled with interesting characters, lots of intelligent dialouge and exiting plot twists, this show is definitely on my top 10! I would Highly recommend it to anyone, those who enjoy crime/psychological/dark themes."
tt0877057,"Death Note was a stellar TV Show and on its way to being one of my favorite animated TV Shows. With its incredible concept, interesting villainous protagonists and an antithesis to the protagonist that complimented his genius perfectly. The formula was great with the exception of episodes 18-22 which features our protagonists cunning on a boring way that leads to a lackluster payoff. After this however. Episodes 23, 24 and 25 are phenomenal works of art. This is where the series goes from Incredible to incredibly mediocre. With the exception of the last 3 episodes of the show, there is no right for any of the episodes after episode 25 to exist. The show went from having me completely invested to it feeling like a chore to finish, which is a shame because of how great the last 3 episodes actually were. They introduce new antagonists that are literally the exact same thing as the last one we had, except much worse and no fun at all to watch. I was frustrated with these new characters and their placement in the show. In my opinion Death Note should have ended at episode 25 then it would have been a nearly perfect anime."
tt0877057,"This manga is exceptional: smart, captivating and suspenseful. The script is up to the drawings: astonishing and entertaining. I loved it!"
tt0877057,"I am glad to see that despite the average of 9.0 from numerous voters... there are still many people here who can look at this anime series from an objective point of view and openly state its flaws.No need for me to go into details or spoilers at all. I've seen about every Death Note there is to see (aside from the 2017 American series which I refuse to watch just on principle). Like many here I understand the Death Note concept and found the original move to be a masterpiece.But this anime... it was like packing a 2 hour movie into a 14 hour slow-motion treadmill. As pointed out by several others-- plot concepts were repeated, concepts thrown in and then ignored, and by the 20th episode I was feeling like Ryuk... bored bored bored. Although well-presented, this felt like nothing more than someone trying to drag out the original story lines to as many episodes as they could possibly milk. But the cow ran dry long before the series ended.Filled with gaping plot holes, lack of logic, areas of ridiculous complexity and jump-the-shark ""logic""... this felt like an old Charlie Chan movie mystery where one person says ""I have won because"" and the other person says ""Except I foresaw that and"" and then the first person says ""But I knew you foresaw it so I"" and then the second person... well, you get the idea. Savvy viewers can only handle so much of that stuff before they start thinking ""seriously?"".The gore in the very final episode was unprecedented in the series, gratuitous and totally unnecessary to ending the story. There was a strong feeling of anti-climax pretty much through the entire last half of the series (if not before). I started questioning where they were going somewhere after the 10th episode. At the 20th episode I was asking ""how long are they going to drag this on?"". By the time we got to episode 30 I had given up all hope and watched the rest on sheer ""closure"" factor-- let's get this watched and over with.One major mistake in production which I don't understand (probably had something to do with legal rights) was the change in the theme song about halfway through. They went from a barely-tolerable beginning and end song to a total-trash, super-heavy-metal theme song that sounded like it came out of some stoner's garage band. If the purpose of that ""music"" was to convince us there are insane people in the world... it was a total success. I like just about all kinds of music, but that second theme song was a loser in both concept and performance and did nothing to support the series. It turned Death Note into Dead Note and was a terrible choice for theme music.One scene especially (no spoilers) where someone was going to murder two people in cold blood to eliminate Kira-- all I can say is the writers must have been smoking weed when they came up with that lame concept. That didn't make any sense from any viewpoint, and certainly was not Death Note. They had a shark jump the shark on that one.In the end the series was way too long, too contrived in plot, and had too many unbelievable points and logic flaws to stand up to examination. No matter how much someone may have enjoyed the original Death Note movie, if viewed honestly this anime just doesn't stand up to the standards of good anime or the Death Note concept either one. I'm a great fan of the original 2006 movie... but I was yawning 2/3 of the way through this series. The story line was forced and mediocre at best. As I've stated with a couple of other Death Note wannabe's... we don't need yet another Death Note; the original was just fine."
tt0877057,"No spoilers... This show has a great starting foothold. The mixing between mythical fantasy world of god of death and police detective story line is brilliant, just works brilliantly.
But as the story grows the details on how things work out gets blurry and un logical character decision making happens more and more often
But overall very enjoyable despite the weak finish, and oddly i am hoping there is a death note 2"
tt0877057,"I have seen many anime but few compare to Death Note. It provides it's viewers with incredible characters, a deep storyline, and view of how power can corrupt. The focus of the story is on Yagami Light, a college student who is feed-up with what he considers a rotting world. He soon finds a notebook named ""Death Note."" The instructions state that any human whose name is written in the Death Note will die as long as the person who writes the victim's name has the victim's face in mind at that time. While Light considers it to be a foolish prank, his curiosity gets the best of him. Upon learning that the Death Note is real, Light realizes he has the chance to rid the world of crime and create a new world over which he reigns supreme. The story of Death Note follows Light as he tries to create his new world, and the forces that try to stop him. Perhaps one of the most interesting elements of the series is that the main character is neither a hero or an anti-hero but instead an anti-villain. This an excellent series that is guaranteed to leave viewers in awe."
tt0877057,"I have to say two things turned me off. First is the idiot reviewer on the front page who feels the need to use 70% of his review(even titled it ""Eat Your Heart Out Naruto""-really subtle) to bash Naruto like some insecure 12 year old spoiled brat fan boy. Pathetic. The second was that it sounded like some Gothic action anime from others. However when I finally saw it I thought, meh, okay. However as it went on I got more and more drawn in.The plot is simple enough to start:successful and brilliant student Light stumbles upon the Death Note, which will kill anyone who's name he writes down provided it's their real name and he knows his face. He experiments with it and sees that it's real. He plays with the other rules all the while killing other criminals and meeting up with the shinigami who wrote the death note. The deaths of these criminals does not go unnoticed as the renound and mysterious detective El is trying to discover who Light, under the name Kira, is. Whoever finds the other's identity first will win in this power struggle.Like I said, the first episode is interesting enough. The story however develops and becomes better and more complex as it goes on. The moral ambiguity of the anime gives it a unique feel among others of it's kind. I was shocked to see a show like this under Shounen jump which usually host anime that combine strong actions scenes with a complex plot and character development. What we have here instead is an anime that dosen't have adrenaline pumping action scenes advancing the plot(not that there's anything wrong with that, in fact I enjoy that as well) but the proverbial chess game between Light and the police as Light becomes well aware the police are after him as he does everything possible to hide himself all the while continuing to do away with criminals at his whim.Ryuk, the shinigami who follows Light, actually provies some of the comic relief of the show believe it or not. He's not over the top goofy by any means however if there's any laughs to be derived, it's usually from him.Even if you're not a fan of Shounen Jump anime, you should give Death Note a try. It easily rivals the majority of thriller films. It is well worth your time."
tt0877057,"I watched one episode and thought the first episode wasn't pretty good, but when i started too watch(watching episode 11 now) i started too love it, its genius and the guy who made this movie got too be one of the smartest filmmaker ever, The animation is one of the best, the story is smart, deep and exemplary written , the characters are interesting, i can gladly say i haven't found one error in this series, so even if you don't watch much anime i just recommend you too watch this and i can swear that you will like it, i think this is as good as elfen lied(or even better). The story is about a guy named light who is top-student and smartest guy in school(without being a geek), one day some kind of diary named ''death note'' falls down from the sky and he picks it up, and then the story begins.. a must see for everyone!!!10/10"
tt0877057,"In the first episode, you can already see the amazing animation, the well-chosen voices, the immediate gripping of fear over the future in your chest. Death Note is a must-see for those who love to have a good 5 minutes of thinking because Death Note beautifully weaves suspense and unexpected turn of events that leaves the audience stunned and fascinated.You'll notice the good production, but to truly decide whether it's worth watching you will have to watch to the 2nd (and for those who are stubborn, the 3rd) episode. If you are planning to watch this for a limited of time, you're in luck because the series is only 37 episodes long since the manga already ended.While the IQ of the two main characters is straight-out impossible, you still cannot feel but admire just how logical their reasons for making possibilities and theories are (what makes it even scarier is that most of the theories that L or Light, the two protagonists, are true). If you are one who watches things from a personal view, you would have a hard time deciding whether the things they are doing are right and if they are, in reality, insane.There is slight humor that adds faint scratches on the anime, but it is soon covered up in the next minute with what a character has done or said. There was not a moment where I wasn't sitting at the edge of my seat, my eyes literally sticking to the screen. Every minute is worth watching, even the sinister theme songs played by Nightmare.What makes this anime/manga unique is that it's a mystery thriller where you hardly question the origins of something. You rarely ask yourself unanswerable questions (not even in the back of your mind) and without realizing, you're only focused on the present events.I promise, no matter what kind of audience you are, you will be gripped by this chilling life and death chain of events of a bored genius who kills criminals mercilessly with the mysterious Death Note."
tt0877057,"Despite the fact that I haven't read the manga, I can say that Death Note is one of the best anime I've ever seen. The story & characters amazing and complex. It's a classic cat & mouse game between the hero and the villain on who try to find out about the others' identity. The animation is amazing, which is that you can always expect from japan. Overall, Death Note is a classic anime that is beloved by many and will continue to remain beloved for many years to come."
tt0877057,"The series starts off great. There are around 5 excellently developed characters; there's a great premise; the plot develops logically and compellingly; the pacing of building tension then action is spot on. You've got a unique feel, and some moral dilemma action thought-provoking action. Everything has a balanced and cohesive feel - pretty much everything you'd expect when you see a series rated 8.9.*I have to warn a very slight plot spoil, but I won't give anything remotely specific.* Then about halfway through the series, to solve some stagnation they throw in a good dose of anticlimax. Now the majority of the interesting characters stop getting any screen time for various reasons and follow up by introducing and then disposing of characters you never have any reason to care about. The very ending was well done. (Pity it wouldn't make sense if you just skipped the 15 episodes preceding it!)Maybe the manga developed all of the lame characters in the second half and had I first read all of them I would have enjoyed it all, but still... I just can't justify how sloppy everything got. Compare with either of the Fullmetal Alchemist adaptations, or Code Geass if you can tolerate mecha action, and you'll see where I'm coming from.It either needed to be around 20-25 episodes and finish off strong without all of the later stuff, of have been extended to at least 50 so that they could have developed the last half into something workable."
tt0877057,"I just watched all the 37 episodes after some friends recommended the series. I am not sure why I watched them all, to be honest. Really unlikable characters, same things happening over and over again, with some rare twists that are not even that brilliant. I am completely ignorant of the anime world, and this might be considered good. But it never happened to me to be so utterly indifferent about the main characters (especially after the time jump). So watch it if you really don't have anything better to do, or if you really like egocentric and self-loving, arrogant, overbearing, presumptuous characters who try to defeat ""mistrerious"" and brooding ones by ""manipulating"" an army of weak and stupid (by the main character's own definition) ones."
tt0877057,"Honestly, I'm not a regular anime viewer but I rather consider this show as live action due to its realistic nature and I really love it from core of my heart. Just♥ it"
tt0289649,"I'm from Argentina myself and I can say this series is one of the best ones this country has ever shot. It depicts a 2000/2001 crisis we were living through and how ordinary people had to struggle with life evey single day.Every character is unique and you have no choice but to end up loving or hating them. Not only the four MC are cool, but also the antagonists and even their pet, a lovely and really intelligent dog, are amazing!You know, due to Copyright issues, there was no official DVD released ever. However, it's still popular nowadays and views keep going up!!!You can only watch it on Youtube or download it illegally around, and I think no subtitles exist. (If I happen to see people asking for it, I'll sub every episode on my own)Okupas is one of those shows which show up every 50 years. So it's a must to watch it!If you want the subtitiles, just mark my review as helpful and once I see enough clicks on YES, I'll start working into it!"
tt0289649,"In such a crude and realistic way, it portrays the experience of young people without financial support who live on questionable acts to gain resources. In short, a shocking drama with some overtones of social horror and suspense on a fairly well calibrated level. The best Argentine series."
tt0289649,"What a gem.The series addresses several themes, from the housing problem, passing through the youth's lack of perspective on life, to the chronic violence that comes from the brutal inequality typical of Latin American societies.Without ever falling into moralism, far from trying to teach the public hypocritical lessons, it manages to amuse and entertain with a compelling story that have moments of comedy, action, suspense and a bit of drama.With the remastering and release by netflix in 2021, I was finally able to watch the 11 episodes of this magnificent series, being able to understand the status it conserved through the years.Watch it!"
tt0289649,"I´M a movie director myself and I only can say this is the kind of story I would like to shot someday. There´s no middle term, you love it or you hate it, but reality is always there. When I see ""Okupas"", I´m seeing that someone is talking of something that lived in own flesh, was on that places, connected with that kind of people, and mixed with a sense of fiction and caracthers construction ends up in a total identification; you´re no longer an espectator you just live and experience from inside. Some people saw ""Okupas"" as a show of crime, an allegory of dope using, and lower class habits and ways of life, and said that they prefered to watch the 8 o´clock news to see what´s wrong with the country. To others there´s nothing better to deeply know about it without discriminate and then start a social change and a work of unification for a most acceptable kind of living... If you liked ""Okupas"", I can also recommend you: ""Pizza, Birra, Faso""(Pizza, Beer, Cigarrettes- Stagnaro), ""Tumberos"" (Adrián Caetano), ""UnOso Rojo"" (A Red Bear, Caetano), and ""El Bonaerense"" (Pablo Trapero)."

It's a cult serie. Don't missed."
tt0289649,"This story takes place in an Argentina economical crisis, and these 4 guys, living in a house that is not theirs, have to face not only the police, but other gangs who want to take ""their"" house. And even though they are not saints, they will win your hearts, you will definitely love them.I believe this is not just a story about the harsh reality or how many obstacles these people have to face, but a story about friendship.Esta historia transcurre en un momento de una gran crisis económica en Argentina. Y estos 4 amigos, que viven en una casa que no les pertenece, deben enfrentar a la policía y a otros bandas que quieren ocupar ""su"" casa. Si bien ellos no son ningunos santos, logran ganarse tu corazón.Creo que esta serie no trata simplemente la cruda realidad de este grupo de chicos, ni los obstáculos que deben enfrentar, sino más bien es una historia de amistad."
tt0289649,"Set in Argentina in the year 2000, under a deep crisis resulting from the convertibility model initiated by Carlos Ménem and continued under the government of Fernando De la Rúa, the only thing left for the Argentine middle class to ignore the impoverishment, unemployment and social conflict in the country was television as an escape route. Chiquititas in the afternoon, Tinelli and Gasoleros at night, and Mirtha Legrand on Sundays. But every day, marginality grew, the pockets of the popular classes were shrinking, and capital flight was beating like the heart of the rats of those who took the benefits of One to One. Okupas appeared, precisely, to squat that only space of comfort that was available to the ostentatious and aspirational class in a devastated country. Okupas is the reflection of an excluded majority that was deprived of a decent home, a job or any future in a system that not only left them to their fate, but did not guarantee them anything, and took everything away from them. An excellent story that narrates the misadventures of a middle class young man, frustrated with the moment he is living in his life, decides to become corrupt and get to know the depths of social marginality: gangs, guns, drugs, alcohol, violence of all kinds. Friendship unites four young people who have fallen by the wayside of the system, and they will seek not only to survive the marginality, but also to survive themselves as a group."
tt0289649,"The series is really short so give it a try, you would be on the last episode without realizing. Great acting, characters development, directing. Everything was on point.I must say I´m a little conflicted by the ending, it finished a little bit open in my opinion, I mean it´s really probable some people would say ""oh that was good, where´s the second season?"". It hasn´t got another one so and it doesn´t need it. But at least they should have added 10 minutes more for a definitve closure."

There doesn't seem to be a calming influence amongst the four as they get into one scrape to another with Ricardo getting far too out of his depth with the seedy underworld of Buenos Aires.I watched the whole series in Peru where it was on Netflix, excellent acting and a great storyline, well worth a watch indeed."
tt0289649,"This tv show honestly is very good to me. It has it all, action, comedy, realism, everything! It shows a very strong reality of what happened in Argentina in those years."

tt0167261,"Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word ""epic"" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on.10/10"
tt0167261,"It seems ridiculous to want to add my own comments to a slew of others that are already in IMDB's records, but I feel like I cannot sleep nor cease the throbbing in my chest until I release some of what I have so recently seen.Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings is one of the bravest projects ever attempted by a filmmaker. Mr Jackson deserves every ovation he will receive, every award, every bit of the praise and adoration that will be spoken and written.This second installment of the story is a masterpiece in every sense, forget your prejudices about the books, they are another way of looking at this beautiful story (I know this is slightly against the rules, but a I cannot resist saying that a previous writers comment - a comment that compared the Lord of the Rings Films and Books to the difference between Romeo and Juliet in screenplay and ballet formats - was entirely accurate).Gollum was an excellent amalgam, so easily could he have been an annoying Jar-Jar-Binks-Alike. Instead the way that Jackson and Serkis (and doubtless many many others) chose to portray the CGI incarnation of ""Smeagol"" was incredibly emotive and powerful. Gollum is profoundly disturbing, amusing, almost lovable... Not even John Ronald Reuel himself could induce that range of emotions for Smeagol in me...A truly skin-crawling performance by a superb Brad Douris as the evil Grima Wormtongue was just beyond words. Douris _Became_ Wormtongue in a skillful fulfillment of what was already inspired casting.Probably the most definitive casting of this film though was Manchester born Bernard Hill as Theoden, King of Rohan. The casting for ""The Two Towers"" makes one shake ones head and wonder, in retrospect, whether anyone else could have filled these roles. Mr Hill's performance was truly first rate, a performance which contributed greatly to ""The Battle of Helms Deep"", scenes which were a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer.Viggo Mortensen goes from strength to strength. His performance is visceral and yet sensitive. The overriding emotion that Tolkiens vision of Aragorn induced (at least for me) was awe at his heroics. Mortensen's portrayal in Jackson's frame brings new aspects to the Aragorn character. Mortensen's Aragorn is emotionally dextrous to go with his physical dexterity, he is sensitive, seemingly empathic, warmer and more fundamentally human, and yet super-human in presence and charisma. ""Definitive"" is not strong enough of a word.If you still view Jackson's epic with scepticism I implore you to put down your preconceptions and your prejudices, but most of all put down the books... This is beautiful way to see middle earth, don't pass it up - The books are the ultimate fantasy epic - the pictures you draw in your head are better than anything you can imagine, but The Lord of the Rings ""The Two Towers"" is one wonderful interpretation of that epic story.Go, Laugh, Cry, and Sit in Awe of this cinematic treat."
tt0167261,"The Fellowship of the Ring was a monumentally entertaining film, the Return of the King was an amazing wrap-up to the epic of our times, but the most dramatic moment for me came at the end of the Two Towers. After 3 hours of sweeping vistas, excellent Shakespearean acting, and otherworldly sights and sounds, we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of a hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the camera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I am swept away like I've never been before.This is cinema at its very best."
tt0167261,"From the beginning to the very end, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is interesting and enjoyable. The books and the movies alike grasp one's attention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sense the pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is truly powerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has something the first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two great islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be described. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. The third movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made."
tt0167261,"The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.As stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.As was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.In The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.If not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers."
tt0167261,Great movie I really enjoyed watching and better than the first part
tt0167261,"Really, I should probably let this film soak in a bit; I am, after all, on something of a ""post-viewing"" high right now. However, at this moment, my feeling remains the same from the first installment - this is the movie experience I've been waiting my whole life for. In case you haven't gathered, this movie is visually stunning, literally breathtaking. I mean that, some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks, shocked at the pure, enveloping beauty of the shot. Peter Jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had.The acting is, as always, superb. Kudos for hiring ""actors"" not ""stars""; ""Oscar-worthy"" over-acting could have threatened the realistic touch the film's remarkable cast supply. Specific mention goes to both John Rhys-Davies in his well enjoyed comic turn, and very largely to Andy Serkis, who was a major role in creating the most realistic and brilliantly well-performed CGI character I've ever seen (Gollum).For the most part, and as a fan of the books, I take no offense to the slight plot modifications. My understanding is that Tolkien himself realized that visual adaptation of LotR would require a somewhat different take on his work, and was apparently open to such minute changes. There are also a few tiny bits and pieces I was disappointed to see not make the final cut, however, I'm sure a future inevitable extended DVD will take care of those.In short, if you found the continual enjoyment I did with the first movie of LotR, this movie will in no way let you down. Not even for a minute.Highly recommended, 10/10."
tt0167261,"In the Two Towers (TT) we are re-united with most of our heroes from the Fellowship of the Ring (FotR). Split apart by betrayal, and a company of orcs, Frodo and Sam have begun the last leg of their quest to Mordor. Ant and Dec (sorry, Merry and Pippin) are prisoners of the orcs, pursued by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli  a quest that brings the company, and the people of Rohan, closer to conflict.Opinion is divided about the second film. The entertainment junkies seem to think it's better than the first, largely on account of the Battle of Helms Deep, which is rather impressive. I thought it was a bit weaker, mainly because, in a wilderness adventure, there's more emphasis on the characters than in the spectacle of set piece action; and because the CGI is less subtle as a result.Once again, liberties are taken with the story. There's no riding of the Grey Company. There's a more obvious tension between Eowyn and Aragorn (Legolas has to remind Aragorn who he's dating), and (controversial among the Tolkienites) Faramir's character has been darkened somewhat. In fact, the directorial trait of adding more colour to the main characters while painting out the subtlety of the peripheral ones continues from FotR. Partly because we're introduced to more characters in TT, the overall effect leaves the film slightly two-dimensional. On balance I thought the treatment of Faramir to be less heinous than that of Denethor in Return of the King, but more on that later.The mood, though, remains pure Tolkien and that, more than anything, is the triumph of the movie. From the Beowulf-like set for Meduseld (Tolkien famously nicked his description of the seat of Rohan from the UK's first epic) to the majestic sweep of New Zealand, the film more than once reminded me of my own mental images of Tolkien's world. And, once again, I found myself interested in the story.So, to the flaws. I mentioned in an earlier review of FotR the astonishing heighism in Peter Jackson's adaptation. You can imagine Jackson scratching his head wondering what to do for laughs now that Ant and Dec have been nicked by Ugluk, Grishnakh and the lads. His solution is ingenious; find the next shortest member of the company. Gimli, therefore, shoulders the mantle of comedy relief. As a strapping man of 6'4'' I am allowed a certain disdainful disinterest to such a phenomenon; but it is worth noting. Also worth noticing is the astonishing transformation of Arwen from a feisty, most un-Tolkien lady in FotR to the submissive pre-Raphaelite stereotype of the books. I guess this is because Eowyn has turned up, but still. The Elves still speak like they're doped up, except the peculiarly immune elfin fancy boy, Legolas. On that note, was it really necessary for him to mount his horse that way? Or surf his way down a staircase at the battle of Helms Deep? Jim Horner should do an alternative Beach Boys theme for that scene.Anyway, these are minor points in a film that is, if not a major, then at least a minor, triumph. As mentioned by others, the film is worth seeing for Gollum alone. And I can think of many more reasons to see it. You could also check out the extended version, which is even better. 7/10."
tt0167261,"I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Fellowship' and was eagerly awaiting the release of 'two towers'. I have never read the books but was informed that the 'Two Towers' would be even better than it's predecessor as the plot thickens and action really gets going. However, on leaving the cinema after watching this film I was left somewhat disappointed.I have read review after review saying this is peoples favourite film. I mean come on, be serious. It takes an age to get going and if it was not for the climactic battle of Helm's Deep would have been the worst excuse for a 3 hour long film since the first two hours of Titanic. Even in this ground breaking climax it is constantly interrupted by Treebeard, the character that personifies the slowness of the rest of the film. Also the attempted romance between Viggo Mortenson and Liv Tyler's characters seems just to be in this film because Liv complained of lack of screen time because there certainly doesn't seem any need for her character in this instalment apart from this pointless sub-plot.The creation of Gollum was simply brilliant and deserved the Oscar but I was pleased to see this film ignored in the other categories. One thing is for sure, I will not look forward to the next sequel as much as I did this one, following this film's disappointment."
tt0167261,"Every great adventure story worth telling has a solid hero - someone who puts others before themselves and uses their talents to do their best at keeping the forces of evil at bay even if it means the loss of life and limb. At its core, this movie has eight such heroes and each one lives up to the call. From Pippin and Merry, the lost hobbits who aid the Ents in battle, to Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas who held back the hordes at Helms Deep to Frodo and Samwise who continue to make their dangerous and arduous trek to Mount Doom. All of these characters are heroes and they're played with love, respect and meaning.Though the acting in this film was top notch throughout, I found myself amazed by Gollum's (motion captured body and voice by Andy Serkis) overall performance. Though obviously CGI, there was so much emotion in this character that I couldn't help believe he was real! Though ""Final Fantasy"" was the only movie that created the most realistic CGI characters that dominated an entire film, Gollum is lightyears ahead with the simple fact that this deformed li'l hobbit seemed human. He had the spark of life behind those eyes that the FF ""cast"" lacked.As a film, this movie has it all - action, drama, comedy - but none of it would've worked without characters we cared about, villains we despised and heroes we cheered for. With the obvious success of the first two installments, the release of the final film next December may prove this to be THE BEST trilogy ever made!"
tt0167261,"As you know Tolkien did a great job with creating the world. Also did a perfect job with writing the battles. Also It's not that easy to fitting that to the adaptation. The whole cast did pretty perfect job with The Two Towers. I know whole Trilogy made in same time. Only the film editors are changing through the trilogy. So they managed a great job making these movies.I think The Siege of Minas-Tirith sequence is also pretty good and flawless. But the horror and darkness is so effective in The Helm's Deep Battle. You may predict the Rohan People are going to win, they're the good guys after all. But even if you are watching this movie second time, you will feel that hopeless times again.The first half of the movie feels slow, I think that brings realistic style to a fantasy movie. Of course there is too important scenes in the first half of the movie, I'm saying the most important scenes are in the second half of the movies. This goes for all three movies.Tell me how can a movie achieve this much? Costume Design, Makeup, Art Direction & Set Decoration, Film Editing, VFX, SFX, Scores. The Trilogy manages to be revolutionary nearly all of that. At least it is Revolutionary in 5 of them. Some movies made me love some genres, The Lord of the Rings made me love the Cinema."
tt0167261,"Seriously, I never thought a movie could get better than the Fellowship of the Ring, but it did. This movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250. This movie, as long as it was, captivated me from start to finish, and those who are not entertained by this movie can not be entertained period.
Yes, I have read the book. Any chapters cut out at the end of books III and IV will probably themselves in the next installment. If you haven't noticed, the beginning of the Two Towers was actually closed the Fellowship of the Ring on the big screen.Gollum was a CG masterpiece. He added some light to this incredibly dark movie. At the same time, there are areas where you feel sorry for the poor guy, or just want to kill him. Smeagol was probably the most diverse character I've ever seen.Elijah Wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie, as did Sean Astin. Ian McKellen, who captivated us in the last movie, captivated us even more in this one. Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies, and Orlando Bloom made a great trio. They laughed together, cried together, prospered together, and suffered together. This trio gave life to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Eowyn expressed her emotions clearly through Miranda Otto. The music need not be discussed. Its greatness speaks for itself.Favorite Scene: The Battle of Helms Deep. Possibly the greatest scene in the book, 50% of the trailer, and action packed climax to this beautiful movie.
The movie, like its predecessor, fails to bring us closure, but that's ok. Closure will come next year. I look forward to the Return of the King.The Two Towers is now my favorite movie of all time.The scale is broken. 10 is not a capacity sufficient enough to hold this movie... my movie... my... precious..."
tt0167261,I have to say this film starting with the fellowship was incredibly well made. I know Titanic received 11 awards but I think this whole trilogy should receive 15. This intro to the trilogy was extremely in depth and even had the best prologue ever. I enjoy being introduced to the characters and thier origins and learning about the history of the one ring and how it does evil upon middle earth even after Sauron's death. Be patient with the action as is picks up as the trilogy's story unfolds. It all depends on what you see movies for. But this whole trilogy has quite a bit of everything. That alone surpasses all movies.10/10 (actually more than that)
tt0167261,"The quest to melt the ring in Doom continues, as two Hobbits and a Gollum lacking sinews, crossing marshes full of dread, towards the Black Gate's where they head, and then they're captured by the brother, of one once dear (although he was somewhat affected by the ring before expiring). After fleeing from an evil band of orcs, another pair of Hobbits sit with stalks, of an Ent known as Treebeard, who gets annoyed when friends are sheared, summons brethren, and against the foe they walk. Helm's Deep provides the backdrop for a battle, where sabres, swords and axes are all rattled, but walls come tumbling down, as the Uruk-hai hit town, when their hoards stampede and charge like crazy cattle."
tt0167261,"I do love all three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here. When it comes to the scope The Two Towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. The cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. You can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. The music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. People may disagree, but I think The Two Towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.The acting is very good. Elijah Wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while Sean Astin's bumbling persona suits Sam really well. Viggo Mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is Gollum. Here Gollum is designed superbly, and Andy Serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and Oscar-nod worthy.In conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0167261,"I considered The Fellowship of the Ring to be one of the greatest movies ever. This one is better!The scenery is marvelous, the animations great, and the story superb. This episode strays further from the books when it comes to the unfolding of events, but I feel that it stays closer in atmosphere and realism; the nazgûls are now the fear-inspiring creatures they should be. Gollum, excellently implemented, even becomes more realistic then I remember him from the books, not to mention other attempts to portray him. His schizophrenic monologues are among the highlights of the movie.The major drawback is once again the apparent incapability of the dark-side creatures. Aragorn with fellows can ride back and forth among them unhurt, while the Uruk-Hai fall in large numbers just for being nearby. Though I enjoy many of the jokes made at Gimli's expense, this still is another thing I partly dislike. Gimli sure is no clown in the books.I rate the movie 9/10 (my highest so far)."
tt0167261,"Vote: 8.8 (rounded up to 9)The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an amazing movie that any Tolkien fan, adventure fan, or war fan should see. Acting: Elijah Wood as Frodo is amazing. He really captures the pain that the poor little hobbit must be going through. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is excellent,even though he has a much smaller role than in FOTR. Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn was another good choice and you could really experience what he must be going through. John Rys-Davies was really good as Gimli, but his jokes got really tiring before the end. Sean Astin as Sam fit the description of good old Sam well and also acted out the character perfectly. Bernard Hill as Theoden, Brad Dourif as Grima, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, Karl Urban as Eomer, David Wenham as Faramir and Liv Tyler as Arwen were all excellent actors. Gollum was really amazing. Andy Serkis deserves some award, for the perfect cat coughing up fur ball voice for Gollum, and kudos to the design team who made the motion capture suit. I wish we could have seen more of Christopher Lee as he is a superb actor. Orlando Bloom as Legolas, on the other hand, sucked. He had absolutely no emotion and if it wasn't for his fighting scenes then the character would have been totally wasted. Dominic Monaghan as Merry and Billy Boyd as Pippin were also good actors. Directing: Peter Jackson did another excellent job in this movie, though as i said in my FOTR review, his career as a horror movie maker hurt him. The scene where all the dead Orc bodies were piled up and one of their heads was on a pole wasn't really necessary (and then Gimli was going through the burning remains (hmmmm orc barbecue), and there was another stupid scene were you saw the Uruks being born out of mud sacs. Screenplay: Good, the only scene they needed was the one in the extended edition of the flashback between Faramir, Boromir and Denethor. That scene was really necessary to describe Faramirs character Special Effects: Too amazing for words. The Battle of Helms Deep was so perfect you couldn't tell what was CGI and what wasn't. Gollum didn't look like a fake. The battle of Isengard was also well done and when the ents broke the dam and Isengard was flooded i was reminded of a disaster flick. The special effects alone were worth the price of admission. Other: Again the cinematography was beautiful and just jaw-dropping gorgeous. Makes me really want to visit New Zealand just to see the places they filmed. Rohan, and Edoras especially were beautiful. Howard Shore's score was excellent. The Rohan theme song fit the beautiful scenery perfectly. Overall: An excellent movie worth seeing. If the filmmakers weren't so stuck up about themselves this movie would be even better."
tt0167261,"The Two Towers is an enjoyable, and sometimes very good movie, but was a dissappointment to me in the wake of the sheer masterpiece that was The Fellowship Of The Ring.Director Peter Jackson was able to fill the FOTR with a variety of well-developed characters, a sweeping cinematic landscape, a tense and intriguing storyline, and an overall depth that the book itself possessed. I am no expert on the books, but I do know that FOTR truly delivered the spirit of the book.Now having said that, one could just take all the battles and action, and hordes of armies and violent characters that exist in the books, plunk them into a bunch of fighting sequences, and make great action movies.  The FOTR went beyond that, and captured the true heart of the original book, which is why it was so good, and will go down as a cinematic classic, much in the same way the books will go down as litterary classics.Being Peter Jackson more or less filmed the trilogy of Lord Of The Rings films back-to-back, I figured that the sheer brilliance put forth in FOTR would be present.  That is not the case.Instead, Jackson has delivered the aforementioned action movie.  There's epic battle after epic battle, swordsman after swordsman, but little else. The centerpiece of the books and the first film -- the Hobbits -- are something of an afterthought in the TT, while swashbuckling swordsman Aragorn and bow and arrow marksmen Legolas take the spotlight.  These are characters who are embody the standard action movie hero in every sense, but again, don't begin to scrape the depths of the book, which is so much more than what is on display here.There's word that Jackson did a lot of re-shooting and editing to the TT in the last 12 months.  Perhaps he felt the pressure to follow up to the mammoth success of FOTR, and decided to take the safe way out.  But what he may have failed to realise is that what made FOTR so great and popular was it's depth beyond your standard action flick.  In the wake of the downward spiral of the Star Wars films, which suffer from the same condition plauging the TT, movie fans were looking to latch on to a new fantasy epic, that could provide the great effects and all of that good stuff, but also deliver the goods in terms of story, charachter, and overall depth.Complaints aside, this is still a fun movie.  For starters, you know that you enjoyed a movie when it clocks in at 3 hours long, and you don't find yourself getting restless, whcih I did not.  Additionally, The CGI is ultra-impressive, there are lots of incredible visuals (though not on par with the first film), and the action sequences are truly amazing.  I just came out dissappointed because one year ago, I went into the theatre to see FOTR not knowing what to expect, and I was given a completley unexpected masterpiece.  This time, I went into the TT expect to see another classic, and instead I was delivered a big-budget action flick.  Fun movie?  Yes. Great special effects? Yes.  Another classic?  No.On a closing note, I think Roger Ebert's review of this movie hits the nail right on the head, and he is able to articulate many of the thoughts I have on this film very successfully."
tt0167261,"I was greatly anticipating viewing this film after all the hype and enjoying the first one at the cinema. Unfortunatley I thought this was the biggest load of nonsense I had ever seen. I kept waiting and waiting for the story to get interesting ... and then the film finished. Gollum was rubbish, the scene when he was talking to himself was so bad I had to laugh out loud. Why did the Ork/Human hybrids have bad Cockney accents "" I'm haangry, meats back on the menu"" ??? and what was that tree all about. Am i the only person who gets bored by constant close ups and continued Aragon, son of Bagagon, King of Caragon, Ruler of Daragon etc... type dialogue.It made The Phantom Menace look like Seven Samurai"
tt0167261,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is another excellent installment in the thus far excellent trilogy. The film picks up immediately where ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" left off as Elijah Wood and Sean Astin continue their long and seemingly hopeless journey to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mordor. They run into the creature Gollum (played amazingly by Andy Serkis in a revolutionary character-generation). Serkis' motives are unclear as the ring has literally run him insane and created a split personality that combats the character's natural good side. Meanwhile Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan have escaped the dark forces that captured them, but now are in another dilemma as they try to convince a forest of living, moving trees to support their cause for good and truth. Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies receive more help from the likes of Bernard Hill's army and his lovely niece (Mirando Otto). As all this occurs, Ian McKellen comes back and rehashes a role which seemed to have expired late in the first film. Hugo Weaving and daughter Liv Tyler know that victory is not certain and realize that they must leave their true homes forever to protect themselves and the lives of their people. Christopher Lee continues to create chaos with the help of the highly disturbed Brad Dourif (of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" fame). In the end not one, but two key battles will create the sure-to-be electrifying landscape which will be experienced by all in the franchise's final installment (""The Return of the King""). Many view ""The Two Towers"" as an achievement even more impressive than its predecessor. True the film does go beyond the technical faculties of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", but it is hard for me to pick this installment over the first (which will likely always be my favorite). This film is more intense and you get the feeling of real danger and peril throughout, while the first was more of an emotional experience due to its nice elements of friendship, love and personal sacrifice. In short, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is an amazing sequel and it fits in well with the outstanding first film. 5 stars out of 5."
tt1375666,"You only get to watch this for the first time once, so choose your state of mind carefully.
It is a film about movies and dreams and reality, and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter.
It is spectacular, and brutal, and enigmatic and disturbing.
It is beautiful and absorbing.
It is about one of my favourite characters ever to grace the screen.
I don't see it often, in case it's not as good as I like to remember it.
That is my secret, that I lock away in my safe in the basement.
That somewhere there is a perfect world for us all.
For some, perhaps it is in the cinema watching this."
tt1375666,"When you wake up from a good dream, you feel the reality is harsh. When you wake up after a bad dream, you will be sentimentally attached to the beauty of reality. But as long as life is good, reality and dreams don't matter."
tt1375666,"The 20th Century had Casablanca, Star Wars, the Godfather, Blade Runner, and others - this is the first of the 21st Century masterpieces. Truly in awe at how amazing this movie is, an astounding show of all aspects of films. Amazing story and cinematography accompanied with actors worthy of telling the tale. Remarkable and breathtaking."
tt1375666,"When I first watch this movie, I was just shocked with it's twist. I'm not gonna mention details, because can't share any spoilers.Simply this movie makes a complex story, that makes you question so many things. ""Why he is keeping her in his dreams?"" or whatever your question is answering with some well written line. That scene is the key to the whole movie. That line between Cobb and Mal answers all your questions at once.That's why I like this movie so much. Some movies has that potential. Making a complex story that someone could answer with only one sentence. You're waiting for that line for whole content. But most of the contents (I mean movie or TV Series) are not managing that well.Besides the greatness of the storyline this movie has a really great cast. So Acting Performances are also great. Award Winning Cinematography by Wally Pfister was too great. Original Scores by Hans Zimmer was brilliant. Visual Effects are unique. So not only the Screenplay but nearly all the technical details are great."
tt1375666,"Inception is my number one favorite movie off my twelve years on earth! It's absolutely impossible to explain the incredible that Inception has. Inception is Sooooooooo dang exciting, edge of seat, mind blower, and I wish there were more movies like it and more Christopher Nolans out there. Congratulations to the well deserved best director, writer, and producer of films (in my opinion). Also the acting is fabulous, everyone did an amazing job, and Leonardo was fabulous at explaining the dream concept. Also the CGI and effects are amazing. Go watch Inception because it is incredibly amazing in every aspect, and is my number one film of my twelve years on earth. Bravo to the Inception crew and wow at this fabulous movie!"
tt1375666,"There are those who seek to dive into your mind, take your secrets and whatever else they find, espionage, conspiracy, infiltration, skulduggery, through worlds that are all conjured, well designed. They've been asked to plant a seed, start an idea, change the course of an industrialists career, but it needs dreams within deep dreams, an architect to build the schemes, and the consequences, could be quite severe.Imaginative beyond words, elegantly crafted and constructed, presented and performed by legends of the screen with a great storyline that keeps the viewer constantly engaged and on the edge of their seat - what more do you want out of movies."
tt1375666,"Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3."
tt1375666,"I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i'll definitely do the same with Inception.Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that's hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won't happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren't all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it's not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan's latest masterpiece! My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!"
tt1375666,"I had the privilege of seeing this movie before it came out, and, like most of DiCaprio's films, it blew me away.Inception is a well-made movie, filmed in about 6 locations all over the world. The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult). The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It's great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you're thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show, it is worth every penny you pay. Truly unique, like nothing i've ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn't afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending."
tt1375666,"Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan's Inception, this really is not possible.This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus. I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness.I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didn't like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is just so hard not too.If you liked this review check out my new film blog: http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com"
tt1375666,"I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to ""The Dark Knight"", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film ""Paprika"" in the whole ""invading dreams"" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (""G.I. Joe"", ""Transformers"") or the exact opposite (""Doubt"", ""Invictus""). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where ""Inception"" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years.Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (""Avatar"" be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort ""Shutter Island"". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (""The Dark Knight""). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And ""Inception"" can proudly stand alongside ""Blade Runner"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)"
tt1375666,"Inception is a beautiful piece of film that has impacted a large part of the film industry. With everything from the actors to the cinematography to the music, this movie without any elaboration perfected almost everything there is.Inceptions slow start is the only weak point of this movie. It begins intensely to then slows down for the next 20 - 30 minutes. While then finishing off as an impeccable film. Nevertheless, this is what brings the film down for me.The director Christopher Nolan managed to create a masterpiece with little to no mistakes. At no point during this intensely long movie did I feel bored. Instead, I was always excited and on my toes intrigued.The acting in this movie was phenomenal. A small number of great actors that all had their character arc while also doing incredible performances. It is truly beyond me how Dicaprio didn't win an Oscar for his performance.Meanwhile, also employing the greatest composer in history with Hans Zimmer, the music adds significantly. The music adds an extreme amount of excitement and keeps you constantly interested. Few composers can make you notice the music, but Zimmer succeeds per usual.To finish of the film was astonishingly shot. With beautiful eye-catching scenes. While also containing some incredible action scenes that might be some of the best action I've seen. With a thought-provoking storyline that finishes of with an unbelievable ending.I highly recommend Inception to everyone and I promise you won't be disappointed."
tt1375666,"Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" (2010) is a complex science fiction thriller about a group of people with varying specific skills that create a perfect team of dream-sharers. Dom Cobb, the main protagonist, is an extractor who is able to find out people's secrets by intruding into their dreams. His right-hand is Arthur, who researches and plans what they are trying to accomplish in a dream. Bright graduate student Ariadne is the architect for the dreams, meaning she literally constructs the physical aspects of a dreamscape. Eames is a professional at turning into anyone else in a dream, almost like shapeshifting. Lastly, Yusuf is a chemist who creates perfect concoctions of sedatives to achieve ideal conditions for the dreams to take place. This elaborate combination of characters is asked by a rich businessman, Saito, to infiltrate his dying competitor's son, Robert Fischer's, dream and place an idea in his mind so that Saito's business can become more successful. Traveling through the layers of someone's mind and making them think of an idea on their own is what they call ""inception."" Cobb is dedicated to making this happen so that Saito can arrange for Cobb's return to America to see his children. Without Saito, Cobb would not be able to return to America because of his alleged criminal background, but Saito has connections and power to clear his name. Some members of his team think achieving inception is impossible, but Cobb convinces them to be on board and they must come up with a mastermind plan with no room for error to achieve this extremely difficult yet imperative task. They begin a three-layer plan that involves elaborate depths of the dream dimension, taking advantage of Fischer's sensitive and dysfunctional relationship with his father, practiced methods of leaving a dream and entering the next, all while trying to avoid Cobb's wife Mal who lives in his subconscious and often sabotages his plans. The shocking ending leaves viewers at a cliffhanger and fans theorizing.Now that I've gone over the plot, let's talk about the other components of the film. The marketing strategies did an excellent job gathering hype for the film. The movie poster features the famous actors that everyone was excited to see, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Elliot Page, and the rest of the dream crew. It also says ""Inception"" in a large red font and notes that is directed by the same director of ""Dark Knight,"" which was an insanely successful and highly rated movie that was premiered two years prior to Inception. Dark Knight scored a 94% on rotten tomatoes and is #112 on IMBD's most popular movie list. This likely drew in the audience from Christopher Nolan's movies and set a high expectation for the quality of Inception. Another great marketing move was the contents of the teaser trailer. The trailer features a brief voiceover of Leonardo DiCaprio and amazing scenes with impressive cinematography taken out of context that show the viewers the production value and exciting action contents of the film all while confusing them so that they go see the film when it is released. I think the shock factor and science fiction aspect of the trailer is owed to the scene where a city block starts to fold over top of itself.The content of the film stayed true to the marketing because the cinematography, directing, and acting is quite well-done. Starting with the cinematography, the zero gravity scenes and cityscape building from the ground up were very realistic looking and intensified the movie watching experience. There was a lot of attention to detail. The directing of Inception is very montage based. It draws amounts and amounts of suspense. For example, the montage near the end of the film with the van, the fortress, and the hotel was painfully long but created such thick suspense. For the acting, I only have compliments and no complaints. Inception was casted beautifully and everyone fit their roles perfectly. Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job as Dom Cobb, especially in the emotional scene with his wife and two kids in one of the dreams. My personal favorite performance was Cillian Murphy's role as Robert Fischer. He played as his character really well and he captured his relatively constant sadness surrounding his father situation.Inception is a staple film in the science fiction genre and is similar to a few other sci-fi movies as well. Inception is at #135 on IMBD's most popular movie list and has a rating of 87% on rotten tomatoes, so there is no doubt about its quality. In my opinion, Inception is pretty similar to the well-loved movie ""The Matrix"" (1999) starring Keanu Reeves. They are both iconic science fiction and action films with themes of alternate realities. The second film I think is very similar is a more recent film, Tenet (2020) with Robert Pattinson. Tenet is also about bending the rules of science and is also directed by Christopher Nolan. If you enjoyed either of these movies, I recommend Inception. I also recommend it to general fans of Christopher Nolan's directing, so if you have watched and enjoyed any of his films, you would probably like Inception too.On my rating scale of one to five, with one being the worst possible score and five being perfect, I give Inception a five. It has no weaknesses in my opinion. Every aspect of this movie combines into perfection. The acting and cinematography is what takes it over the top, and I am a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and Cillian Murphy in all of the roles they play. This is a movie I have voluntarily watched multiple times and it only gets better with each watch. It is very complex and a complete experience to view. My favorite aspect of the film is the ending. Many people say they hate cliffhangers, but I enjoy them because it leaves it up to the audience to imagine. Basically, you can choose your own ending based on what you think makes the most sense with the facts you are given in the film."
tt6042648,"No, this film did not operate on a big budget or have nationally known talent in the film. Yes, this film has real people facing real challenges and dealing with real issues in life. You will see some really ""stand out"" talent, very well done cinematography, a story that communicates well the struggles people face and how they receive deliverance and hope in their lives. No one is so low that God cannot bring them up and out of the darkness. It's a really good film that the family can see and benefit from. On an added note it would also be a really good movie for youth groups to see as there are wonderful lessons that can be learned from ""A Second Chance""."
tt6042648,Once again the director of this movie brought issues from real life into this picture and into your home. At first I thought these girls should be in juvenile hall and receive some tough love. But instead they are left to God. To see these girls go from one extreme to another was truly very emotional. It shows the miracles God can do if you just believe and put your faith and life in to God. As always the faith in God shows that the director truly loves God and is putting the word out that all you have to do is believe. As always this directors movies are in my collection. I have shared all of them with family and friends.
tt6042648,"I had the great pleasure of attending a church screening of A Second Chance. My dates were my mom and my soon to be 12 year old nephew.
The plot was simple enough. Three bad girls tangle with the law before putting their past behind them. More unique is the victum and their judge.
It could have been a story of juvenile detention, but what we have is a seemingly leniant sentence. I thought the judge was off his rocker. :)
What we see are bad girls who lack all compassion, respect or even human decency. They were more bully and thug like than simply misguided youth.
Call it faith in God or intuition, the judge trusted them to more or less find their redemption. With a little steering from above, they do just that.
From the opening fire sequence, we were all pulled into the film. My nephew was glued to the screen. I found myself thanking him for being a good kid. 
As their stories unfold, you find their families are misguided. And I started to think that I may have been too harsh in my judgement of them. 
From there, I will leave the heart breaking journey and emotional roller coaster to you. And it is truly both."
tt6042648,I cant find this movie anywere and the places I can find it do you have to pay for it even on the TV I was just wondering if there is how to watch this movie I was born and raised in Terre Haute Indiana and we need more of that around here if the movie is what I hear about.
tt6042648,I loved this movie it was very well written and all the actors were amazing. It has a great story and love the way that the writer included GOD in this movies. DCTF are simply the best movies. I believe this film should be seen in theaters there is a need for more movies like this nowadays. All the actors were great they did awesome work.I'm glad I have a copy of this movie in my library. I feel that this movie should be shown to high school kids so they can make better choices.I love DCTF they are the best movies. Please consider making it available for everyone to watch it has a great impact.
tt6042648,"This film is nothing less than my title, Phenomenal! The story line is great, the messages are great, the lessons learned are real!
The heart felt moments are real!For anyone that is not directly related to the film or Dreams Come True Films for that matter, and are simply just a viewer, I have to tell you that there is an indescribable amount of passion, heart and soul put into this movie by all that is involved. I am not only privileged, but honored to know and have met most of the amazing people involved in the creation of this film! I would encourage you to give this film a chance, because it will not need a second one.When you finish, I would also encourage you to view some other great movies by Dreams Come True Films. I would also encourage you to take it one step further! Share this experience with someone! Encourage them to give this film a chance.Finally, since this is a faith based film....Just like the girls on movie ....
When your Hope has VANISHED, just remember even God can hear CRIES UNHEARD, and he will always keep THE PROMISE to forgive and love you unconditionally!God Bless!"
tt6042648,"This is a well made, award winning, independent, Christian film about three young women who, because of some trouble they got into, appear before a Judge who rather than sentence them to jail, sentenced them to perform a good deed, preferably for a stranger. The film then divulges into three stories of how each girl finds their way to our savior and their rectitude. The writing, directing, music and acting are second to none. This is a must see film for any young adult. It shows compassion. It shows that life can change with that compassion and a second chance. Show this to your children, they will thank you for it!"
tt6042648,"Such a great movie...the story follows teens with real life issues, very relatable, easy to follow and at times very emotional. I Highly recommend watching this film, especially with your teens!! There are a lot of coachable moments that can be used to help your teen through real life struggles and challenges. The issues also relate to adults though and how you can best work through challenges that your teen may be having. This film is not a high budget film but is still extremely well done. The story is top notch, great directing and even though the actors are not big names they still do a great job. Check out this film!!"
tt6042648,"Three girls are given a second chance at being productive members of society by the very person they 'wronged'.Coming from challenging home situations, each of the three girls overcame the stigma of being arrested and went forward with their lives to appreciate forgiveness and learned to forgive.Candy Beard and Daniel Beard once again prove themselves to be wonderful writers and directors.Working with local authorities to make each scene realistic and believable just adds to the integrity of the storyline.The cast and crew give of their talents to make this a most memorable and rewarding experience that makes all who see it appreciate the opportunity to re-do mistakes and improve the quality of life for all those around them."
tt6042648,"This is my first time with an IMDb account. I have been a long time fan of Dreams Come True Films. So I plan to review all of their films that I have seen. I am a resident of the Wabash Valley (in Indiana) where most or all of their films were produced.Writer, Candy Beard and Director & Cinematographer Daniel Beard make an incredible team. Let's start with the drama A Second Chance. It is a fantastic film that tells the story of 3 teenage girls from the wrong side of the tracks. This film is full of twists and turns. You'll laugh and you'll cry so get your popcorn, a drink and a box of tissues and get ready to enjoy one of the best movies to come from the independent film world. Fun fact, this is a multi award winning film, and I highly recommend it."
tt6042648,"Take a chance to see A Second Chance. This is the story of misguided youth, overwhelmed parents, actions that deserve consequences, and The Grace that turns it all around.I would show this movie to every young person trying to navigate this weird condition called life.A cautionary tale about, pride and poor choices. With stepping stones along the way for those kids that learn from others mistakes.If you are; a parent, a grandparent, a young person, a pastor, a teacher, an aunt, an uncle, struggling to fit in, struggling to figure it out, wondering if it gets better, wanting to see redemption instead of ruin, in a pickle, out of favor, running scared, full on ferrel, or just figuring it out, this is your movie!Seriously, this one's For You!I can say with absolute certainly, that this film was made with you in mind.I happen to know that every frame was specifically mapped out to touch you, to teach you, to reach you and to help you see a way out of whatever predicament you may find yourself in. To bring awareness and hope into your mind and let it trickle down to your heart.Dreams Come True production company is in it for the Truth.

tt6042648,"Very well done. Acting , videography. Kudos. To all. Well written scripts. That had me crying and pulling for them to straighten up. Everyone deserves a second chance. This film shows what love and littje compassion will do. Must see. Thus needs to be on pure flix. Netflix. Lifetime. Hallmark. We need good films to watch. To show our children and not be ashamed. This is definitely one I proudly own and have watched numerous times. Needs to be shown in prisons. And other places I feel. Kudos to candy beard for another winner. But I feel this is my favorite by far."
tt6042648,"This movie is pretty self explanatory and life lessons are learned by many. I was thoroughly into this movie from the get go. Had my popcorn ready and never left my seat. Having been familiar with movies from DCT films, I was not disappointed at all. Great acting and directing by all. Even saw a few familiar places and faces, which was quite a hoot. This movie is a GREAT family go to and most will learn a thing or two. Families just aren't the same as back when most of us were younger. Tough love was never used back in my youth. Nowadays parents just need to stand and unite and try to make a better world for the next generation. These types of movies are a step in the right direction."
tt6042648,I searched everywhere and couldn't find where I can watch/rent. I'm not a single parent but I'm going through things with my son so it looks like it would be a good one to watch.Not sure why so many movies are so hard to find.
tt6042648,"Here's another great film by Dreams Come True Films. I really can't get enough of their movies because the writer knows how to pull at the heartstrings of the viewers. It really does not matter if you are male or female, young or old, or somewhere in between, everybody in the audience can relate to this screenwriter. She writes real stories, raw stories, and it is so apparent that she does not shy away from hard to talk about topics.Because I am from the Wabash Valley where these films were produced, I've pretty much seen all their movies because they make them all open to the public during premieres and screenings. They have covered such topics as domestic violence (their very first film, WOW!) They have covered child abduction, child abuse, racism, bullying, suicide and now teen delinquency with A Second Chance.Even though this film was meant to teach a great lesson to teenagers who are out of control, there were some very precious and tender moments within this film and there were some comic relief moments as well. Every parent, IMO should sit down and watch this film with their teenagers. You won't regret it. A Second Chance is a beautiful story about second chances."
tt6042648,"In addition to being a great movie for the whole family, I thought the script was well written and the characters well-portrayed. This is a well-thought out Christian film which espouses good values. It's a rare thing these days for sure. In seeing the very real-life situations the characters find themselves in, I thought the movie was quite realistic. Additionally, I'm sure these are new actors/actresses given the film being independent, but it's clear they have a great deal of talent. All in all this film is most definitely worth a watch, particularly if you're a church family who's become wary of secular films."
tt6042648,"It's hard to believe this film was put together without a huge budget.The actors cast for each role were perfect fits. Cinematography on point and the music selection is excellent. The hardships, tragedies and successes these folks endure are heartbreaking and breathtaking at the same time and completely relatable to every day folks like you and me. From the opening credits to the ending credits, I laughed and cried with these characters. I felt their pain and their joy every step of the way. If you have not seen this film already, then you are missing out on a wonderful story indeed. This is a must see for the whole family."
tt6042648,"It's hard not to find topic in this phone you can relate to. The struggles of single parenting. Teaching your teenage children to have integrity, to do the right thing even when nobody's watching. Forgiveness. What do you do when it's family members that have hurt you? Sex. Drugs. ( No Rick and roll though. 😉 )
The characters in this movie all I have one thing in common: their individuals struggles are too difficult to handle on their own. Sometimes in life you need a nudge, sometimes you need a friend, sometimes you need a parent who loves you too much than to let you make poor choices. Sometimes you need a second chance."
tt6042648,"I loved watching A Second Chance!!! The writing, editing, music and acting all set the stage for a wonderful movie about the power of changing our lives. A great Christian and family film!!! All teens should see this film as it shows his we all have consequences and can truly change with the right support!!! The three teens in this movie gave great performances and were able to show both sides of themselves so well and the supporting cast was great!!! This movie would be a great tool for youth groups to use!!! I loved everything about it and hope that everyone will have the opportunity to see this jewel for themselves!!!"
tt6042648,"In this touching indie film, three young girls find themselves entangled in the wrong side of the law, setting off a journey of self-discovery and redemption. While the production may lack the polish of big-budget blockbusters, it more than compensates with its genuine storytelling and heartfelt performances. As the girls navigate the consequences of their actions under the watchful eye of the law, they embark on a path of transformation that extends beyond mere penance.Each girl's encounter with strangers in need serves as a catalyst for profound personal growth. From the poignant tale of a homeless man burdened by a past tragedy to the spiritual awakening experienced by another, these interactions weave a tapestry of empathy and understanding. Amidst their trials, the film delicately explores themes of forgiveness, sacrifice, and the resilience of the human spirit, leaving a lasting impression on both characters and audience alike. Heartwarming and sincere, this indie gem is a testament to the power of redemption and the capacity for change in even the most unlikely circumstances."""
tt6042648,"I was able to see a screening of this film. It kind of takes you on a roller coaster of emotions as you can't help but feel righteous anger towards some characters, but then, when you learn their back story, you realize why they are a mess. There is inspiring relief as you see how certain characters experience life-changing redemption as they experience compassion and learn, unwillingly at first, to show mercy and compassion themselves. Young people, especially will relate, but there is a message we all need. Keep an eye out for a homeless character who is played brilliantly. His performance was one of the best in the film."
tt0353049,"Chappelle's show is absolutely one of the funniest television shows I've ever seen! Dave is a flat out genius! I've never laughed out loud so much at one show in my life! There's literally not one episode that's not hilarious. I've watched every episode several times over and laugh just as much every time. Like many others here have already said, it's an absolute travesty that it only went for three seasons. It's not because it was canceled because it was one of the most popular shows on at the time, it's just that Dave didn't want to do anymore for some reason. Chappelle is one of the funniest comedians of this era and this is peak Chappelle at his best."
tt0353049,"Chappelle's show is a sketch-comedy show starring if course, Dave Chappelle. He also performs a stand-up routine as he shows you the clips and usually ends with a popular musical act. This is absolutely one of the funniest shows in the history of television! I've never laughed out loud so much at one show in my entire life! It's just a shame it only went two seasons because Dave lost his mind for a little while after Season 2 and didn't want to return for another season even though they offered him record amount of money at the time. This show debuted almost 20 years and it's just as funny today as it was then. Not many shows hold up after 20yrs but this is absolutely one of them. It's one of the best comedies of all-time!"
tt0353049,"Charlie Murphy narrating his time with Rick James, never laughed so much"
tt0353049,"I don't usually comment on things, and spend more time reading and seeing what others have to say, but I think Dave deserves more praise.I just got season 2 on DVD and it has been nonstop laughter since I put it in. There were several times when I had to pause the show because I couldn't breathe.I almost died when the grenade came rolling into the house in the skit that showed what would happen if Enron execs and similar were treated like true criminals.It's bad that I like the show so much. Sometimes i bust out laughing at work and people think I am insane (which I probably am) On another note, I hope things can be worked out for season 3. If this is the end of the show, then I thank Dave for giving us what he has and I wish him the best."
tt0353049,Dave is funny and controversial but always left me in stitches. I finally was angled to watch all of the episodes. It was sad that he left but the comeback has been epic
tt0353049,"I've seen the whole series probably 10-12 times all the way through with certain sketches so many more times over. I haven't seen it in a few years, and my gf had never seen it (how that happened, I don't know, I blame her parents). So we hunkered down for a Saturday, blazed some Laughing Buddha, and watched it all the way through. She said she understands why I am this way.Chapelle Show is genius, pure and simple. Chapelle himself has been a little annoying with his holier than thou, try and cancel me attitude. That aside, this show is still relevant, still hilarious. Do yourself a favor, watch it. Whether it's the first time or the 40th time, it's amazing."
tt0353049,"Brilliant, clever, irreverent, incendiary, thought-provoking, comedy.A show full of skits and stand-up, hosted by and starring Dave Chappelle. The skits are incredibly original, intelligent, left-field and funny, often covering topical issues like race relations, drugs, personal relationships, Prince and Rick James...Very edgy, and clearly for the open-minded. If you're a bigot and/or easily offended, best to not watch it...Pick of the skits, for me, would be from S1 E1 - Clayton Bigsby, the black White Supremacist. He's blind... Not only funny but also shows the irrationality and absurdity of racism."
tt0353049,"While ""Chappelle's Show"" was occasionally uneven (which is true of any skit comedy show), the successful skits easily predominated. But the reason I liked the show so much was because it was so brave and honest--particularly when it came to race. Chappelle's program was the only show on television that talked openly and honestly about race--something ALL folks need to do in this ultra-politically correct world. But even more importantly, these supposedly offensive skits were hilarious and worked. Plus, no one I know felt offended by them--particularly the wonderful skit about the blind black man who hated blacks because he didn't realize he was black! Another great one was his getting the seemingly white bread Wayne Brady on his show for an insanely funny skit! Brave...and insanely funny. Probably NOT a show for kids but wonderfully entertaining."
tt0353049,"Dave Chappelle has a very direct style of comedy that will put some people off. He confronts racial and political issues in America with a very unapologetic tone and never shies away. He has better commentary than a lot of serious, ""professional"" commentary!"
tt0353049,Saw Chappelle's first HBO comedy half hour back in the day. New he was going to be huge. This show was hilarious. Watch the Sam Jackson beer skit and you will know if this was for you.
tt0353049,"This short lived television program dramatically pushed the envelope on.what was culturally and socially acceptable to show attack on television. Chappell understand human nature. He understands race issue from both sides of the aisle and he understands comedy. While he is a great stand up and storyteller he is also a great sketch comedy actor and impressionist. This show has so many funny, over the top sketches it is always hard to believe he got ways with all he did at the time. Groundbreaking. Cutting edge. Dare I say brilliant week after week b."
tt0353049,"Chappelle is just a very smart guy Most sketch comedy shows are hit and miss. Kids in the Hall and SNL in its prime in the late 80s and early 90s are the closest that shows have come to the hilarity that is Chappelle's Show. Only Chappelle can turn an already legendary figure Rick James into a whole new level of legend, absolutely REAM R. Kelly, beautifully spoof both Law & Order and the reality of white collar crime vs. Ghetto crime in one fell swoop, and after leaving the show, have a 2Pac skit that's easily among the best skits he's ever done solidify his legacy (notice the tremendous irony in that?!). There is no unwatchable Chappelle's Show episode...even if some skits aren't THAT funny, almost all of them are at least somewhat funny, and there's generally at least one very funny skit in each episode if not most or all of them. There's more than enough horrible entire shows of SNL, Mad TV, and Frank TV.Most shows start off weak before they hit their stride (most pilot episodes of shows are ironically pretty bad compared to the rest of their runs) but Chappelle had probably one of the strongest outlandishly funny pilots of any show ever (South Park is pretty close). There was no doubt that something special was going on right from the get-go, and Chappelle never failed to deliver.Some people would say perhaps it's best that the show didn't live a long life because most shows that have age like an old ballplayer still believing they can outplay everyone else. I think any true fan of the show would disagree...Chappelle has been a funny guy since back in the Robin Hood: Men In Tights and Half-Baked days and I'm pretty sure he would have still kept his knack for comedy for many more years if he kept the show going. Still, it's his show, his wish, and at the least we can thank him for 2 brilliant years and the extras that came afterward."
tt0353049,"Just criminally unfunny. Im irish so i guess allot of the humor is lost on me but allot of the offensive and down right racist stuff is not. I love dark humor but chappelle was never dark humor hes just down right bigoted and racist through and through.I have nothing against people who laugh at his jokes as hes good at what he does hes a good entertainer. That being said his ability to write comedy and the way he writes things in the most offensive ways possible its just cringe.My final notes are basically this, you can easily write comedy without trying to offend everyone and anyone it takes allot more skill but thats why my rating is so low. This entire show is basically cheap jokes made for one purpose to sling offense at minorities and blast racism."
tt0353049,"I just reviewed the two season DVDs, in anticipation of the third season (alas postponed), and I have concluded that this is the funniest show on TV in a long time. Yes it's a little too edgy and risqué for some people, but those aren't the people who I give a >bleep!< about anyway.It's not just Dave who does it all; he has a great cast around him (Ashy Larry may be one of my favorites), gets major names to drop in (Anthony Anderson, Mos Def, Wyclef Jean) and to stay (Charlie Murphy), and his longer-serving characters are no less valid than the fresh ones (Tyrone the crack addict).It is not for the uptight; it is not for the close-minded. What he pokes fun at is stereotypes, and that's a taboo for many people today. The barriers that political correctness attempted to break down over the last 15 years is exposed by Chappelle in 24 episodes, showing the truth behind the masks that we all wear. Those of us strong enough to handle it find him refreshing and downright hilarious. Those who don't will face the consequences as they manifest themselves in myriad other, humorless ways."
tt0353049,"Dyno- mite!
Can we please get this man a drink! Gad damn!
Dave chapelle at his finest, well at his earliest on screen sets. Dave you the man"
tt0353049,"After all the drama Dave got from his latest hit, The Closer, I decided to get the old DVD's out and watch again. Wow! I can't believe that his show ever got on air in the first place. He was so far ahead of his time! It's still relevant today and it still made me Laugh Out Loud. Dave really is the GOAT! If you just found Chappelle after all the Free Publicity the alphabet folks gave him and aren't familiar with his previous work, this is a MUST WATCH!"
tt0353049,"As shows like Mad TV and Mind of Mencia finally see their ends, one must look back on Chappelle's Show and wonder what comedy television would be like today if Chappelle didn't get burned out and leave the show. Believe it - Comedy Central wasn't paying him ridiculous money because the show was just good. It was and will always be LEGENDARY.Most sketch comedy shows are hit and miss. Kids in the Hall and SNL in its prime in the late 80s and early 90s are the closest that shows have come to the hilarity that is Chappelle's Show.

tt0353049,"The best sketch comedy show ever! The laughs never stop. I miss good sketch comedy shows. I found one online recently that's pretty good, but Chappelle's Sketch Comedy show was the best! I wish it would have gone on longer than it did."
tt0353049,"The biggest disappointment in television history is the that this show only really lasted 2 dang seasons! Probably the greatest sketch comedy show ever made, however brief, and unfortunately Dave couldn't handle it. The big wigs should be ashamed of themselves for not stepping back and letting him do his thing. As Chappelle said they came in while he was filming and he didn't like the way they were laughing at him, not with him. Keep hoping one day he will return but it will probably never happen."
tt0353049,"This is the most daring, out there, hilarious show on Basic Cable TV.Dave Chappelle has taken a bit of everything out there, put it in comedic sketches and has driven them off the cliff. Make no mistake, for the weak hearted, some of his sketches will offend some folks, but for the rest of us, this is one of the funniest programs of the new season. Comedy Central did ""good"" in presenting this guy a show.Some of my favorite drop dead funny highlights from his first season (and I rate as must not miss...) sketches are ""Ask a Black Dude"" with Mr. Paul Mooney, ""Ask A Gay Dude"" with Mario, the ""Pop Copy Training Video"", ""The Real World"" spoof (Which is the most funniest spoof I've seen on this EVER!), the ""Pretty Woman"" spoof of 'if these movies were real life', the really out there ""FrontLines"" spoofs (The Hollywood animal one and the backwoods writer one are to die for!), the ""World is Comming to an End Presidential Press Conference"" and...the ""Reparations"" spoof had me on the floor in laughter.I sure hope Comedy Central remembers to turn in some of these to Emmy Voters, they are funny -- I cannot wait to see Chappelle present more of this in additional seasons."
tt0353049,"Dave Chappelle is a genius. He takes racist stereotypes and skewers them in the funniest ways imaginable. Some critics say he is too foul mouthed and crude, but walk into any middle school in America and you'll hear 11-year-olds saying worse stuff than he does. Dave is a brilliant comic and it's a shame this hilarious show didn't last longer. If you've never seen it, SEE IT!! Some of the best sketches:""Black Bush""- Dave imagines what it would be like if President Bush was black. The part about the UN was superb.""Trading Spouses""- Trading Spouses has gone interracial with hilarious results!""World Series of Dice""- Live from the Marcy Projects in Brooklyn, New York!""Clayton Bigsby""- oh my goodness, BREAHTAKINGLY HILARIOUS!!! How did Dave think of something so clever, so perfect as a blind, black white supremacist?""The Mad Real World""- that was so funny I was in tears. ""The Niggar Family""- a hilarious and surprisingly insightful look at racial epithets""True Hollywood Stories"": the Rick James one is hilarious, but the Prince one is really funny, too, especially if you are a Prince fan.And the best of all:""The Racial Draft""- the funniest thing I've seen in a long, long time. Watch Chappelle's Show and you won't be disappointed!"
tt0353049,"The Chappelle is just brilliant. Especially Season 2. I was hard pressed to find a skit that I didn't throughly enjoy. Its timely humour combined with timeless social commentary. The musical guest appearances where amazing. I really enjoyed performance by Kanye West and Common. I didn't the any of the skits form the ""Lost Episodes a.k.a. what was supposed to Season Three"". Don't get me wrong. Charlie Murphy and Downell Rawlings are very funny. They are great character actors that are part of a brilliant ensemble cast but only Dave Chappelle can really do these skits just with his monologues. I am not a fan of the way the media seemed to portray Chappelle as having a emotional breakdown because he couldn't handle the pressure. This was how it seemed to be spun to me. Chappelle was given a boatload of money by Comedy Cental for season three. Chappelle went to Africa because he ""crazy"". Give me break. This show stands on its own. I really believe that he didn't walk away from his show because of the pressure. I think he betrayed philosophically by a number of people around. Especially Comedy Central. That is why he felt that he had to make ""Block Party"". To explain his actions to his fans. Isn't about brand extension or merchandising? Its about people. A connection between himself and his fans. His material spoke to me personally. Made me think. He could really mix it up. He wasn't one dimensional in the sense that he would strictly use stand-up comedy or throw in a random joke here and there to ""spice things up""."
tt0353049,"Stop mentioning this show as a milestone. It's barely good at it's time. Really, it's not that funny, let it go already. Most of the comedy is about being black. And I get it, that's part of it. But still, it's not that funny. Stop saying on each bad Netflix special about how you left Chappelle show. It was easy. It was crap."
tt0353049,"This guy [see above] must be higher than Dave was on Half-Baked. Chappelle's Show is not only funny, but it's smart and irreverent too. When some people see it as sophomoric, Dave embraces that only to make fun of them. Look beneath the sometimes low-brow humor and you'll probably find a deep sociological statement. It must be funny to a lot of people because Dave just got PAID! I hope they can keep the show at the level it is now because it is simply hysterical, and the bits with Paul Mooney are brilliant. Richard Pryor himself watches the show and enjoys it, and if the funniest man ever likes it, Dave Chappelle must be doing something right."
tt0063929,"I still need to see more of Monty Python's Flying Circus to make my un-official official declamatory mandated professional amateurish stated opinion on this, but this is quite the nifty little show they put on back in merry old England. A lame joke I tried for at Python humor, but really, once you see the show, and see at least a few episodes, you'll know whether it's the right kind of intelligently un-hinged absurdity for you. I didn't warm up to it at first, I thought it was maybe too smart, in a way, through its silliness to be taken much seriously, as the jokes are not of the common kind. But after getting in through the films, and seeing many a varied skit with the guys, I'm looking forward to seeing (and being able to quote to other people) the best they got.It's partly a stream-of-consciousness style show thanks to Terry Gilliam's spectacularly crude animations (through cut-outs mostly, and spoofing either classical paintings, architecture, movies, and of course dancing teeth), part social satire through various skits of people going into shops (Parrot), jobs, arguments (want to argue about an argument), the police, criminals, movies, sports, old ladies, politics, and other sorts of good diddies on all things in life. There's also the most random bits of comedy ever to come out of the 20th century, and I can only think of the basic things that might have you wanting to check it out. I love short skits, like the classic fish-slapping bit (there comes the BIG fish, heh), and over-the-top voices (Michael Palin, I think, does some of the best ones, like an introduction he does to a skit that reminded me of one of the voices in the Holy Grail trailer), and deranged costumes, and the richness of the silly dialog. Sure a skit might not hit the mark, but then I could them come back to it days later and be laughing about things not laughed at the first time around. There aren't too many, if much at all, conventional punchlines- the brilliant stuff comes in the random barbs that shoot up in the lines and the deliver, in a look that Cleese or Chapman might give at one point or another, or the lack of something that ends up coming around later in the bit, or maybe not. There's absolutely no shame in how tasteless some of this can get, be it with topical issues or just the little things everyday we tend to take for granted, but a tasteless sensibility without any net to fall on that's appealing. And, of course, the Lumberjack song and ministry of silly walks and . Bottom line, if there could ever be one with Flying Circus, if you think it's just stupid little goofy gags and skits going on, watch out for how rich the words fly out (err, in Circus-like fashion) the mouths of the Pythons. It's the mightiest heap of the inspiration-turned-ludicrous comedy to be found on any TV show. Other favorite skits: 'Most Awful Family in Britain', 'Self-Defence Class', 'Word Problem', and 'Kilimanjaro Expedition' among others."
tt0063929,"The original sketch comedy show that has a very deserved cult following.It's... hilarious. It's... absurd. It's... very hard to describe, because it is so freakin' random! Almost every little sketch takes such bizarre twists and turns into something completely else that you'll literally never see it coming. Terry Gilliam's innovative, and equally absurd, animations are no different in their appearances between sketches. Often serving as transitions, but really this is just one side-splittingly funny compilation of sheer absurdity.Poking fun at just about everything that you could possibly imagine - talk shows, courts, daily life, the Spanish Inquisistion, the military, etc... - and it is all put together in a way no less random. Skits end unexpectedly, some shots are used many times, random characters appear only to speak one line, and all that makes for what is quite possibly the best crafted presentation of absurdity and chaos ever made. 10/10Not Rated and suitable for most viewers, but very cautious parents will undoubtedly object to the crude humor."
tt0063929,"""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" is a blast. Plain and simple. Seeing an episode will cause the following symptoms: Laughter, tears, jaw aches, voice-loss(all of above caused by laughter). Most will laugh, some will just sit there at its silliness. Well whoever you are, give it a try. You either love it or hate it. Me? I love it.10/10"
tt0063929,"Brilliant, innovative comedy. Possibly the greatest comedy series of all time. Certainly the most influential, iconic and quoted.Season 1 was great, but not their best. Still experimenting and finding their feet, it had some great sketches, but nothing as iconic as what was to come.Season 2 was where they really hit their straps. Most of their well-known sketches are from Season 2: Piranha Brothers, Ministry of Silly Walks, The Bruces, Spam, The Spanish Inquisition, Scott of the Antarctic.Season 3 was more of the same.Season 4 was where they tapered off. John Cleese had left and the creativity just wasn't anywhere near the levels of Seasons 2 and 3. No wonder it was only 6 episodes.Timeless comedy that has become embedded in culture. It's that big, brilliant and important."
tt0063929,"The legendary Monty Python group present one of the most iconic and fondly remembered sketch shows ever. Silly and genius at the same time it has a unique sense of humor which at some places has a serious note addressing the modern problems that every society faces, but it is at it's core pure and silly fun! You have countless sketches that are beloved by audiences all around the world, which, it seems, get even more popular as the years go by. Hilarious, entertaining, surreal, cheeky, silly, absurd... It can be called all of the above, but one thing it can't for sure: boring."
tt0063929,"The Brits are a stuffy, haughty and quite socially conservative. Their taste in own a entertainment is strictly high brow. They are quite reserved in their socializing, and always maintain the most highly dignified behaviour. They never miss their afternoon Tea Time.WHAT?!?!?!?! Well, these qualifications seem to be rampant, far-flung and long lasting. It is very hard to dispel and correct any untruth (Lie!) after it has been spoken, printed, published, recorded or transmitted over any medium, be it Smoke Signals, Carrier Pigeon, Drums or even by casting ""SEND HELP"" bottled-notes into the Oceanic System.If there were any true believers out there, they surely haven't seen any of the ½ Hour episodes of MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS. All it would take would be one show to dispel and negate any of these ridiculous stereotypes. Two Shows would get a viewer sort of interested; Three and you're starting to get the general idea; Four qualifies you as a Fledgling Anglophile and Five Show, you're hooked.Seriously though, we would never attempt to tell you or anyone else that X is funny,Y is not and unless you agree with me, there must be something wrong with you. Judging comedy is a most subjective art and too much analyzing of a Comedy, can be harmful in rendering it no longer as being funny. Either it makes us laugh or it doesn't There's certainly not any special brain power to it; and certainly, Rocket Scientists would have no advantages in judging what is funny. Some have a great sense of humor, in others their sense of humor is greatly and there are those in every walk of life who are completely devoid of any funny bone at all.When the folks at the BBC, like Ian MacNaughton, made the overtures to bring 5 of their top writers together under the umbrella of a TV Series to be patterned along the lines of THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS, or just TW3 for short. The roll call read like a true All-Star Dream Team of scribes. The list read as follows: The team of Graham Chapman & John Cleese, Writing Partners Terry Jones & Michael Palin and Solo Act, Eric Idle. The addition of the Popular Animator, the American, Terry Gilliam just acted as the final touch needed. It was like a butter cream frosting being put on a 5 layer German Chocolate Cake.With a all of the resources of the British Broadcasting Corporation at available and what certainly appears to have been a more than adequate budget at their disposal, the series was launched. Like any young undertaking, It took a little while to shake down the loose ends and see what adjustments would be needed.One difficulty that they had was in choosing the Title of their new enterprise. All sorts of ideas were kicked around; for they were dealing with the outputs from six very fertile, creative minds. ""OWL STRETCHING TIME"" was a finalist in the big sweepstakes and the title does indeed appear in the closing of at least one episode.As for describing MONTY PYTHON, it is really no easy task. The sketch humor is full of such off the wall material, the likes of which, have never seen the light of day before. Additionally, the Episodes are so tightly edited and quickly and without warning, they can end one bit abruptly, only to return to the first and eventually mix them both or even start another skit.Various occupations are often targets for their razzing, as well as any and every of the old established British Institutions. The Parliament, The Royal Family, The World Wars, The British Class system, Sports, Politicos,etc. You name it and they've kidded it.They also maintain a close relationship with British Drama of years gone by. That is accomplished with their often used recurring of the nonsensical idiot character of ""Mr. Gumby"".As for picking a ""favourite"" episode, we can only offer those which contain some particular routines and sketches. That being the case, let us consider the following, outrageous skits, such as: ""The Ministery of Silly Walks."", ""Dennis Moore (the Highwayman)"", ""Inspector Dimm in Court"", ""The Dead Parrot Sketch"" and of course, last but not least ""The Lumberjack Song."" As for any disappointments, there have been very few and they were of little consequence. But there is one nasty fault that does make a big difference to the Series as a whole. In its last season, the line-up did not include John Cleese. Apparently his schedule at that time did not allow his presence. He was committed to some other project, like ""FAWLTY TOWERS"", for example. While there was probably much of his writing in that last season's product, THE PYTHONS greatly missed Mr. Cleese.The Pythons have been translated into other languages and they made a number of rather successful Theatrical Films. They continue to captivate those of new Generations, as well as the 30+Years viewer, just like yours truly. They even have that successful Broadway Show, SPAMELOT.God Bless Them for their successes in making us laugh and think at the same time; and obviously, he already has. But for all of the Films, The Broadway Show and other Live Appearances; it is on ""the old Tube"" that they are truly on their best."
tt0063929,"Skit comedies have always been my favorite kind of comedies because in them you just have unlimited creative freedom to not just be about anything but even to do anything you want.This show is one of my favorite TV shows of all time as well as favorite skit and comedy show of all time. It was revolutionary for it's time before skit comedy shows were even common, but what really revolutionized it was in it's execution of comedy where it dared to not play it safe and actually go the extra mile. To this day I'm still surprised they were able to get away with what they did; it's a little more common place now with the shows on the ""Adult Swim"" block on Cartoon Network but this was one of the first and still the best.The ensemble is great each of them are memorable comedic actors though my favorite one is John Clease he always had this infectious uptight manic mannerism to him. Each of them look as though their really into what their doing and having fun.I really like those brief animated segments which are beautiful but really odd art style, much like you would see in a surrealist painting as well as Mad Magazine. From the clouds, tiny men, giant feet, at times I wondered if the artists were on something. Even the pacing and editing is crisp, from how it quickly transitions and cuts to the next skit or the animated segment in between the skits, it really feels like a live action Mad Magazine as if were flipping between the pages.However what powers this show are the skits which are great and memorable. I'll just say a few that I really loved. Each of the skits are really colorful, creative, weird and may'be even a little risqué with the amount of absurdity and behavior they were really pulling all the stops out; for some of them I still wonder where the hell they came up with the ideas or what when through they heads when they made them. Their rich with both verbal and visual humor, there is just a lot of memorable quotes and dialog in the skits which I can't always say for all of them which is cool. The verbal humor is smart and clever but not to the point of being boring, they just go simply for doing one task and one only delivering the humor which most good skit shows should do.I won't say too much my words can't do them justice their the kind of things you have to see for yourself to laugh.The Deadly Joke: This just cracks me up because of how absurd an idea this is; instead of chem warfare it's punchline warfare.Race of the Twits: It's one of the most bizarre races I've seen in history. Each of the competitors are just idiots to the core and each of the obstacles they do are even more absurd and stupidly easy.The Spanish Inquisition: This is my favorite one of all where it is just absurdity at it's best; it's a Inquisition platoon that's not just out of place but out of time, as they are still operating on outdated laws. But most of all each of them are complete morons.Overall if your a fan of skit shows this classic is worth checking out, this circus flies high.Rating: 4 stars"
tt0063929,"I've talked to a gentleman from the UK who witnessed the original TV broadcast of Monty Python's Flying Circus. It has been a mind blowing experience. Although i've discovered it a couple of decades after the gentleman above, i can only share his feelings.There is no need to underline the importance of Monty Python's Flying Circus for today's comedy. After all, it has spawned several movies and innumerable copycats. It followed in the footsteps of the Marx brothers and absurdist comedy, for example Hellzaappopin' (1941) and unleashed talent in the comedy world and opened new fields of entertainment.The only criticism i might have is that it created a safe haven for semi-talented individuals who make whatever they want a name it comedy, in the similar way that surrealism influenced mainstream art of the twentieth century."
tt0063929,"It should come as no surprise that I've selected this show as the most influential and well known comedy series to ever be released, and how could I choose it as anything but? Even if you're one of the rare people that doesn't care at all about this show, you know about it either way. Monty Python would later spawn some of the most acclaimed comedy movies ever made, such as Holy Grail and Life of Brian, but before all that, there was the original cast of zany entertainers whose comedic style is so unique you really can't criticize it. Fans pick this show apart in great detail and talk about their favorite sketches, and which ones ought to be people's favorites but don't get the recognition they deserve (there's a lot of those). Pretty much everybody is aware of the spam skit, where a group of vikings are sitting in a cafe eating breakfast and a man and his wife want to order something, but the only thing for sale is spam or some variation of it. What makes it so funny is due to many reasons, but for one thing, the waitress is played by a man even though the character is clearly supposed to be a girl. The group of vikings dining in the cafe doesn't make any sense either, and only adds to the hilarity because the viewer can't make sense of anything. It's also interesting to note that the internet term for messages being repeated again and again (spam) came from this skit, because the repetitive use of the word inspired it. That's the influence this show has. This show is overflowing with moments like that, where you can't help but laugh because they're so well written. Even though Monty Python is easily the most recognizable comedy series of all time, it's not an exception to the low points. The show enjoyed a huge following with many dedicated fans, but like all good things it came to an end. The episodes undergo a dramatic drop in quality once John Cleese leaves, and this seems like a no brainer. Despite this, the show still remains funny to this day, and good jokes are as timeless as good writing. So while Monty Python no longer has the hype it once had 50 years ago, the hilarious skits and fine performances mean that it's not ready to be forgotten just yet."
tt0063929,"We interrupt the Internet Movie Database because it's gotten too silly! I've noticed a tendency for the IMDb to get rather silly. Now I do my best to keep things moving along, but I'm not having things getting silly. So, we present to you this exposé on the greatest comedy sketch show of all time! In it you will see: mosquito and ant safari hunters, the funniest joke ever written in which people die laughing and later used to attack the Germans during WWII, mountain climbers that see double, ""The Institute of Silly Walks"", hospitals that treat their patients like soldiers in boot camp, a world in which everyone is dressed like Superman except for the greatest hero ""Bicycle Repairman"", and of course the Spanish Inquisition that shows up when least expected! And like the existence of God, Monty Python was, is and ever shall be the Messiah of television comedy. All must genuflect at the altar of John Cleese's desk when he finishes his phone conversation at the beach and says ""And now for something completely different."" Sketch comedy shows on television existed long before Monty Python. In the US, the early sketch comedy shows, like ""The Milton Berle Show"", ""The Caesar Hour"" and ""Your Show of Shows"" were essentially vaudeville acts that were broadcast nation-wide, and often upon a stage. However, Monty Python may have been the earliest of the sketch comedy shows to utilize the fact that it was being broadcast on television which pushed sketch comedy out of the constraints of the fading sensibility of Sid Caesar and Ed Sullivan.In addition to their sketches which were filmed like little movies rather than on stages (and probably were not improvised), Monty Python's Flying Circus is filled with fake news broadcasts, fake commercial interruptions, spliced sequences of stock footage, and of course, the outrageously irreverent cartoons that spoofed the great art of Europe and created a surrealist python world where portraits of distinguished old men eat up the Venus de Milo -- whole! Monty Python spoofed everything, from their own BBC News, World War II to Queen Victoria who is shown in one sketch walking into a poetry reading with the coffin containing the remains of her husband saying ""My late husband and me..."" Almost every zany aspect of modern society were taken prisoner and held in custody by the Pythons, including courtrooms, shopping malls, and even little old ladies who have decided to form violent street gangs! And of course the French and the Scots seem to get a little more airtime than other groups! And the final aspect I will relate is that most of these zany sketches were presented with absolutely straight faces as if the actors were seriously engaged in their ludicrous exploits. There is very little I can add about Monty Python that hasn't already been said, except, that if you have never seen it, it is almost impossible to describe. So, for God's sake, see it! We now return you to the Internet Movie Database with its regularly scheduled programming."
tt0063929,"England's most famous comedy team made its name on its eponymous TV show, spoofing anything that could get spoofed, and has maintained a cult following ever since. John Cleese, Terry Gilliam (the only American member of Monty Python), Graham Chapman, Terry Jones, Eric Idle and Michael Palin depicted every possible wacky thing during their five years on TV -- namely the dead parrot and the Ministry of Silly Walks -- and in several movies since then.During the 2008 presidential election, there was an Internet meme saying that the wrong Palin got chosen as John McCain's running mate: it should have been Michael Palin because he's tough on terrorism (""No one expects the Spanish Inquisition!"") All in all, a great show! Aside from ""A Fish Called Wanda"" and ""Fierce Creatures"", another movie featuring multiple members of the team is ""Splitting Heirs""."
tt0063929,"The series was a landmark in television history and broke a number of taboos and boundaries. And there are scenes which have been and continue to be laugh-inducing, such as ""Ypres 1914"", ""The Ministry Of Silly Walks"", and ""The Spanish Inquisition"".But what really made Monty Python work was mainly not the jokes but the performances. If the actors hadn't been able to play everything straight, the whole thing would have fallen apart. The series depended not just on wit but on silliness and absurdity, which in itself isn't automatically funny. And many of the scenes are dated or funny only to Britons...and some of them are genuinely not funny. But not everything Charlie Chaplin was good either (and I'm talking about his early silent films as well as his late talkies.)"
tt0063929,"Monty Python is considered as a landmark TV comedy and in its way I suppose it is.
It's a show that I never got into the habit of watching even though I have an acute sense of comic absurdity.I tried watching occasional episodes but in all honesty I found it a bit hit and miss. Sketches started okay as original and off beat, and then fell flat, that's my impression of them.As an example of this I cite a strange reaction I had to a Monty Python sketch, one of the most famous the Dead Parrot sketch.
During this I made a cardinal sin of actually wondering why I was laughing, approximately half way through it. Once I'd got the notion in my bonce I couldn't dislodge it from my mind.This was the only time I was stupid enough to make this mistake. But the overall effect on me was to put me off the show.This attitude towards the TV program persisted regarding the Python films. Until their film Life of Brian, which is now my favourite film comedy.
Why did I change my mind over that film? Because there was so much stupid ill informed comment about it, that I had to watch it to see what all the fuss was about. I have now seen this film more times than any other film.Monty Python has however managed to achieve something that British comedies have in general failed, and that is to acquire cult status in the USA.
This has had a knock on effect
of an unwarranted assumption that esoteric comedy emanates from this show. I say this as any reference to Monty Python online elicits copious comments, that illustrate this point.
A typical example being to declare of Monty Python, that they are 'The Beatles of Comedy'.
Even this side of the pond the same feeling has permeated, that any originality in comedy emanated via Monty Python.
If your knowledge of comedy is so restricted then that may seem to be the case.
But for my part I'm not surprised that Spike Milligan got put out after watching Monty Python, when he declared ""They've nicked my stuff"""
tt0063929,"Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the silliness known as Monty Python's Flying Circus which plagues my television. The ""jokes"" are silly and pointless, and the sketches never have proper endings. I demand that this programme be removed from telly at once and replaced with programmes that are truly representative of the glories of British humour, such as Keeping Up Appearances and the BBC World News.Sincerely, Col. Arthur von Gambolputty-Dinsdale of Ulm (deceased) (Warning: This letter does not reflect the true feelings of the reviewer, who is a huge fan of Python and thinks that the above-mentioned gripes are the very reason that the show is awesome. The comedy still holds up after over 35 years, though several of the costumes and haircuts do not, and the mixture of zany oddball non sequiters, intellectual references and satires, and ingenious physical comedy makes Python something very special and unique. Viva Python! And remember, !las llamas son mas grande que las ranas!)"
tt0063929,"I remember as a boy seeing episodes of this running late on Sunday nights on PBS.
Like to so many other people it stood out to me as the greatest, funniest thing I'd ever seen.
And really I still haven't seen anything funnier or greater decades later.I can't imagine they did these with any idea they'd still be watched and beloved some fifty years later.
Yet that's whats happened.And As influential as their sense of comedy has been I think it's proven somewhat inimitable-
A testament to their uniqueness ."
tt0063929,"Absolutely fascinating, this humour is peculiar and never gets old or boring. I watch it now when I'm 18 and my uncle who's 50 years old watched it too. Very innovative and creative"
tt0063929,"Never before had there been such a show that had broken as many conventions on television as ""Monty Python's Flying Circus."" Looking at American television during the '60s, it seemed obvious which country was coming up with better comedy material. With shows like ""Not Only...But Also,"" ""That Was the Week That Was,"" ""Q,"" ""At Last the 1948 Show,"" and ""Do Not Adjust Your Set"" already in tow, it was Python that served as the true breakthrough for British television. Shows such as ""Saturday Night Live,"" ""Mr. Show,"" ""Mad TV,"" ""Family Guy,"" and ""South Park"" owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to ""Monty Python's Flying Circus."" The main strength of the show is that it mainly doesn't side too much with making topical comedy. Of course, there are moments where they satirize certain British figures (many of them I would have to look up to get the joke), but on the whole, it seems as if they start with a clean slate every time they make a sketch. There are absolutely no boundaries and no levels of expectation. It could be safe to say that they were at a complete advantage considering that they had free license to make sketches out of literally whatever came to mind at any given moment. With that, the possibilities were endless. The most unique factor of the show is the fluidity of each episode due to the stream-of-consciousness approach magnified by anti-climactic sketches that abandoned the pigeon-holing punchline and the innovative animation by Terry Gilliam. Each episode was as much a mind-trip as it was a comedy revue. Characters would sabotage sketches to make way for new ones, or a piece of animation would appear in a background and be zoomed in for a link to another sketch. It was all very cerebral and extremely innovative. Another important factor is the level of intelligence on the show. You don't feel like you're being dumbed down at all when you watch the show. At times, I actually learned something new from watching the show. I'd do a little research to better understand a sketch and find something very interesting that I would have never known about otherwise. Overall, the show is absolutely brilliant and it should been watched by more people, even though that will never happen. Monty Python is a comedy troupe that has more of a cult following than established fanfare. A lot of people can be put off by the genuine silliness of the show. As a whole, British comedy is actually much sillier than American comedy. Others find it just too strange and abstract. Of course, there are moments when one would be singled out because the humor is directed at British audiences a little too much. Nevertheless, there is usually one sketch at least that will get one laughing, and with that, its a good program to at least try out."
tt0063929,"I remember when I was 9 and my mom bought me ""Life of Brian"". I had no idea what it was and who the people in it were. But I have never laughed so hard at a movie before and even if I didn't understand all the jokes I loved it from the start.After that I started looking for more movies by Monty Python including ""Meaning of Life"" and ""The Holy Grail"". Then, my dad bought me the film ""And Now For Something Completely Different"" which is when I realized that they had made a TV-show. I didn't know where to get a hold of it since it wasn't for sale and was never aired on television(in Sweden).Then a few years ago they released it on DVD and I got it. What can I say, there are no words except for Brilliant! Fantastic! Hilarious! Spam! Unbelievable! and Awesome! The only complaint I have is for the fourth season in which John Cleese decided not to take part in. It's just not the same if someone's missing.It's a real shame that Graham Chapman died, otherwise I think they would have made some more films.R.I.P Graham Chapman and R.I.P. Monty Python."
tt0063929,"For me as well as for a great many other semi nerdy and amateur intellectual kids, Monty Python's Flying Circus was more than just another comedy show. It was a part of our academic and intellectual development, because mind you, Monty Python is by no means your everyday slap stick/fart/pie in the face humor (although they do feature an advanced and hilarious pie in the face sketch!) and is definitely not enjoyed by ""the masses"". They have served as an inspiration to many comedians and been copied by numerous others and will continue to be watched and enjoyed forever, in spite of the fact that the show is from 1969!"
tt0063929,"I first saw this show in 1981 when I was 10 because my mom thought PBS was airing a circus(bless her ignorance). The episode was the one with Scott of the Antarctic, the one where the lady runs down the beach and loses articles of clothing to cacti. I was hooked. Wacky comedy and scantily clad lady, a boy just starting puberty couldn't ask for anything more. By the time I was 15 I had seen most of the episodes, all of the films countless times(plus Time Bandits and Yellowbeard, which I saw in the theater), and owned half the audio tapes. My sense of humor was permanently warped.I've never tired of their antics, and if anything they've become funnier as I've aged. I'm extra greatful to these fellas, because without their comic genius we surely wouldn't have the brilliance of The Kids in the Hall and Mr. Show."
tt0063929,"It is hard to put into words how much I like the ""Flying Circus"". Born just some years after it was produced, I can still remember how my whole class at school watched a replay of it on German TV at the end of the 80s (it was fortunately not dubbed, just subtitled) and we were always re-enacting the jokes the day after... Fortunately we had teachers who were also into Monty Python, including our English teacher who let us watch their movies. Now, almost 25 years later, they continue to make me laugh. But having grown up and having become a little bit more educated now allows me to produce an even sillier interpretation of their work. The thought underlying everything they did was basically that 99,9% of the things we humans do is practically meaningless. May it be starting or following a religion (Brian), undergoing expert treatment (Confuse-a-Cat Ltd. - a brilliant sketch), politics (Silly Walks) etc. And what made them even better is that they also took on the past with WW2 (the deadly joke, Hilter in England) and their medium TV/cinema in itself. Brian kidnapped by aliens - an early parody of science-fiction, isn't it? All this combined with to-the-point acting, sharp observations and top-notch writing - they were decades ahead of their time. If this did not deserve a 10/10 rating, I would not know what else."
tt0063929,"It's.....""Monty Python's Flying Circus"". This show has too many memorable, priceless bits to count - and not a few duds. At their best, the Pythons invented a new language for comedy (and TV): anything goes, anything can happen, at any time and any place. It bends the mind. Perhaps as good a summary of their primary purpose as any can be found in a Graham Chapman line: "" we need to cure people of their sanity"". But sometimes they take an idea that's not very funny in the first place, and they stretch it out too long. The first two seasons are generally the strongest; the third is also good but more uneven; the fourth is by far the weakest (though it still has its moments) - their hearts and minds were more in the upcoming ""Holy Grail"" by that time. Objectively speaking, an episode like ""Mr. Neutron"" is as awful as ""The Spanish Inquisition"" is brilliant. But my single favorite episode has to be the early ""Ant - An Introduction"" - don't miss it! *** out of 4 as a whole. P.S. Carol Cleveland - what a WOMAN!"
tt0063929,"A gentleman (John Cleese) enters a pet shop and wants to register a complaint that the parrot that he had bought from that very boutique just half an hour ago was in fact a 'dead parrot'. The owner (Michael Palin) tries to convince him that the Parrot, a Norwegian Blue, was not really dead and was just resting. The argument continues and gets sillier and sillier until an army colonel (Graham Chapman) pops out of nowhere and stops the sketch abruptly because it was getting very silly. If this kind of humor doesn't interest you, read no further and plan on watching something else. But if it does and if you have not seen Monty Pythons Flying Circus you haven't seen nothing yet.Monty pythons pretty much invented and perfected their unique brand of humor which can be categorized as 'surreal'. One can argue that 'the Goon Show' was the archetype for Monty pythons, which is true, but then Monty Pythons took it to territories that had never been explored before. They created a world where you can get a government grant for silly walks or buy an argument in an argument clinic. A world in which a father and son could have the age old ""romantic vs. a simple coal miner"" argument, just that in this world the son is a regular coal miner whereas it's the father whose head is full of useless novels and poems. Just like the Beatles they took something and created something completely new out of it. The comparison is valid because Monty Pythons at their peak enjoyed the status of any of the rock stars in those days (including groupies) and the Beatles, George Harrison in particular, were their biggest promoters.Terri Gillian's stream of consciousness art work is pretty bizarre and holds all the sketches together. John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Michael Palin, Eric Idle and Terry Jones play all the characters (including women's) themselves with dead seriousness. This is insane humor at it's brilliant best."
tt0492472,"As a young father of 2 (both under 4) and also a cancer survivor who is 3 years + into remission...I think this film must be seen by as many people as possible.For those of you who have been introduced to cancer either by fighting it yourself or having a loved one (family member or friend) deal with the reality of ""life"" that this disease bestows upon us...or are a parent of a young child...watching this film will be hard and tears will flow...but hopefully after watching it you will come away with a renewed sense of love for those in your life and will quietly remind yourself what I hope you already know.If you have not been introduced to cancer or have not had the pleasure of being a parent...then be prepared to for a heart wrenching emotional journey that at its conclusion will hopefully have your heart and mind opened to their fullest extent...while most importantly giving you a reason to comprehend and bring forth into your own lives what those of us who have been touched by cancer or are parents of young children should already know...what the important things in life really are!"
tt0492472,"Usually when I've seen something this sad, afterward I have a sense of relief, and that my life just isn't so bad. This one was hard to recover from. I'm dumbfounded that some voters gave this 1 or 3, I just can't imagine not being moved to tears by the heartbreak contained in this film. I have to assume these were some of the folks who left before it ended at Sundance.I believe the purpose of art is to touch someone, to make them think, to make them feel. This does that in the most human of ways. I had second thoughts about whether I was up for this, but it was incredibly captivating. I had the luxury of having this on my DVR, so I could pause to rest and recover as needed, but at no time during the nearly 4 hours did I have thoughts of not watching it in its entirety. It is one of the finest documentaries I've experienced, one I will never forget."
tt0492472,"I first heard of this film on NPR, and I was intrigued based on the sole the fact that it's a documentary. (I'm a huge fan of documentaries.) Then I found out that it was playing on PBS and I got to watch it.This film is by far the most captivating film I have ever seen. The director(s) did a wonderful job of letting the story tell itself, and I appreciated the fact that they gave minimal commentary and just let the camera role. Sort of the ""fly on the wall"" perspective. They also did an amazing job in integrating the human element into the film as by the end of the film I felt I had a direct connection with every character in the film. I felt I was there with all of the children as they battled with cancer, and I felt for the families having to go through the battle that cancer is. It helped me deal with a lot of the pain I locked up inside when my family went through the same ordeal over ten years ago with my young cousin and later with my uncle. It was by far the most difficult film I have ever watched.Prior to watching the film I would often get into these meaningless debates about whatever on the IMDb message board as well as other ""blog"" sites, but after watching this film it made all of that seem trivial and thus a waste of time. The film forced me to get my priorities straight, and my respect for what the doctors, nurses, and volunteers do at the average Children's Hospital has increased five-fold.I believe everyone should watch this film because it brings a sense of reality. Sometimes we become too comfortable with our lives and forget about everyone else. It's a true reality check, and that's exactly what a documentary should always be."
tt0492472,"I watched it in two sittings since it was released on Netflix. A heart breaking documentary that goes though rollercoaster of emotions. You naively hope for the ""happy endings"" but life is not a Disney story. Prepare tissues."
tt0492472,"This is one of the greatest documentaries I have seen. It doesn't largely edit, or grey fact into fiction, manipulate truths, use music to dictate moods, no dramatic commentaries. It simply lets the camera roll and captures what documentaries are so supposed to do: record reality. I watched this in two parts as it is long and very exhausting emotionally. It is so sad. I didn't cry, I was a blubbering mess. My wife too. We looked at each other at various times during the series and we both had tears streaming down our cheeks. This has stayed with me through the years and I still think about it. It puts you right in there and confronts you with the awful reality that children still die from cancer."
tt0492472,"This documentary is one of the most incredible things I've ever seen. The way this is filmed is so real and raw. To see into the lives of the hospital as well as the families is heartbreaking yet so educating at the same time. Definitely watch this, it'll change a part of you"
tt0492472,"From the start of the movie, viewers are emotionally invested in the beautiful children whose stories are shared. Their personalities shine through as do those of their family members. Parents watching this movie will feel a common bond with the parents of Justin, Alex, Tim, Jen and Al as they dare to ask, ""What if it were my child?"" While some criticize things like the movie's camera angles, lighting, voice-overs, etc., I, an average viewer, thought it was beautifully done and very ""real."" Hopefully, seeing ""A Lion in the House"" will spur viewers to do research on childhood cancer and become a voice for the children. While great strides have been made in curing all kinds of cancer, many do not realize that very little funding is allotted specifically for childhood cancer research."
tt0492472,"When I was a child I spent years with my grandfather while he tried to battle cancer. I then spent a summer with him at 9yrs old while he lost the battle and my mother, his daughter, took on the role of his hospice nurse. I can only imagine what these parents went through, and the many parents who are currently going through it. This isn't just about the kids, but their whole family.Some of these reviews are atroc, especially the ones judging the parents. Imagine judging people who are trying to do their best while living their worst nightmare. This documentary spans years, and they call it amateur. So what if it is! It's honest. In a world full of instant gratification this documentary was instead a long journey, as it should be. Most people who give terrible reviews no jack all about filmmaking.This was honest, and beautiful, and heart wrenching and ugly. Ignore the 3 or less ratings, and take a chance on this."
tt0492472,It invite us to visit the universo of childhood cancer with proposal to make us debate. A sensitive work.
tt0492472,"Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar do an impeccable job of capturing five families whose children must fight cancer to survive and live. Justin has been fighting leukemia for ten years. His family like the others would travel anywhere to get him treatment. Alex is a lovely seven year old girl who is also fighting leukemia with her parents and sister. The directors had plenty of access to the families and the medical staff at Cincinnati Children's Hospital in Ohio. The film directors spent year filming and editing this documentary. The cameras aren't intrusive but shows the pain and anguish of the families. There are some light hearted moments like Justin's mother and stepmother getting along beautifully. Her husband joked that his ex wife and wife could be lovers. Next on Jerry Springer, it's nice to see them get along so well."
tt0492472,"While cancer is already a big problem, and children try to get rid of this trouble.. If you have children, I do not recommend watching it.. because you will rebel against everything!"
tt0492472,"I stumbled upon this film on a Roku channel and knew nothing about it before I watched it. I have a 4 year old son who just finished his cancer treatments. This was his second bout with cancer. My first thoughts were that it was amateurish. I watch a ton of documentaries and it seemed at first that this one was without direction. The audio was so quiet in parts it was a bit hard I follow. I had such high hopes for this. As cancer parents, we are furious over the fact that our childhood cancer receives almost no funding. And while the survivorship of childhood cancer is going up it is at a huge cost. There must be constant vigilance because of recurrence, secondary cancers, and late term effects (infertility, cardiovascular issues, cognitive delays, etc.) and that is a huge part that until your kid is diagnosed you're unaware of and it's unacceptable. Almost none of that was even mentioned. I would like to have seen more about the real toll it takes on families. It can devastate financially between massive bills and loss of income. Marriages fall apart. Many parents and children get PTSD. I do realize there are some limitations on what even the best documentary can do, but I certainly would have done it differently. I was very pleased that they didn't blow through what happens when a child dies of cancer. Cancer is not pretty smiling bald faces. It is ugly and cruel. It is not my intention to judge, but I was shocked to see the mom leave her dying son in the hospital alone for days at a time. In my experience that would not even be allowed. And I have little doubt she was in denial, intentional or not, about how dire his condition was. But I can't wrap my head around not visiting your son in the hospital or at least making sure someone is there. My heart broke for him being so scared."
tt0492472,"The documentary. Itself, was beautifully done. I was so angry, however, at some of the parents who put their children through needless suffering in order to postpone their own grief. Alex, in particular, comes to mind. She was such a delightful little girl, but her father tortured her with pointless treatments that did more harm than good, especially towards the end of her life. The oncologist who used her as a guinea pig to research new therapies should have lost his medical license."
tt0492472,"A Lion in the House has good intentions, but the filmmakers are timid in their approach. The wandering style used, with occasional voice-over gets really old long before the nearly four hours of the film ends. In a period when documentaries are in vogue, and breaking new ground in refreshing ways of telling stories, A Lion in the House seems like a throwback.The subject matter is interesting, and the filmmakers may be oversensitized to the subject matter, unable or unwilling to edit it down into a more dynamic film. It seems like they went into without a real plan, and having had experience with the subject matter, that makes it a shame.If they went into the editing room, they could cut out at least an hour, and make a film with more impact."
tt0492472,"I agree with those who say this film was very poorly done. It was a major letdown. I had heard about its Sundance accolades and that it was doing well at festivals but I was totally shocked at how bad it was when I saw it. This film felt like some tired old PBS throwback. The shooting wasn't all that great but I'm usually willing to overlook that if the story is really strong. It just wasn't, even though the subject is something that many people can relate to given that cancer is so prevalent in our society. I found myself feeling like I was in elementary school once again being forced to watch an ""educational"" film in class. Moreover, the filmmakers seemed to have almost no interest in showing any kind of conflict or emotion throughout it which felt to me like a bit of a whitewash. It seemed like a public relations video for the hospital where they were filming rather than a really, good story."
tt3398228,"Seriously though. Best show currently on television. 
At first, I thought it was another cartoon for adults only with poor drawings. But it's not. It's different.
For one, the jokes are funnier and the sads are sadder. The first season starts out more of a plain funny show, but beware this show will break your heart if you stick with it. 
It is also a really clever show - I'm sure that I'm not smart enough to catch all the references but sometimes I get the jokes and that feels good. 
Also, this show may be one of the depictions of depression on TV and movies ever."
tt3398228,"One of the best and most emotional episodes ive ever seen in a tv show. This is a masterpiece, this is an experience."
tt3398228,"The story of a horse that changed my life.
Yes Bojack Horseman is simply something more than an animation series about animals and humans living together, not that it is much bigger than that.
At first, I strongly objected to the evaluation of the first episode of Bojack, which scored 7.1, man. What is that? I watched it four times and laughed the same amount each time.
Anyway, let's start the review.
The first season was hugely funny and intelligent, but nothing was measured by the rest of the seasons.
The series starts from the second season and reaches its climax in the third and continues to evolve until the last episode that will leave you feeling a great emptiness around you after you finish this great show
Bojack is one of my top 10 so I won't talk more than that.
One of the few offers that deserves a high rating.
My rating 9.8"
tt3398228,"Listen here, I am going to be the most straight up and ask myself these questions, and try to answer them: What is Bojack Horseman?What does it mean?What does it try to reflect?Why does it feel so real?I'll tell you in one word: because it is REAL. As real can get..It's every miserable dark corner of everyone's life that all of us is just too upset or tiny to talk about. It is the real real, showing every ugly and every petty, showing that we are just a piece of dust in this universe which is billions of years older than us, that we are meaningless and mostly little nothings, but we all want to be worth something...It is made as an animated 'cartoon' in which animals are like people, dumb jokes top even dumber jokes and it is goofy, but just to get the inner child out of you to keep you hooked, but if you are left believing that its just a goofy dumb show, then it is not for you and please leave it alone..it is life, human nature, a never ending art. And for you others, brothers, we are all Bojack Horseman's and you just need to let it go..try not to think about it. Live your life, be happy with stupid stuff, maybe find the love of your life.. just stay happy and loyal to the most importants. I love you:) And for the creators and masterminds behind the show, thank you so so much, you have my full attention, you answered a lot of questions that I could never find the answers for.. just thank you:)"
tt3398228,"I don't usually write reviews for shows, nor have I ever written about anything on IMDb before, but I felt as if I should after watching this show.It's hard to put into words the way I felt about watching BoJack Horseman. Sure, it starts out as a comedy with seemingly no real plot. Sometimes it just seems stupid, yet still comes off as possibly a new, interesting yet also run-of-the-mill animated series, but it starts to develop into something more. Something that I think a lot of people may or may not fully see to the end of the first season because they decided the show wasn't for them. And that might still be true. But I can't help but feel some form of disappointment. Why? I don't really know. I guess I just foolishly want everyone to get something out of it.I don't think anything, whether it's a book, a movie, a game, or even a show deserves a 10. But sometimes, for just a brief instant, you stop caring about how you want to quantify how much you like something and just want to express how much you enjoyed it. That to me is the only way I can really describe BoJack Horseman. I can't say it's good, or bad, or even average. It's just a show that wants to get its point across, whether it's original or not. And it does it in a way that's hard to look at critically.And at the risk of sounding like I'm contradicting everything I've already tried to say, I almost don't want the show to have a new season. Not because I hate it or think it's ""too good"" to continue on, but because it already feels complete. I obviously don't feel bad that the series has already been renewed for a second season. And even if it happened to only be a two season series, I'd still be thrilled. It's just that in some way, I hope it doesn't change.So even though most likely no one will be reading this review (which is actually more like a reflection of how I felt about the show rather than a genuine examination), I at least hope that more people will try watching it and get some enjoyment out of it. Even if it's only for one episode. Who knows? I might even look back at it and wonder what I was thinking, or why I wrote a frankly pointless review about it.But that's alright. Because in the moment, it was something memorable."
tt3398228,"BoJack Horseman is what modern Family Guy wishes it could be and then some; it's a black-comedy-drama show that looks into the life of a washed up television actor who's struggling to find happiness in his life and ultimately remains unsuccessful in achieving that. Who'd have thought a cartoon about an anthropomorphic horse would end up being one of the deepest things currently on television? I'm genuinely surprised by what this show had to offer for me the first time I watched it. The first season's initial half is a little slow, but from then on BoJack transcends into a wacky comedy-drama that is one of the bravest shows to confront the issues of depression, anxiety, loneliness and nostalgia.I love this show. I can hardly fault it for anything besides the initially-slow premiere episodes, which I still reckon are great entertainment in and of themselves. This is a show that rewards your patience and loyalty to it ten-fold.Netflix's animation achievement gets 5/5 stars."
tt3398228,"Who would have thought that a show about an anthropomorphic horse set in Hollywood would be one of the most human shows ever made. That was what Raphael Bob-Waksberg managed with BoJack Horseman. It's a show that's hilarious and dramatic, satirical and tragic as we follow BoJack Horseman and his friends through the trials of life. The show could be nilhilistic and the characters could be prophetic about their own destinies *couch* Sarah-Lynn *couch.* BoJack Horseman offers up on the best portraits on issues like mental health and addiction and doesn't sugarcoat anything. This makes the show so relatable and lets it stand out."
tt3398228,"Netflix, in their continuing mission to provide premium content to their subscribers, has another hit on their hands with BoJack Horseman. I had some reservations before watching the first episode, because there hasn't been a great new animated series in several years now. But with such a great cast on board, I figured it was worth a try. So glad I did, because it ended up being the best original comedy I have seen in a while, animated or otherwise. It does not take long at all to get wrapped up in the story of BoJack, a has-been actor known for his role as a single dad in a popular early '90s sitcom. Having not acted in the 18 years since the show was canceled, he agrees to pen a memoir in an effort to relaunch his career. When confronted with the reality of how he is perceived by others, BoJack becomes desperate for acceptance and redemption from both the public and his inner circle. For the most part, people from normal walks of life are portrayed as humans, while the elite class like actors and their agents are portrayed as animals. It's a surprisingly effective method to humanize these characters to whom the common person does not easily relate. Will Arnett, Kristen Schaaf, Aaron Paul, and Amy Sedaris all give their characters a 3-dimensional quality that is difficult to achieve in a 2D platform like animation. It helps that it is wonderfully drawn, with many subtleties that reinforce each character's persona.Instead of a loosely assembled pile of anecdotal stories with characters that are just given a reason to exist, all the events during each episode contribute to the progress of the plot over the course of the first season. With episodes picking up exactly where the last one left off, the show feels more like a 3-act mini series than a TV show. That said, there are plenty of crass jokes and innuendo that will satisfy viewers who are not vested in the overall story. I am delighted that the series has been picked up for a second season and to see in what direction the story of BoJack and his inner circle takes us."
tt3398228,"One of the best things to ever come from Netflix, BoJack Horseman is excellent. The characters feel extremely real. They are flawed, but learn and grow as the show progresses. More people need to watch this showz"
tt3398228,"The thing with BoJack Horseman is that it takes a couple of episodes to find its stride and those first couple of episodes have caused many a person to stop watching. It's a shame, because it ends up being really great, with moments that are poignant and sad and really sort of grab you in a way you don't expect. Every actor is terrific, the animation is good, it's just an all around great show. It's not quite quite Archer, but then what is, you know? I loved this and ended up watching the entire series in one sitting which is a shame because I have nothing to look forward to until / if they go for a second season."
tt3398228,"I gave it half of Season 1 and I'm done. There is nothing in these episodes. There are many better ways to spend my time than waiting for this series to become watchable. I thought I could put it in the background but plain music is better choiceMost TV shows get only one chance at captivating the audience, I'm not about to sit through whole seasons just to reach some decent development. In order to even care about the relationships and the ways this story would go I have to first care about the characters and I just don't. All they do is whine about consequences of their own actions, while living relatively comfortable lives. Every major character is selfish and self-absorbed and in so does bad things to those around them, boo hoo. Imagine a bunch of rich bored people who only see their first world problems and will walk over anyone and everyone, there's zero loyalty and all the self pity. But as talking walking animals. Which is an attribute they don't utilize, I don't even know why they're animals. Real life is full of pretentious jerks as it is, we really don't need them in fantasy media. And even if they end up as moral goodie goodies I just don't care, they've annoyed me too much at the very beginning to invest myself into their journey.Humor is boring and predictable, funny 1 in 34 attempts, even by 2014 standards
Art style is tragic
There's just no reason to keep watching. No beloved characters, it's not pretty, it's not new it's not even funny."
tt3398228,"Like the incessant influx of superhero films currently pervading Hollywood, ""adult"" animation has become a genre that borders upon an overstayed welcome. As a result, my personal expectations for the Netflix original series ""BoJack Horseman"" were not particularly high, but I do like to keep an open mind. Much to my delight, the series provides humor, drama, well-written and connected story lines as well as solid character development. BoJack is simultaneously a disdainful but overall likable character performed wonderfully by Will Arnett. He is joined by a fabulous cast of characters / voice actors that instantly bring this show to the level of other modern animated successes such as Bob's Burgers. In fact, I could absolutely have pictured H. Jon Benjamin as BoJack, but he already seems to lend his voice talents to so many different areas. The series also provides a fairly original artistic presentation as the characters almost resemble a painted portrayal at times. The show is not only humorous, but also covers subjects such as unrequited love, self-loathing, substance abuse, betrayal, and other more serious concerns that really serve to draw the viewer into the series. Overall, ""BoJack Horseman"" is an incredibly impressive entry into the burgeoning repertoire of successful Netflix original programming and I hope to see this series continue for years to come."
tt3398228,"Okay, I know there are not much Bojack fans around here. I even tried recommending this show to a lot of my close friends. But they couldn't make it past few episodes. Well the answer to that is, even the actors mentioned during various interviews, that you gotta binge watch this show. I binged it like crazy and I was left with nothing but emotional hollowness all around me. Every ending of an episode led me to contemplate about life. And then there were episodes which made me go all teary eyed. All the people who loved this show is because deep down all of us are Bojack Horseman.. Someone please give this show a Golden GLobe!!"
tt3398228,"In a world populated by both people and anthropomorphic animals, Bojack Horseman (voiced by Arrested Development and SNL's Will Arnett) follows the life of the titular horse, a former sitcom star. Bojack isn't the best person and has a lot of emotional and mental issues. I loved this show and consider it one of the best adult animated programs of all time.This dark comedy is an excellent analysis of human nature, mental health, and the question of redemption. Be prepared that Bojack really does some awful things, though the show wisely paces them out. Yet, the show also manages to make you feel for Bojack. To clarify, the show never validates his actions. In fact, there is self-criticism of the its own anti-hero genre. The writing, characterization, and use of continuity in this show is EXCELLENT.Though the last paragraph makes this sound super dramatic, there's plenty of comedy and it's really, really funny. There is some really cutting satire of Hollywood and showbusiness. The show does a good job of balancing the darker aspects with lighter stuff. Bojack's goofy, carefree longtime house guest Todd (Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul) is a great balance with his wacky misadventures.Also, this is that rare show that never drops a beat. All six seasons are quality, including the last one whose cancellation was sudden.I can't recommend this enough. This show is pure genius."
tt3398228,"Now that the show is over, I need to shout a big thank you to the it and all the people that made it happen.
Just, just that.
Thank you."
tt3398228,"While the first season wasn't fully developed in it's characters and situations, I still enjoyed it very much, and had developed a bit of an emotional attachment during the last 3-4 episodes. But nothing could have ever prepared me for seasons 2 and 3, which offered some of the most poignant insights into celebrity culture and the nature of depression for a multitude of characters, which had by the time become grounded in their own right, I have EVER witnessed. I can't even put my thoughts into words for this review because I love this show so much, which is very surprising, I try to stay as formal as possible. I won't spoil anything, but there was a few different episodes in the past 2 seasons that made me cry, scream, hate, love, everything. This is really one of the few animated shows I can think of that brings on pure, unaltered moments of absolute emotion from the deep dark places of my soul. I connected in ways I never would have thought possible to Bojack, as well as a few other characters in the show. This is a must watch for anybody and everybody, you just have to get past the first half of the first season to truly start to love it.Oh, and the show is also outstandingly funny. Worthwhile as a comedy alone."
tt3398228,"When I began this series, I had absolutely no clue how incredible it would prove to be. I was a fan of adult cartoons before seeing BoJack, I initially expected it to be one of those shows with some funny moments and occasional good messages, however upon viewing, my mind was completely blown. It was first recommended to me by a friend and I saw a few episodes, I thought it was okay but not amazing, but later on the new season (at the time) came out and he recommended it to me again, I picked up where I left off and after a couple more episodes, I was entirely hooked. Never before had I seen such hard-hitting, heartbreaking, emotional topics handled so elegantly, whilst still consistently achieving hilarious humor. In my opinion, BoJack is the second best TV show ever to exist (the first being Breaking Bad) and I 100% stand by BoJack as being the best show on Netflix, way better than the pathetic excuses for shows like 'Paradise PD' and 'Big Mouth'. I recommend this show to the moon and back, but get the tissues at the ready."
tt3398228,"I don't know why I took so long to watch this one, it had been recommended to me to plenty of times for the last few years. This became my favorite adult animated show. Rick and Morty is good with the subjects of nihilism and it has it's depiction of self destructive depression but it doesn't get it quite as right as BoJack Horseman. Every form of depression is presented in this show and they're presented in such an accurate way, I had tears in my eyes watching a talking horse go through similar situations I have been in. In some ways I relate to BoJack but I saw myself more in the characters of Diane and Princess Caroline. That's the beauty of this show, every character is relatable in some way but the way they've been written is so natural, it's not a forced depiction of the various damaged type of folks that exist in society.The character development in this show is phenomenal. We see BoJack's ongoing struggle with depression, trying really hard to be a better person but falling back into his toxic patterns. Every season he digs himself into a deeper hole because he refuses to fix himself, because he believes he can't be fixed - this is present in the character of Diane as well but her forms of self sabotage are more subtle. Different forms of depression are shown from substance abuse to self delusion and they're all presented in the most accurate way. I love the episodes where we get into the heads of BoJack, Diane, and Princess Caroline. We see how BoJack has an ongoing battle in his head going from positives to absolute negatives, he tries to have self love but it immediately transitions to self hatred. Diane can't forget the hurt she faced in her early years, constantly hearing her father and school bullies talking her down. Princess Caroline helps herself feel better by imagining her grandchild talk about her successes in the future. The way these moments are shown, even the style of animation they choose to present these moments, it's just a brilliant work of art altogether.The show definitely has its many moments of humor, this is a comedy after all. Todd and Mr. Peanutbutter provide the comic relief although they have their deep moments as well, but the show does an incredible job of showing you that although these characters may appear stupid, they're actually the happiest people in the entire series. Both of them have their tough moments but they both rise out of their problems better than the other characters because they're happy. I love that they have BoJack admit to Mr. Peanutbutter that the main reason he does not like to be around him is because he envies him for his happiness, that was such a powerful moment. I hadn't seen a moment that powerful in a film or series in so long and I didn't expect to see it in a show about a talking depressed has-been horse.Honestly I can go on and on about how amazed I am with this show. I can even write an entire essay about how this show properly depicts mental illness. As someone who still battles with depression here and there, I felt completely understood with this show. Finally someone got it right and it was a show in a universe where talking animals cohabitate with humans. I will rewatch this many more times. It's a show that knew when it was time to end and connected every single story they told until the very end. The writing in this show, to all the writers out there that want to tell great stories on screen or even in a book, watch this show and take notes.I love BoJack Horseman, thank you the team that brought this show to life. I'm not exaggerating when I say I'm an eternally grateful to know this show exists and understood my pain in a way I never thought any form of media could completely understand - in a way I had not felt since Amy Winehouse released Back to Black. Highly recommend this show, you will not regret it. It's a masterpiece."
tt3398228,"I started watching Bo Jack when I was 17 years old.
I am now 23. This show grew in depth and maturity as I did. The way that it captures the darkness and ugliness of life, while also celebrating in its wild crazy unpredictability, is like nothing else.
While I struggled with purpose, meaning, mental health, drugs and the rich expanse of life that is sometimes so difficult, I felt I could relate to Bo Jack Horseman. It is a very honest portrayal of many things. And a very, very, gloriously silly way to do it.
I grew with these characters. There is something profound about this. This piece of art, that I know will never be done again. The attention and care and genius that is here, is worth celebrating.
Thank you for Bo Jack Horseman"
tt3398228,"Wow. Bojack Horseman is an amazing show with fascinating episodes that are creative and unique for TV today. It deals with deep and complex characters and faces so many issues with a refreshing style. Some episodes are incredibly emotional and extremely immersive. However, I felt the earlier seasons were not as good as the later seasons - my personal favourite being season 4 as the main storyline dealt with a complicated, depressing issue in a breathtaking way. Bojack Horseman is not the funniest show, there are plenty of chuckles though. Overall this show was amazing with great writing and was something so different to everything else I have seen."
tt3398228,"...Ok, so apparently I'm the only person in the world whose not crazy off his rocker bonkers about this show, and I think a disgruntled mob with pitchforks might assemble on my front lawn to skewer me for saying so... but heres my take....First the pros: It has decent writing, and occasional* (emphasis on occasional) funny and insightful social and cultural bits of satire /commentary and top notch voice acting particularly from Will Arnett and Aaron Paul and it does have one of the best intros sequences I think of any animated show but ... The cons: it's still just essentially a half decent yet self indulgent empty depressive sitcom about a washed up entitled kind of dumb egocentric but self aware sitcom Actor and his struggle between validating a legacy and using it to compensate for his self doubt stemming from a broken childhood and filling the voids inbetween with more voids and everybody thinks it's so novel because it's pointlessly packaged as a cartoon, barely using the medium of animation to be visually creative other than pointlessly making random characters animals as generic one note personality jokes or puns that get boring after 2 minutes, they pidgeonhole (no pun intended) themselves into this then beat it to death for the rest of the show...there's an episode with a chicken where they pull literally every chicken pun possible out until by the end I felt like someone vindictively shoved a rubber chicken down my throat.....and I was coughing up feathers....and why the heck is bojack horseman a HORSE!!!! and they really blew an opportunity to create a clever buddy dynamic between Todd and Bojack, and they flirted with this idea in the beginning of the show but instead they turned Todd into a pointless dimwitted borderline mentally handicapped jester in a series of loosely related incoherent idiotic b story misadventures, hes totally undeveloped as a character, just a 2 dimensional cardboard cutout of a character with no depth or motivations explored, compared to Bojack, a fairly well fleshed out character...its a blown opportunity.....strip away the animation and it's just a inconsistent average hollywood sitcom spoof about behind the scenes hollywood and the fallout of a once iconic sitcom.... with all the worst elements of Hollywood elites* ...the whining about their problems ugh turned into a cynical satirical pity party of pretention...although they do lampoon themselves and celebrity culture to be fair, however it's just the fact that it takes place in that element to begin with that's ironically annoying to me..., I despise the vapid superficiality of celebrity obsession culture and it feels like the celebrity tabloids turned into a cartoon...I can see this being great material to those in the industry that can relate but for me, and Gob bless you if you like it, its a total chore to get through most episodes and is at the bottom of the barrel compared to all the other good animated shows imo, dont waste your time or be duped by the incoceivable hype...., the fact that everybody and their grandma rave about this show is beyond me, I am genuinely baffled, the return on investment in terms of quality does not warrant the watch imho... dont get me wrong, it has its moments and their are a handful of clever well paced episodes where it all comes together (particularly the last 3 episodes of season one) but that's only about 15% of the time...because after this it just sunk back into a lull again...not high enough numbers in a field of top notch competition, sorry, pass"
tt7137906,The acting in this series especially by the kids/young adults really pulled me in. I havent gotten this emotional watching anything in a long time. The last episode had me in tears multiple and I hope viewers withhold judgment till they see the whole thing. This is still so relevant 30 years later.
tt7137906,Hard to watch and because it feels so real it really makes me sad and angry.
tt7137906,Brilliant but very hard to watch. It made me so angry. Fantastic acting from start to finish.
tt7137906,"This production, which has been very popular since the introduction process, made an ambitious introduction to Netflix. When They See Us aims to tell an impressive story that has shaken the audience deeply.The series focuses on the ""Central Park Five"" incident in 1989. Since many people are aware of this tragic event thanks to this series, the mission that the series takes on is very important. Five blackish youths are unfairly accused of rape in Central Park in 1989. The series, which tells the struggle of these five young people against justice, dates from 1989 to 2002. The series, which reveals a flutter that touches the heart, is not only important because it is based on reality, but also has inferences that shed light on today. When They See Us is very successful in reflecting the tension and drama of young people's struggle for justification. The main reason why emotions are well reflected is the excellent acting performances in the series. Accurate actor preferences help to better reflect the screenplay with an impressive fiction. Episodes ranging from 60 to 80 minutes allow the 23-year process to be followed step by step. A successful cinematography has been applied to ensure that this tense atmosphere is supported visually. Apart from the main characters, there are also successful names in episodes of the series. The series, which has a crowded staff, is becoming one of the productions to be watched thanks to this collective success.When They See Us reflects a successful example of a genre not so common in Netflix. To see the reflections of a true-life event with its different dimensions in today's world will give the viewers a new perspective. An excellent option for those who want a quality drama. 10/10"
tt7137906,"Compelling. Just goes to show how messed up a county America is.
My heart go out to the Wrongly accused."
tt7137906,"Rating: 8.5/10Themes: Biography, History, Drama, Racism, Injustice, Rape, Prison, Persecution, Law, Police & Crime.Review: This story is something that honestly leaves me speechless. There are no words to describe the outrage I feel with regards to this situation or the injustice of what these five boys went through. It's insane. It's crazy. It's UNJUST. However, I'm now going to go into the actual execution of this series, rather than the story itself, which, in my opinion, left certain things to be desired. I think the first and final episode were chilling and were able to portray the story in the exact right manner. However, the middle two episodes (especially the third) could have been done better. They didn't hit as deep and they felt very rushed. I feel like we didn't really get to see the struggle Kevin, Yusef, Antron and Raymond went through after they got convicted. I feel like we glossed over their experiences a little bit. Opposingly, Korey's life was depicted in detail and with a lot of emotion (in the final episode), and it was his story that eventually brought me to tears. In conclusion, this story is a devastating one, and this series luckily brings a strong light to that, but I personally feel like some things could have been executed a little better to portray the story even better and do even more justice to all these five boys."
tt7137906,"This is one of the most beautiful and emotional mini series of the year so far. Well directed, excellent character building, amazing acting and well scripted. It touches your soul and cries out your heart. Thank you, Netflix!"
tt7137906,"The only bad reviews I have seen are by conservative commentators who see it as a political diatribe. It isn't. It's the brutally honest story of a horrible tragedy and the racial discrimination of the time, exemplified in a nationally known case. Unfortunately for conservatives, if it's a story about racial discrimination - which has existed throughout history and continues to exist today - its considered a liberal agenda, even though it is not. It's a story of Injustice, and an excellent one at that.
Side note: Now some commentators have some now claimed that it blames Trump, but it doesn't. I would point out, however, that Trump backed their conviction and opposed their being let go even after it was demonstrated they were innocent."
tt7137906,"This was an uncomfortable but necessary watch. I was very familiar with the case, even more so that I actually thought but to see it acted out and shot so tremendously was gut wrenching. Sadly injustice has been and will be part of life until the end of time, undoubtedly there's people fighting through it right now. I've seen quite a few negative reviews that this is just a puppet show to stomp on Trump and if that's your belief fine, but in my view facts speak for themselves and I knew about Trumps involvement in this case before this series, but there's no doubt the writer/director really wanted that message out there. Putting all politics, corruption and media aside, it's a truly harrowing, gut wrenching story about how five normal BOYS, lost their freedom, youth and innocence and how all of them including the victim never saw justice served correctly. A hard watch but a must watch."
tt7137906,Honestly one of the most beautiful and moving portrayals I've ever seen. The acting is spot on. Keeps your emotions going from start to end. Such a powerful series with a strong message. This is a must watch
tt7137906,"The reason this is good is because of the real story, not because of anything Ava brought to the table. Everything is so drawn out, as only she can do, and tedious and boring. Most people won't criticize because of the real story but I am able to disconnect the real story to a poor job in creating this film version.
There are a lot of empty spots in this film. Antron's daddy's story is horribly incomplete. Part 3 was a total waste. We don't see a dramatic prison experience until part 4 with Corey; the other ones are kind of put to the side. There is an unnecessary ""love"" scene"" with little man's sister that had nothing to do with nothing. Part 1 and 2 are drawn out. The only reason it's a 6 rating is because part 4 is good. Then there's that horrible interview by Oprah, talking about when they see us now. She was asking elementary questions."
tt7137906,"This is educational, jaw dropping, sickening, eye opening, impeccably done on every level, and makes u really think how this could have happened. The DA and the lead Detective should be in jail because this is criminal. The story is true and those accountable for lying to take away 5 young kids lives need to be exposed.I hope every kid sees this in this country. It's not only about race but about being smart and unifying as a country . Understanding the ""justice system"". Don't forget the Kleenex when u watch ep 4."
tt7137906,"Firstly I would like to state, taking the tiny portion given to Trump and then shoving aside the rest of the series is YOUR right. Coming on here and trying to act like your review gives meaning, is also okay.Now an actual review after watching it all. If you can set aside politics and see the much bigger message of The Central Park Five, you'll be able to bear witness a masterpiece. DuVernay has made their story hit hard to a generation who all may not have been around or heard of the tragedy. To those who were around then will see how past mistakes are still made today. Injustice in the justice system continuing with no regards to consequence. To all this can strike a chord if you just watch for their story at the least. This will be a series talked about so might as well watch it and take whatever you get out of it. If there is any takeaway my review can hold it should be this, pause when you need to take a moment. This series is raw but a needed series."
tt7137906,I just finished the first episode and have never felt so outraged. I wanted to turn it off. I just cannot believe those cops were so corrupt. I will continue to watch so that hopefully justice will prevail. This series is intense and I think it's going be worth watching!
tt7137906,"I bet there are some scenes you don't want to watch it, you can't watch it, it's very very difficult to digest. Acting is brilliant, you will get to see pure raw emotions.
Though some of the trump supporters are ruining the show's rating, It's a 10/10, and deserve to heard and watch at least once."
tt7137906,I made a mistake in my first review of this Netflix mini series! I wanted to correct myself when I said do read all of the negative reviews. What I want to say is please do not read all of the negative reviews on here. Watch it and make up your own mind!
tt7137906,"The acting by all the leading young men in this series was amazing.
It was very thought provoking and hard to watch at times at the brutality they had to suffer.
Certainly opens your eyes to how people have had to suffer through injustice, and how we are at the mercy of the that system.
So thought provoking, bravo to all the people that put together this great piece of work.
Definitely a must see:)"
tt7137906,"The Trump supporting trolls on here are trying to ruin the overall rating for this compelling story that needs to be told over and over again! This film is definitely not a 1 out of 10 like they're rating it. It deserves at least an 8 just for the acting alone to which I felt was excellent. If you haven't already, please watch the highly acclaimed award winning documentary The Central Park Five. It goes into greater detail about the corrupt NYPD Detectives who brutalized these men who were just innocent kids at the time. I was so pleased that they eventually were exonerated and succeeded in suing New York City and receiving an award for $41 million! This is still happening to Black men in America today, there are many Black men being released after having spent 25-30 years in prison for a crime they didn't commit to receive little to nothing in monetary compensation. Overall, I think this was an excellent Mini-series."
tt7137906,"The final episode of this series was a hard-to-watch heart-wrenching experience, but the hardship Korey experienced is the same for thousands of inmates, and I don't think it makes much difference whether they are innocent or not... However well it played as a psychological drama, in a series about the case of the Central Park Five, I expect a thorough examination of the societal structures that causes the criminal justice system to fail. If the series is meant to be informative and facilitate discussion and change, one-dimensional antagonists won't do. Prison guards that seem to do evil for evils sake is one cinematic sin, but the real shame is that the power dynamics between the prosecutor, the police, businesses and politicians is not explored. We understand that they are caught in a web of lies at the end, but we don't get the bigger picture, which is necessary if we're to understand what motivated them and got them to this point. In real life, there is a hierarchy, and everyone would have someone cracking a whip over them, forcing them to go forward aggressively with their part in the case. Professionals usually don't make bad decisions because they're ""evil"", but because they are under pressure - from their leaders, from colleges or other circumstances. A few bad apples is not what causes justice to fail so spectacularly over and over. It's the system itself that is rotten to the core. However, instead of taking a hard look at society and classicism, the series settles for racism and outrage. Thus, it fails to become more than peculiar entertainment, which I don't think was the intent!"
tt7137906,"Who needs trolls to spread disinformation and stir up divisions, when we have Ava DuVernay?This is the kind of divisive, manipulative and most importantly, grossly inaccurate rewriting of history, which took the most extreme defense claims and presented them as truth. Truth be damned.Oprah was blaming Ms. Meili for running alone when she first interviewed her back in 2002. Fringe-driven manipulation like this is what brought us Trump. Because Trump is a reaction to this, and this is a mirror image of what Trump does.What is being buried by this false narrative is the fact that the ""five"" were convicted of viciously assaulting 8 victims on the same day, beating at least one unconscious. There is no dispute about this. Based on medical evidence and witness testimony, they are almost certainly guilty of beating Ms. Meili, who was later raped and further injured by Matias Reyes.The execution is reasonably well done, if at the level of a prime time network show. But because of political and identity social pressure, the critics must love it (or be dragged through the mud).But make no mistake, this is propaganda, at its worst. Sometimes even Trump is right: this is ""fake news."""
tt0133093,"When this came out, I was living with a roommate. He went out and saw it, came home and said, ""Dude, you have to go see The Matrix."" So we left and he sat through it a second time. This movie is splendidly done. The mystery about what the Matrix is, unravels and you see a dystopian future unlike any we as a race would want. I have watched this over and over and never tire of it. Everyone does a great job acting in this, the special effects are above par and the story is engaging."
tt0133093,"The Matrix - 1999This was a real change in filmmaking. Like watching it again in 2020, i.e. after 21 years and it still feels fresh. Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.A salute to Wachowski Brothers and the team for creating this masterpiece. It will be a great competition and motivation as well for many films coming in the future."
tt0133093,"This film doesn't age, it will be contemporary even in 2030 or 2040.
Wachowski's best one, by far."
tt0133093,"The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre.  There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.)  There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects.  With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync.  Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition.  Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes.  The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky.  The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of.  The photography was breathtaking.  (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.)  And the acting?  Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did.  But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting.  As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked!  Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne.  His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation.  My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE.  What is the Matrix, you ask?  Something that's closer to reality than you think.Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time."
tt0133093,"The film is as well crafted as the matrix itself! On another level entirely to any other science fiction film from the last 20 years . Getting lost in another world, is interly what Cinema is made for. This one takes you into a whole new universe interly ."
tt0133093,"Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.10/10 - on my top 3 of best films."
tt0133093,"At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away."
tt0133093,What if I told you the Matrix is not a Sci-Fi but a Documentary movie?
tt0133093,"Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made."
tt0133093,"Ok, I'm getting sick of comments saying stuff like ""The Matrix is the greatest film EVER MADE!""That's complete and utter bullturd. Yes, it had great cinematography and effects, yes it had a great soundtrack but NO WAY was the acting superb and NO WAY was the storyline great.Take that storyline and stick it in any other action movie and you would leave feeling disappointed at the end. It's major selling point was ""What is the Matrix? You have to see it for yourself."" Come on, the only plot twist was that thing to do with Cypher, and that wasn't greatly unforeseeable, there's things like that in every frigging action movie.The thing that set it apart was the ground-breaking camera effects, gnarly special effects and a funky soundtrack, as well as the costume design bit, with all that leather and expensive sunglasses. Without this stuff, all you would be left with is your average action movie.I'm not saying it was a bad film at all, just not one of the greatest. Highly entertaining, great to watch with your mates, definitely one of the most interesting films in recent years. But give me The Third Man, Memento or the Usual Suspects any day.7/10"
tt0133093,"and this is all. because each explanation sounds wrong. sure, the acting,, the plot, the fight/action scenes are great. maybe unique. but the essence, for me, remains the basic idea . a fake reality against the pure truth. and the magic as clothes of each character. because it is more than a film. it is a revolution in the way to see a film and to discover reality. you are Neo. and the mythological mix of symbols and cultural references and the simple story who seems have more and more levels are more than fascinating - it is real. sure, Matrix has a lot of reviews and around it is very easy to say hypothesis, verdicts, opinions or, maybe, critics. it is enough to say it is a masterpiece. or the perfect fascinating fairy tale."
tt0133093,"So much greatness about this well done crafty philosophical masterpiece! One of the greatest films ever made; a true benchmark in cinema and huge meticulously brilliant cabinet file of important metaphors. I smile so much while watching The Matrix, I'm so happy it had a 20th anniversary. I'm beyond intrigued by these types of society thought-provoking gems; there aren't enough of them!!"
tt0133093,"You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work."
tt0133093,"This movie is so well written that you can't even prove this movie is wrong about our world. This movie mades you think that our world can be just a reflection, a fake world. It's not just about the war between AI and humanity. It's more about questioning the reality.And years later the idea is never gets old. This is the movie that you should respect if someone says ""I think this is the greatest movie of all time."" because it has somethings unique, not special it's just unique.It's beyond all the Science-Fiction movies. Normally Sci-Fi movies mades you think ""Can this subject of the movie be real someday?"" and actually only some of them made you think that way. This one mades you think ""I can't deny, this could be our reality. We can never be sure.""Besides making one of the greatest Fictional Universes, this movie also achieves so much more.And not only that, this movie is also achieves something great in Action. It has the most iconic action scenes. Action director is so great. Revolutionary VFX and SFX, amazing Set Decoration and more."
tt0133093,"Truly a masterpiece in every way! If it wasn't for Fight Club this would my favorite; I've been on the fence about it. The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!For example the entire speech Morpheus says ""The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind."" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.The effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!A lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is. I respect that; I've always wanted to work on film just haven't had a way for many reasons. If you've read this far or even at all thanks and sorry! I usually don't leave a review this long, just thought it was worth it for this one. Check out my others if you're interested for now 10 out of 10 phenomenal movie in many ways!"
tt0133093,"20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels...."
tt0133093,"The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.I'm yet to meet somebody who hasn't enjoyed it. It's my favourite movie to watch on a good cinema system, too."
tt0133093,"Really, my summary says it all.It's a cute premise overwhelmed by its need to be cool at the expense of plot, characters, meaning, or consistency. It has philosophical and literary pretensions that come off as kindergarten philosophy at best and ham-handed at worst. Luckily, these can be ignored fairly easily.Good action sequences for the most part. Most of the cast is summer-movie capable. i.e. Their acting is neither embarrassing nor impressive. Keanu gives his second-best performance ever (after Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure). Unfortunately, that is likely merely the convergence of his naturally confused look with the confusion inherent to the character.All things considered a fun action movie provided you don't buy the hype telling you that it is so much more.By the way, stop with this one. This movie is watchable and complete in its own and is only degraded by its truly dreadful sequels. If this movie is the triumph of style over substance, its sequels are the cruel beating and maiming of substance by style gone bad."
tt0133093,"The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller.  Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.Boy, was I wrong.  Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome.  And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).But the movie has plot as well.  It has characters that I cared about.  From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles.  I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion.  It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes!  Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before.  Watch one of the fight scenes.  Then watch the whole movie.  There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters.  Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE.  If you haven't, you're missing out on one of the best films of all time.  It isn't just special effects, folks."
tt0092455,"I love this series so much. I like the characters, how they interact with each other and just the plot alone. This is pure genius. Going on adventures with the crew and having a bit of humor along the way. The acting is supreme and the soundtrack is nice too. I ❤ this series very much and can only recommend it !"
tt0092455,"Nearly twenty years after the original Star Trek was cancelled by NBC, Gene Roddenberry and Paramount sought to capitalize on the enormous success of TOS in syndication and on the big screen. Roddenberry decided to make the new series with few connections to the original, so that it could stand on its own. Many fans didn't like the idea of new characters, but Roddenberry pressed ahead, and Star Trek: The Next Generation was born. British stage actor Patrick Stewart assumed the role of Frenchman Captain Jean-Luc Picard, bringing gravitas, phenomenal acting skills, and an English accent that would become the boon of many jokes; Jonathon Frakes became William T. Riker, the Kirk-esque ""Number One"" with a love for the ladies and jazz; Brent Spiner was cast as Data, the android who envied human emotion; Gates McFadden was Dr. Beverly Crusher, the CMO with a complicated past with Captain Picard; Wil Wheaton was her irritating son Wesley, who would long annoy the fans; Michael Dorn brought a distinct presence to the recurring role of Klingon officer Worf, so much that he was promoted to regular. Marina Sirtis looked good as Deanna Troi, the psychiatrist who had once been involved with Riker; LeVar Burton was cast as Geordi LaForge, the blind Conn Officer; finally, Denise Crosby was Security Chief Tasha Yar. Also in the pilot was an unnamed conn officer played by Colm Meaney, who would later become Transporter Chief Miles O'Brien.The first two seasons were of average quality, but they did a good job of setting up the characters and expanding the Trek universe. The series gathered its own following, although it continued to exist in the shadow of TOS. Q became an ongoing presence, appearing twice more after the pilot. His third appearance had him introducing the crew to the Borg, the fearsome cyborgs who would become Trek's most famous villains. Denise Crosby left TNG near the end of the first year, saying that her character wasn't being given enough to do. The producers also removed Gates McFadden's Dr. Crusher, introducing Dr. Kate Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) to induce more conflict. The fans did not take to Pulaski, so McFadden was brought back for the start of Season Three. That season was when TNG really came into its own, ending with the reappearance of the Borg. The Borg abducted Captain Picard, and turned him into one of them; Riker, now in command, gave the order to destroy the Borg Cube, while Picard was still onboard. That was the greatest cliffhanger in TV history, and TNG received a great deal of media attention as a result. Droves of new viewers tuned in for the fourth season premiere, which many perceived as a bit of a letdown after all the hype; but the viewers stayed, and TNG soared in the ratings, producing more and more quality episodes. While it did lose a bit of steam in its final year, it finished with an incredible series finale, All Good Things..., and then launched a movie franchise of its own.TNG Top Ten Episodes: Conundrum; The Next Phase; Data's Day; The Best of Both World Parts I & II; Redemption Parts I & II; Reunion; The Defector; Face of the Enemy; The Pegasus; Elementary, My Dear Data;"
tt0092455,"When the TNG series premiered in 1987, it wasn't greeted well by many of the old-time Trek fans, including myself. It didn't help matters that one of the earliest episodes, ""The Naked Now"" was a superficial retread of the classic ""The Naked Time"" from '66. The new episode should have served as a way of spotlighting several of the new crew, but all it did was show them all in heat. I wasn't too impressed. What did work was keeping the central theme of exploration (something lost in the offshoots, DS9 & Voyager). The new Enterprise was twice as large as the original, with about a thousand personnel aboard. Capt. Picard (Stewart) was a more cerebral, diplomatic version of the ultimate explorer we had known as Capt. Kirk. Again, Picard wasn't too impressive in the first two awkward seasons, as some may mistake his caution for weakness. The Kirk-like first officer Riker (Frakes) was controlled by Picard, so the entire crew of Enterprise-D came across as a bit too civilized, too complacent for their own good. It's interesting that this complacency was fractured by the most memorable episode of the first two years, ""Q Who?"" which introduced The Borg. All of a sudden, exploration was not a routine venture.Other memorable episodes of the first 2 years: the double-length pilot, introducing Q; ""Conspiracy""-an early invasion thriller; ""Where No One Has Gone Before""-an ultimate attempt to define the exploring theme; ""The Big Goodbye""-the first lengthy exploration of the new holodeck concept; ""Datalore""-intro of Data's evil twin; ""Skin of Evil""-death of Tasha Yar; ""11001001""-perhaps the best holodeck story; and ""The Measure of a Man""-placing an android on trial. Except for ""Q Who"" the 2nd year was even more of a letdown from the first. Space started to percolate in the 3rd season. I liked ""The Survivors""-introducing an entity resembling Q in a depressed mood, and ""Deja Q"" with both Q & Guinan squaring off, as well as other alien beings. A remaining drawback was the 'techno-babble' hindering many scripts, an aspect which made them less exciting than the stories of the original series. As Roddenberry himself believed, when characters spoke this way, it did not come across as naturalistic, except maybe when it was Data (Spiner), the android. The engineer La Forge (Burton), for example, was usually saddled with long, dull explanatory dialog for the audience.In the 3rd year, truly innovative concepts such as the far-out parallel-universe adventure ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" began to take hold, topped by the season-ender ""The Best of Both Worlds,part 1"" in which The Borg returned in their first try at assimilating Earth. After this and the 2nd part, the TNG show was off and running, at full warp speed. There are too many great episodes from the next 4 seasons to list here, but I tended to appreciate the wild, cosmic concept stories best: ""Parallels""(s7); ""Cause and Effect""(s5); ""Timescape""(s6); ""Tapestry""(s6); and the scary ""Frame of Mind"", ""Schisms"" and ""Genesis."" There's also the mind-blowing ""Inner Light""(s5), ""Conundrum"" and ""Ship in a Bottle""(s6), ""Second Chances."" The intense 2-parter ""Chain of Command"" was almost like a film, and the great return of Scotty in ""Relics"" was very entertaining, though it showed you can't go home again. The show also continued to tackle uneasy social issues, as in ""The Host"", ""The Outcast"", ""First Contact"" and ""The Drumhead"" as well as political:""Darmok"", ""Rightful Heir"", ""Face of the Enemy"" and ""The Pegasus."" The series ended on a strong note, ""All Good Things..."" a double-length spectacular with nearly the budget of a feature film. But it wasn't really the end. A few months later, an actual feature film was released ""Star Trek Generations""(94). It's rather ironic that the TNG films couldn't match the innovation and creativity of the last 4 seasons of the series. ""Star Trek Insurrection""(98) for example, is a lesser effort than any of the episodes mentioned above."
tt0092455,"This is an interesting, thought provoking, and most of all entertaining series. Gene Roddenberry not only gave us a ""Wagon Train to the Stars,"" but he gave us interesting stories reflecting the great values our society holds as truths. I know that ""some"" episodes were not that good, but that can be said of any series that has a long history. For the most part this program exceeds the mark of excellence in writing and entertainment. The delivery of the writing by Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner et. al. truly brought the Star Trek future to life. The casting of this program is wonderful!I would hope that anyone with the desire for interesting intelligent science fiction would find this program enjoyable. If a person today is ONLY seeking an action packed thrill ride, then perhaps they may not find the value in Star Trek. But I have loved the program from the first day I watched Captain Kirk in ""The Man Trap"" from 1966. Since then I have watched the development of Trek with an open mind. I believe that ST-TNG to be the best incarnation of all Trek programs, to date. In this day and age of terrorism, and threats of war, it would be nice if we could apply more of the philosophies from the possible future of this series. Maybe if more people watched this program the world would be a nicer place!?!"
tt0092455,I love TNG so much. All the characters are superb and Captain Picard is the best Captain ever. My favourite episode is always have been The Inner Light. 10/10.
tt0092455,"In an early episode, Captain Picard delivers a line from Hamlet: ""What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason, how infinite in faculty! In form and moving how express and admirable! In action how like an Angel! in apprehension how like a god!"" But he delivers it with conviction instead of irony, and by doing so creates the thesis of the entire franchise.Star Trek was never meant to be a realistic depiction of what the future will be like; rather, it's an optimistic argument for what the future could be like. Our heroes on the new Starship Enterprise are noble and rational, and the writing is more concerned with ethics than with punch-ups. Fans of Captain Kirk's red-blooded man of action might be disappointed, but then this is a more mature version of Star Trek. As we mature, we realize there are better ways to solve our problems than with violence. Patrick Stewart's Shakespearean captain is a renaissance man, capable of using the right words and unexpected actions to overcome obstacles, and he needs neither a hairpiece nor a fight scene to prove his character.The show's other standout star is the android Data, Spock's opposite yet kindred spirit. Where Spock repressed his emotions and was disdainful of illogical humans, Data is curious about our foibles and aspires to be more like us. That implies that being human is not a curse, but something wonderful and virtuous.There are no space wars in The Next Generation, and for a good reason: creator Gene Roddenberry hoped that by the 24th century war would be a thing of the past. The interpersonal conflicts and domestic dramas of other shows are here replaced by adventure and exploration. Human nature doesn't have to be absolute: people can change, and humanity can grow and evolve. Star Trek: The Next Generation is seven seasons of optimistic, outward-looking space adventure for people who believe that the human race doesn't need to be defined by the villains it faces, but by its own innate spirit."
tt0092455,"This series is a true marvel! I don't recall seeing any other series so diverse in its thematology, so rich in ideas. Patrick Stewart really adds a lot of depth to his role, throughout the series there are references to drama, literature, science that make some episodes a true journey through beautiful ideas. Also, the plot is sometimes very good, despite the scientific discrepancies one often encounters, or the effects that might at some points appear outdated. This is science fiction that aims to elucidate the eternal human questions, not just give a dramatized prospect of human evolution. Data is a unique character, his interaction with the captain (and the rest of the crew) is uniquely enjoyable, often giving insights into the evolution of human ethics, as for example in an episode where Captain Piccard is called to support the view that Data is a conscious life form and thus has the right to decide for his own fate; that he cannot be considered as property, even though he is a human construct. You really never know where the next episode will take you...from MacBeth to Cyrano, or from Data's love affair to the first contact with the crystaline entity, or Sherlock Holmes mysteries. Truly, I have never seen any other series with such a broad range of ideas and references. I wish to thank all those who made it possible, and Patrick Stewart for adding such a dramatic depth to his role. Truly, in no other case has an actor in TV done such a great job at combining so diverse elements in a single character, and with so superb acting...Patrick Stewart really carries you away with his acting, it is epic to say the least. I remember him in so many roles, never did he disappoint me.Its a magnificent work of art, one that stretches across many marvels of the human intellect to create its beautiful and educating (in the Greek sense, as actors become teachers of life through their dilemmas and adventures) drama."
tt0092455,"Grew up watching this show and the characters feel like family. Of course you have a weird or bad epp once in a while but for a whole it is just awesome. The science fiction is believable, the music is awesome, acting is spot on, really makes one's imagination wonder."
tt0092455,"Following the success of the Star Trek movies in the mid 1980s, the producers decided to put ST back on the small screen with a shiny new Enterprise a new crew and a whole host of new species worlds and enemies. The first season and the majority of the second season are a bit shaky but from the third season it picks up massively. Patrick Stewart is now the captain, a more cerebral, diplomatic captain and played wonderfully. This series introduced far more relationships between the crew (Troi and Riker, Worf and his son, Crusher and Picard) which play out beautifully over the course of the series. The Special effects considering their now nearly 15-20 years old still look good and the Enterprise D is a true flagship vessel.There's so many good episodes it's kind of hard to pick out anymore than the main standouts most people have mentioned already, Yesterday's Enterprise, The Best of Both Worlds, The Inner Light are probably the most popular but everything, certainly post seasons one and two provides good solid sci fi."
tt0092455,"Star Trek: The Next Generation is not just a TV show. It is a philosophy. TNG resembles the very best of Sciencie-Fiction tackling our everyday problems and beyond with a clear vision and moral compass. Gene Roddenberry was a true visionary and his ideas for a bright and positive future of mankind live on in this show. This vision is presented to you via great writing, brilliant acting, beautiful sets and effects (for its time) and an iconic soundtrack from grandmaster Jerry Goldsmith himself. They simply don't make shows like this anymore."
tt0092455,"What a great show. Really takes the original to another level, both visually and intellectually. Sticks to the original recipe of Stand alone episodes, full of adventure with a great cast. I can't believe this is now over 30 years old. Will not disappoint."
tt0092455,I'm a huge Trekkie. I think this series did a great job of creating the universe but didn't run with it as well as movies like First Contact did. Definitely ds9 trumps this in terms of entertainment value
tt0092455,"In my teens I was fanatical about the show. The possibilities, the dreams, the inspiration. We had Star Trek nights, Star Trek arguments, Start Trek groups. Yes, I was a big fan.So over twenty years later, I sat down to binge watch this show again. Twenty years ago I would have rated this an easy 10, now it is a generous 5.My biggest disappointments are 1. What is their mission? The opening credits clearly state ""...To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations..."". But in nearly every episode they are encountering a human colony, or within a few hours of a star base, or near the border of the neutral zone, or they are intercepting a shuttle craft. Apart from the three times they were flung to the far reaches of the Universe by The Traveller or Q, they never left Federation space. An Earth based analogy would be... ""They have left the city and are now driving around the suburbs, with the occasional foray into the rural countryside"". How are they exploring strange new worlds in their own backyard? Little imagination by the writers.2. The writers really did have a poor imagination of future life. All technology on the show looks clumsy, awkward and clunky. Really, did none of the writers or set designers consider slimline, sleek, holographic computer displays, flexible screens, screens with dynamic displays instead of the silly stenciled screens we see every episode, etc...3. The awards... Have you seen some of these awards? ""Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design"", ""Outstanding Individual Achievement in Editing "" and ""Outstanding Hairstyling for a Series"". Seriously?? This reminds me of awards being handed out to children in an event, even when they come last. Feel good awards.4. Characters were flat and poorly written but the standout performances of the regular cast were definitely Data and Captain Picard 5. Worf who was supposed to be some powerful security officer, but had his butt kicked in every single fighting scene, except two.6. Deanna Troi who had the annoying ability to state the obvious, but had no ability to use her powers when they were most needed. For a councilor she is over emotional and prone to fits of hysteria. Not the stability one would expect of a ships councilor. And to surpass her co-workers to become equal second highest rank on the ship was too much of a stretch to be taken seriously.7. Star Trek TOS of the 1960's seems to have set the technology standard for this show. Amazing that 30 years after TOS and the writers of TNG could not come up with anything unique, rather they were just extensions of the existing technology.Unfortunately, this has gone from memories of a great show with some bad episodes, to a very mediocre show with the rare good episode. It will be a show I never re-watch."
tt0092455,"People that watch science fiction seem to forget that Star Trek: The Next Generation was filmed from 1987 to 1994, and that it accomplished the breakthrough technical wizardry we now see in other sci-fi movies and television shows.It was Star Trek: The Next Generation (STTNG) that accomplished the ""orange screen"", reducing by 2/3 the cost of shooting space sequences.  It was STTNG that finally allowed for a very advanced and yet BELIEVABLE ""evolved"" human behavior involved in space travel.I admired Captain Jean-Luc Picard for his reserved Brit style, and the tension between him and Dr. Beverly Crusher.  Who did not like watching Lieutenant Commander Data and Lieutenant Geordi LaForge spar over human behavior?  What about the short brilliant life of Lieutenant Natasha Yar? Who didn't tune in to see that?  Commander William Riker was amazing to watch, as he grew a beard and a conscience -- while still being able to keep up with the great Lieutenant Worf, the only Klingon (as yet) in Star Fleet!?Those of you out there trying still to wage the Star Wars - Star Trek battle for supremacy -- grow up!  They are both inspiring stories in different universes."
tt0092455,"I've watched this in 2019 and at the beginning i was sceptical because it felt so dated and cheesy but man i'm glad i've endured season 1 because what i got was really smart and well written science fiction and not the explosion action filled one we get nowdays. This show is about the ethical and moral dilemma of future civilization exploring space. While some episode are clearly filler they are still really watchable thanks to the amazing cast of characters you end up caring about, even secondary ones i really didn't like i ended up caring and rooting for them. The good episodes on the other hand are really some of the best television i've ever seen, they put the crew in really thought provoking situations with most of the time a satisfying ending. I really reccomend this show to anyone that is even a little bit interested in science fiction and if you are scared by the colossal lenght of this show since it's basically a collection of adventures the enterprise goes through you can also watch the best rated episodes even though i reccomend watching the whole show."
tt0092455,"Even after decades this is still the best TV show ever made.
Roddenberry's vision for the future of humanity serves as an outstanding everlasting inspiration. And the show is enjoyable and has so many facets and layers so even after watching it for the 10th time it always gives something new and deep to think about."
tt0092455,"I have been hooked on this show ever since I rented a couple of episodes on video over 10 years ago. The series was shown on Norwegian Television, but they stopped it at the end of the forth season. I then bought the whole series, one season after another on DVD. I watched all the episodes, and I realized how great this show is. Over the course of the series, the characters deepen and it gets to be more and more interesting. There is the mishap of the second season, but although it was the worst season, it did have some very good episodes, like 'The Measure of a Man' and 'Q Who?'. I have seen this show now five times from start to finish (and I think that will be seeing much more), but I have found that the episodes which are much action oriented, like the double episode 'Chain of Command', was quite boring. I love episodes like 'Darmok', 'The Inner Light', 'Disaster', 'The Nth Degree', 'First Contact' and 'Who Watches The Watchers?' where the crew meet new races or find themselves in a situation that they are not used to.This is a series that can be appealing to people who like to see action in their science fiction and people who like to see, meet and know new races in their science fiction. This was a fantastic show."
tt0092455,"In fact, Star Trek Next Generation (STNG) was & continues to be IMHO, the very best Star Trek series since the original Kirk / Spock series.I Genuinely believe that STNG, Unlike Star Trek Discovery, Picard, and Star Trek Strange new worlds, was / is far better, due to the fact that it stuck firmly to the original writing and ideas of the great Gene Roddenberry!.Yes, it is true to say that STNG did suffer somewhat script wise, after Roddenberry's death.That said, generally speaking the script writers did return to the Roddenberry original Next Generation format.Actors such as Patrick Stewart (Captain Jean- Luc Picard), Levar Burton (Geordi Laforge), Marina Sirtis ( Deanna Troi), Michael Dorn ( Lt. Worf), Gates Mc Fadden ( Dr. Beverly Crusher) Colm Meaney ( Miles O' Brien) and the ever annoying Jonathan Frakes ( Lusty Cmdr Riker), Brent Spiner (Lt. Cmdr Data) and Wil Wheaton (Wesley Crusher).Brought together some exceptionally great actors, some more annoying and some who, like Colm Meaney and Michael Dorn were given far less good lines, than their skill set and characters actually deserved.Despite this, Star Trek next generation was generally well scripted, with only few exceptions to the rule.Nevertheless, over all STNG was and even in 2022, continues to be watched by Trekkies and holds a very important place in the hearts of fans!.It is considered to be the ONLY genuine Star Trek series which comes close to the original series!.All in all, a very deserving 9 out of 10 for Star Trek Next Generation the series.A final Thank You!, to one actor who is sadly very often overlooked, when it comes to admiration of STNG acting skills.I therefore mention Majel Barret, as without her wonderful voice STNG would NOT have been such a great experience. Majel was the voice actor, who voiced the vessel computer and her unmistakable voice is constantly heard throughout 104 episodes.Sadly, Majel passed away in 2008 at the age of 76.She had multiple Star Trek-related roles, though she is mostly remembered for her roles as Nurse Christine Chapel in ""Star Trek: The Original Series"" (1966-1969), as Lwaxana Troi ( Mother to Deanna Troi) in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" (1987-1994) and ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" (1993-1999)."
tt0092455,As a late stater who is of 22 years of age and has never watched a star trek series in my life and has been a life long fan of star wars.This series's has changed my entire perception of star trek. I would never of thought i would love this. as I thought it was too slow paced. But the complexity of theses characters and the overall development. Has completely taken me by surprise. Even if you are not a star trek fan. I would definitely ask you to check this out
tt0092455,"I read somewhere that Patrick Steward is proud of the educational role Star Trek – The Next Generation had over young viewers. I'm glad he enjoyed his work just as much as we did, because it had indeed quite an influence on me as a child. I practically grew up with the Enterprise crew, and Captain Picard was one of my role-models. Even now, revisiting the series restores my belief that the world will get better. After all these years, TNG is still so much fun, even more so. In a media landscape full of violence of all kinds, Star Trek – The Next Generation is something to treasure. It's that unique 'feel-good' vibe, the funny make-ups, wild scenarios and holodeck escapism, that make it a magic, timeless adventure. An ode to diversity, exploration, friendship and growth, TNG is the evidence that true values can be affirmed in a manner that is both educational and great fun. Gene Rodenberry had an admirable vision of the future...The series stayed faithful to the characters until the end, and it's a miracle that it didn't ""jump the shark"", which seems to be the fate of all successful series, for some reason. STNG just got better and better with each season until its final episode, thanks to Patrick Stewart's growing involvement in the production, script and character development. Rarely do we see a truly gifted actor with such dedication to his craft.Among all characters, Captain Picard shines with his tremendous commanding presence, wisdom and moral stature. Patrick Stewart's talent, professionalism and commitment to the role are that one thing holding everything together. My favorite episodes include ""Chain of Command"" with the memorable Ronny Cox as a non-villainous antagonist, ""The Big Good Bye"" and ""The Measure of a Man"". There are many, countless others that are just as good, in fact I love them ALL."
tt0092455,"I've watched every episode of this show tens of times. And I never get bored of it. Though some people may not be as easy to please as me, I can guarantee that you will like it.This series was my childhood, and helped turn me into the person I am today. I will never stop loving this series."
tt0092455,Thus series represents the relaunch of Trek on TV and produced some much beloved characters. It also was home to some of the absolute worst Trek episodes ever made... I find both Voyager and DS9 have aged better. DS9 especially.
tt0092455,"Where to begin? The characters in ST:TNG were just dreadful. The crew was a collection of shiny, happy, perfect, cold fish, with no depth, no passions that ever seemed more than a put-on, and who were evocative of nothing--the sort of people you'd send millions of miles away just to get rid of them. This was probably inevitable, given the circumstances of their creation. Most of them weren't created as ""characters"" at all, but were conceived as nothing more than line-item gimmicks--an empath, a Klingon, a teenager, a Pinnochio-modeled android, a blind man at the helm.Whatever glue Gene Roddenberry was sniffing at the time convinced him that the last--a blind man leading them--was a *fantastic* metaphor (luckily, cooler heads later prevailed, and the blind guy was packed off to Engineering).Most of the show's significant elements were cannibalized from earlier projects. Storywise, a gap of about 80 years is supposed to exist between the original series and TNG, but they're still using exactly the same technology, in the time of TNG, as they were in the original. All of the same equipment, with all of the same capabilities and limitations; technology hasn't advanced an inch in eight decades. TNG's one technological ""innovation"" was the holodeck, and even it was lifted from the ST: Phase One project from the '70s (which had mutated into ST: The Motion Picture, sans holodeck). That project also provided two of the other TNG characters: Will Riker was Will Decker from STP1, with Troi as the Ilia-modeled empath with whom he'd formerly had a relationship.TNG also cannibalized the original series for stories. The first season of TNG was littered, from beginning to end, with plots and other elements lifted directly from the original. This unmotley crew of gimmicks spent their first season blandly going where the first Enterprise crew had gone before. The show improved significantly later but its major defects were structural, and stayed with it throughout (which is why it's so hard to watch in re-runs). The improvements shouldn't be overstated, either: TNG ran for 8 seasons, and if one were to extract all the good-to-great episodes from the entire run, there wouldn't be enough to fill a single season. I found much of it unwatchable when first running, and it holds up even worse on second viewings. Overall, just a really awful idea, done, for the most part, badly.The writers also seemed genuinely committed to the notion--and this is one of the things I hated most about TNG--that meaningless technobabble is a substitute for competent writing. The ultimate outcome of what seemed like dozens of episodes hinged on whether a polymorphic induction framistat could be made to generate a positronic field, or whether Geordi and the robot could rejigger a 10 power electron thingamabob to elliptically convert alpha waves into magnetized mercury particles.""Make it so, Number One."" And he does, and the universe is saved. Except that's really, really stupid, and unengaging. This was a problem TNG never overcame."
tt0804503,"Mad Men was such a terrific show that is absolutely just as good as everyone says it is. I never watched it when it was originally on but after hearing so many great things about it I finally gave it a chance and streamed it. I was blown away but how much I loved it. There's a reason it won so many awards when it was on...because it's terrific! The acting, writing, directing, production, attention to detail, etc are all among the best in television history! I can see why some people may not like it because it does starts off a little slow but give it a few episodes because it absolutely pays off and then you won't want to stop watching it until you binge the entire series!"
tt0804503,"When I started watching Mad Men, the rhythm of it felt slow.Pretty quickly did I realize how much more powerful the slow story & plot development rhythm would be, allowing us to discover the characters, mostly in seasons 1 and 2, and then really be in the thick of it in subsequent seasons.Indeed, this series has pushed character development so far that they are the entire and only reason why this series is interesting. The actual events happening at the advertising agency is a pretext to throw more things at those characters and have them deal with it. In fact, the characters are so interesting that there is practically no violence needed (except a few minor events) over 7 seasons to keep this series going. I find that tremendously respectable to be able to craft a series in this way, not using gun shots and bombs to make it lively.Finally, I have not lived in the early 60's time period the series is set in, but I can only say that it's all seemed to me very interesting and all these ""vintinge"" props and costumes, hair style and such made it all the more fascinating to watch.Absolutely great work."
tt0804503,"Mad Men is one of my favorite shows ever. It was one of the most talked about shows when it was on, it's the reason I started watching it. I wanted to see if the show could live up to all the hype surrounding it and it did. It surpassed my expectations in every way. It actually ended up being one of my favorite shows. The entire cast is brilliant but this is Jon Hamm's show. His character, Don Draper, is iconic. Hamm was so good that he was nominated for an Emmy for all seven seasons the show was on and even won for best male actor. The show itself was also nominated for an Emmy for best drama for all seven seasons and even won a few times. In all the show won 16 Emmys and had over 116 different nominations. I'll say that again in case you thought it was a misprint...Mad Men was nominated for 116 different Emmy awards! That alone should tell you how legendary this show is. I love it so much I plan on watching it all the way through again in the near future."
tt0804503,"The brilliance is all in the subtext. There are many hilarious moments that are only funny if you've been paying attention and understand where the character is coming from. There are also many tragic moments that would pass you by if you didn't know what came before. Many lines have double or even triple meanings. Watch this from the beginning, with a friend. Believe me, you will want to discuss each episode afterward to figure out some of the nuances of what happened.The main Mad Man is the confident womanizer Don Draper, who is head of the Creative department at a mid-sized ad agency in 1960s Madison Avenue. I admit, at first I kind of hated him, but as the viewer learns more about him and his past, I learned to - not love him exactly - but like him and want to watch him endlessly. He is a complicated character who can be a very good man, but also a very bad man.Don Draper is joined by a rich cast of supporting characters, many of whom deserve a show of their own: The ambitious young Campbell who is utterly sleazy most of the time, but has occasional moments of growth and even cuteness.Peggy Olson starts out as Draper's secretary, but her growth into a strong, confident woman mirrors what is happening for Woman in the 60's. Silver fox Stirling - he may be morally bankrupt but gets some of the best lines. I could go on . . .The 60's clothes, hairstyles, decor, and current events provide an interesting backdrop for what is essentially a character piece. The setting provides both the occasional laugh (cigarettes being advertised as ""healthy"") and the more than occasional cringe (how could dumping trash from a picnic in the park right on the grass ever seem okay?!).If you need fast-paced action or a laugh track, this definitely isn't the show for you. But, if you like character development and subtlety in your television shows, rent the first seasons on DVD and settle in. You won't regret it."
tt0804503,"The journey is a most interesting one in Don Draper's universe that occupies a time (1960s) in American culture when changes occurred in warp speed. No Pollyanna view of the world, 'Mad Men' explores the full spectrum of human relationships, personality types, and emotions.The show's creator Matthew Weiner (previously executive producer/writer of 'The Sopranos') takes viewers on a high-ball roller coaster of human experiences that explore pursuit of bliss, the depths of where one can go, and the winding roads of inner angst one must often travel.'Mad Men' is the ultimate ensemble drama series with grown-up adult themes that drill deep into the human psyche and often self-destructive behavior patterns of the 1960s post-WWII Greatest Generation that populated the high-flying, high-pressure Madison Avenue ad agencies.Those ad agencies created the culturally iconic images cast through television, radio and print media during that turbulent, mass-consumption decade in American society, when Baby Boomers started taking over the reigns of influence in America, much of it in conflict with Greatest Gen thinking.There is nothing low key about 'Mad Men'. Tension and conflict is layered throughout the series. Weiner covers a lot of territory of the human experience that exists inside complex personalities and their relationships, and the intense emotions that often accompany them.As it stands now, 'Mad Men' is the best TV drama series of all-time; I don't believe there is even a close second.The show received 4 consecutive ""Outstanding Drama Series"" Emmys (21 total Emmy wins out of 116 nominations) to close out it's relatively brief pre-determined tenure of 7 seasons.Those who have seen every episode in sequence, experience a level of high-quality TV viewing that sets the bar to the pinnacle, and rivals the best theatrical movies in production, casting, acting, and story-telling.Matthew Weiner's unique concept alone puts it into a must-try category.For those who have seen the entire series, it is even better the second, third time around (and one gains value in more rapid linear viewing, rather than having to wait months to see the next season, or a week to watch the next episode).Marathon binge-viewing of consecutive episodes can be exhausting, but the series' irresistible gravitational force inevitably draws you back into the center of Draper's universe to watch the next episode - You just can't look away.View 'Mad Men' from episode one, season one. The trip is well worth the time.👍👍"
tt0804503,"Everyone has a back burner watchlist of TV shows considered to be the greatest. These are often graced by the likes of Breaking Bad, Deadwood, The Wire, The Sopranos, and, of course, Mad Men. Even though these shows may be indeed great, you may be familiar with a weird avoidance mechanism that usually kicks in: we may regard those landmark pieces of TV not very exciting, especially if they are a few years old - not unlike ""must-read"" literary classics that nobody ever reads - and thus we relegate them to the bottom of our watchlists, while we consume the latest, more exciting, and often less fulfilling offers.Then, when you finally make the effort to watch that landmark series and realize it is every bit as good as everyone said it was, you flagellate yourself thinking why you held back for so long.This Great-TV-Show-Avoidance-Mechanism happened to me in regards to Mad Men. A show about advertising and corporate people did not seem very exciting to me, and I wasn't really a fan of anyone in the cast (save Elizabeth Olson). Having in the past started to watch best-of-all-time TV shows just to drop them along the way - I'm looking at you, The Sopranos - I kept it on the back burner for a very long time. Now, after consuming all of Mad Men in a relatively short amount of time, I think it is the most consistently good TV show I have ever watched.Out of the 92 episodes in the entire series on IMDb, I have rated only two a 7. All the rest got a rating of either 8 or 9 (I don't believe in perfection, so 9 is as high as I go). The key word here, alongside consistency, is even-handedness. Even though there are standout episodes, usually popping out unpredictably within seasons, rather than near the end like most other shows, Mad Men's episodes are so well balanced in terms of drama, character development and plot advancement that you feel you are witnessing interesting lives go by - extremely well costumed, photographed, written and acted lives, but fictional nonetheless.
Compared to most other shows, there is a refreshing under-reliance on plot twists and melodramatic acting scenes, which now seem to me like the bluntest tools in the writer's bag of tricks to keep viewers tuning in every week. Perhaps Mad Men's greatest achievement is just that: through the power of character and acting alone, it manages to capture the viewers' interest while dispensing with more traditional tricks of storytelling. Of course, other facets of the production, such as the attention to period detail, costume design and cinematography are really good too. But what stands out and keeps us watching is the near-perfect marriage between solid writing, first, and solid acting, second - acting here defined in terms of how perfectly the actors inhabit their roles, not the showy, larger-than-life, award-stealing acting scenes you find in Oscar bait films. And I tell you from experience, the binge pull of the series makes it nearly impossible to watch a single episode in a sitting. I have only been able to pull that off once, with the final episode.The way the plot is handled is simply masterful. For instance, if a character goes on a quest to achieve something, and we spend some time witnessing the build-up to it, it is not guaranteed they will (ever) succeed, or that at least a lesson will be learned at the end of the day. Things may end up just like they are - a lot like real life. The backdrop of US history unfolding is neither overpowering, i.e., stealing attention from the characters or events at hand, or just a side note mentioned without consequence. These historically-inspired scenes excel in revealing interesting takes on people's attitudes (secretaries crying over Marilyn Monroe's death, for instance) while providing startling contrasts to our times.
Another striking feature of the show I'd like to mention is that, now and again, there are a few scenes with unimportant characters - like a child doing something they ought not to do, feeling guilty, and trying to hide it afterwards - that seem to be there mostly to make us feel, ""yes, I have felt this before, this is familiar to me"". Those ""snippets of reality,"" as I call them, serve no narrative purpose whatsoever and don't even advance our understanding of the characters, but they do a great deal to establish the mood and reinforce our connection to the characters, even if indirectly. By including these moments in small amounts and in the right moment, the writers are still able to keep everything on track while disregarding the common writing advice that every scene should either advance the plot or deepen character development (or better yet, both at the same time). By the way, I have rarely seen such ""extraneous"" scenes elsewhere, and when they do appear, they are due mostly to an editor or writer's incompetence rather than to the command of their craft.On top of all that, the show is also a wonderfully honest piece of television. It does not promise or deliver anything more than what you see on screen. After a couple of seasons, you are likely to be able to predict to a high degree of accuracy how it is all going to end - Mad Men operates within such a well thought out ""narrative system"", with clearly defined bounds, that you know exactly what NOT to expect. The way the series finale begins and ends makes you feel like you are watching just another episode and, miraculously, still manages to satisfy.In closing, I should note that Mad Men does not provide the blockbuster-y thrills of, say, Game Thrones before it became a catastrophic failure, Westworld in its first season, or Breaking Bad during the Gus Fring phase. Above all, it shows that it is entirely possible to make great, often magnificent, television without any sort of sensationalized acting, clichéd dialogue or narrative acrobatics. I have already completely forgotten Game of Thrones and don't plan on rewatching any time soon. I find it unlikely I will ever do the same to Mad Men."
tt0804503,"One of the greatest shows ever made. The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Game of Thrones, Mad Men. That's it. That's the list. If you haven't watched this show you're missing one of the absolute best shows ever made. Top notch acting, costume design, writing, acting, period piece. Watch it."
tt0804503,"This is a perfect show in every sense. The opening credits & animated intro are themselves works of art, and the creative direction makes the series so visually exquisite that you can't take your eyes off the screen even for a moment lest you miss one of the many perfect vignettes. The haunting opening music sets the stage for masterful sound design, ranging from each episode's musical selections to the subtlest of ambient sounds. The camera-work is nothing short of stunning; it loves each character and makes even the background action interesting. Talented cast and every character is watchable & believable.For a period piece, 'Mad Men' is remarkably fresh. The show is set in 1960, following a decade of post-WWII recovery which, with the help of rampant consumerism, transformed America from an industrial society into a ""leisure society"". One of the most rewarding things about the show is how we get to witness the many cracks which had already begun to form in the manicured facade of the '50s, slowly making way for America's rebellion against the manufactured ""good life"", and resulting in the social & political upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s.We get to have intimate glimpses into the various components of this process--money, power, politics, sex, race, gender roles-- in a way that makes us feel as if we're actually there in the room with the characters. The show also does a magnificent job of portraying the simultaneous liberation and objectification of women as consumerism rapidly transformed their role in society.Each and every well-developed character on this show takes his/her turn to unfold in delicate layers. This unfolding is done with pin-point precision and subtlety, and without ever spoon-feeding us. And every new nugget of information is a highly relevant piece of this very addictive puzzle.~NN"
tt0804503,"I'll be the first to admit that Mad Men is a show about watching people go to work and live their lives. It should be dull and uninteresting, yet somehow it managed to grip me for a whole 7 seasons and left me wanting more.The setting is a big part of it. The historical interest of the time (JFK's assassination, the moon landing, England winning the World Cup, to name a few key points in the show) is enough to keep many gripped. It's more than that though. The characters in themselves are worth following and you get invested in them as the seasons progress.To be frank I didn't like the first season. I just didn't get the formula and was getting close to giving up on the show. I'm glad I didn't though as it only improves from the second season onward."
tt0804503,"Mad Men is one of the best-written and most ambitious TV shows in some  time. It is worth close study, not just for learning how to create a  well-structured show but also how to write one that is truly original  and potentially groundbreaking.  Story world, or arena, is one of the key structural elements in any TV  drama (see the TV Drama Class for how to create this element, as well  as the other essential structural elements of a successful show). It is  where the story takes place and it usually exists within some specific  arena that not only delineates a recognizable unit but also has a set  of rules, activities and values that defines the characters.  One of the strengths of Mad Men is its story world. Instead of the  usual arena of cops, lawyers, or doctors, Mad Men takes us into a  Manhattan advertising agency in 1960. Besides being totally unique in  TV, this story world is extremely detailed. And the detailing isn't  simply a matter of the set design, which is fabulous. It is written  into every episode. The writers weave all manner of cultural icons of  the late 50s-early 60s, including TV shows, ads, and fashion.  This has two great advantages. One is the pleasure of recognition. If  you were a kid at that time, as I was, the show is a virtual time  machine. And even if you weren't, the authenticity and texture immerse  you in the world and make you feel that ""You are there!"" The other  great advantage is that this past world tricks the audience into  believing that this is how it really was back then. The first thing we  notice when we see all of these details is how much the world has  changed. Everybody smoked back then. The men were in charge and the  women were all secretaries and housewives. That sets up the kicker. By  first thinking how much we've changed, we then realize, with even more  impact, all the ways we haven't. This story, set in 1960, is really  about today, or more exactly, the ways that human nature only puts on a  new skin and the same fundamental challenges of creating a meaningful  life must be faced by each of us, every moment of every day.  Another structural element that immediately jumps out at you if you  want to create a TV show or write for one is the desire line. In Mad  Men the desire that structures each episode is fairly nebulous, and  that's probably going to cut into the show's popularity (I hope I'm  wrong on this one). Desire is the main reason almost all TV shows are  set in the cop, lawyer, and doctor arenas. These jobs give their shows  a simple and repeatable desire line that tracks the episode every week.  Catch the criminal. Win the case. Save the life. But of course this is  extremely limiting. Most people don't spend their daily lives solving  crimes, prosecuting bad guys, and saving lives.  So while the desire line on this show may be more nebulous, it is far  closer to what most Americans do in their daily lives. These Mad Men  are in the business of selling, which, as Arthur Miller pointed out  long ago, is the archetypal American action. But they aren't selling a  particular product. They're selling desire, some image of the good life  that, because it is a fabricated ideal, is always just out of reach.  Writer Matthew Weiner's brilliant conception for this show is to  connect the selling of desire to America to the personal and work lives  of the ad men themselves. The ad men want the image of the good life in  America that they are selling to be true, even if they intellectually  make fun of the poor suckers out there who buy it. Main character Don  Draper is handsome and talented, with a beautiful wife and two cute  little kids. But he has some secrets he's keeping  like a mistress in  the city  and he feels a terrible void he has no idea how to shake.  Draper is a master at manipulating desire and creating facades, so when  he tries to live the promise for real, the ""good life"" falls apart in  his hands.  We are in Far from Heaven and American Beauty territory here. And the  second episode even had Draper give his own version of the  Existentialist credo of Sartre and Camus that was seeping into pop  culture during the late 50s (how's that for a sweet detail on a TV  show?). We'll have to see whether Mad Men can extend beyond a few  episodes without imploding. Besides the lack of a clean desire line,  the subject of hollow suburban existence will make it extremely  difficult for the writers to develop the show over the long term  without beating a spiritually dead horse. In the meantime, I'm going to  sit back and enjoy some great dramatic writing, and nowadays TV is the  only place you'll find it."
tt0804503,"The central character in this show is a deeply damaged man called Don. He has a strong survival instinct, but he's incapable of loving or even trusting. He is running scared. He compensates for his insecurity and emptiness by pursuing primal things that soothing his ego. He has to feel that he's in control, even though he's living on the edge. He tries to be the ""Alpha Male"" conquering all around him. In reality, he is a juggler about to drop all the balls.The others in this show are complex human beings whose characters dictate how their lives evolve and ultimately end up.One interesting character that you follow throughout the series is Peggy. She enters the world of advertising as a total innocent, but as the show progresses, you'll see her become a worldly and powerful business woman.The show is full of examples of the attitudes and mindset of the 1960s. The type writer was designed ""so even a woman can learn how to use it"". Everybody smokes, a lot. It's ok for kids to play with plastic bags over their heads. Women are treated in a way that would surely be considered sexual harassment in today's world. These unacceptable things jump out at you and startle you, and give you a flavor of that era.The show was a hit for a reason. It's very good!"
tt0804503,"Just finished the finale. My husband & I watched this over the last few months. I felt like I was reading a book. Character development, story lines, sets, period pieces, costume & design, acting, writing, all top notch. I will miss this show. I may have to rewatch again some time! So good."
tt0804503,"The story line is very attractive. A group of fearless people that enjoy what they do and are really good at it. Stories that grow and develop, even with the smallest details including secrets, flaws, huge screw-ups which makes the characters very realistic and easy for the viewer to feel related to.
But...series deserved a better ending. Last season feels forced, like if the producer run out of budget last minute and they needed to close the show early.
Overall the series is one of those you love watching like a soap. Not really one of those that you just can´t wait for them to release the next episode, but still you do want to know what happens next. But the ending, it´s just not fare AT ALL with the all of the efforts made to create characters that got to you. I think the directors thought the ending was closer to life, than to give them a spectacular ending or a sounding close....whatever the thoughts they may have had, personally, they just screw 7 seasons with those final episodes."
tt0804503,"I first started to watch Mad Men when it was in its fifth season or so. I gave up in the second or third season because I didn't find it particularly interesting or engaging. Now that the entire series is on Netflix I decided to try again and watch the whole thing no matter what. My initial take on the show hasn't changed.Having worked on several, I recognize a soap when I see one. People are so dazzled by the show being set in the 60's and the effects it has on set design, costume and hairstyle. And the setting is fun, with people smoking everywhere and office workers drinking like sailors on shore leave. But once the novelty wears off, the storylines are straight out of soap operas and the only thing more flat than the characters is the dialogue. And despite the show's attempt to be racy with its many, many sex scenes, in the end it's very chaste since it's on basic cable. Not a female nipple in sight, with blankets being pulled up to the armpits one split second post coitus and one swear word per show or season. Clutch the pearls and get the smelling salts.The show is obsessed with Jews for obvious reasons, but it gets pretty old after a while. What else have you got? For a show trying so hard to be progressive, I find it somewhat amusing that the only religious and ethnic minorities which Hollywood (not only this show) deems worthy of attention are Jews and blacks. Perhaps it's because of the era the show is set in, but most likely not.Don Draper has got to be one of the least interesting main characters in television. Having other characters commenting on how mysterious he is doesn't make him an interesting character. Forget for a minute how dashing Jon Hamm is playing him: Aside from screwing every woman who enters his field of vision and being afraid of his (not so terribly engaging) secret to come out, what does Don Draper want? After watching 92 episodes I still can't answer this basic question.Evident from the plot point about his contract, it's clear he doesn't want to be tied down. So why did he choose to get married? And twice at that. In fact, why does he choose to work in advertising? He seems to enjoy neither his work nor his marriage(s). He just sort of trundles along sticking his weiner into any woman who happens to cross his path. I don't think there's anything wrong with Hamm's portrayal. It's just that he's given very little to work with. One character says the following to Don in the last season: ""You don't have any character, you're just handsome!"". I'm sure it was meant as a tongue in cheek joke by Weiner et al, but it accidentally summed up Don Draper to me. He's meaningless.But singling out Don is unfair, most of the characters are one note. The acting is for the most part serviceable, with some notable exceptions. Vincent Kartheiser playing Pete is one example. It's not that I don't like the character, it's just that not a single moment (especially in the latter seasons) rings true.But the prime example has got to be January Jones as Betty. I'm sorry to be piling on, because she has already gotten a lot of flak, but this is possibly the stiffest acting I have seen in a high budget project. She certainly looks the part, being a dead ringer for Grace Kelly, but every single line reading comes off as her reading from the phone book. But wait, it gets worse. In a move of blatant nepotism Matthew Weiner's son is cast as Glen, a boy with a dead-eyed thousand yard stare and all the likeability and charm of a serial rapist who crosses paths with the Draper household. The scenes he shares with Betty (of which there are many) are nothing but torture. One got cast because of her looks, the other because of his DNA, and neither one could act their way out of a paper bag."
tt0804503,"I also am utterly bemused to see so many negative comments on this show. I haven't taken to a TV drama so much since 'Our Friends in the North' (UK only I think) For those who seem to think the show is about pointing out the improved morals of the 21st century, or don't catch the story lines as being evolved enough, or think the characters shallow - I'm afraid you're missing the (beautifully painted) picture completely.Mad Men oozes. It oozes class, style, sophistication, cinematic production, dreaminess and the wow factor. It seeps into your mind. It doesn't leave you alone, lingering around the corners of your mind for hours afterwards.As a bonus (as if all this wasn't enough) you've got Don Draper (Jon Hamm). If there's a better cast character, being better acted elsewhere on television in the 21st century then I missed it. The fact that Don is also, or used to be Dick, just adds to the dreaminess.It's gorgeous, just enjoy."
tt0804503,"Set in the changing world of advertising in the 1960s this series is centred on the employees of one agency as they work to gain new contracts and maintain the ones they have and deal with take-overs and buy-outs. There are many major characters but most important is Don Draper; a man with the magic touch in his business who is far from perfect; he cheats on his wife, drinks rather too much and has a secret that could get him in a lot of trouble if it came to light. We also have Peggy Olsen; a secretary who quickly becomes the only woman on the creative team; office manager Joan Harris; the ambitious Pete Campbell and Roger Sterling, the somewhat amoral partner with an eye for the ladies. The series doesn't only follow the characters at work; we see their home lives; Don's family, particularly his wife Betty and daughter Sally, are as important as his colleagues.If you are looking for action and expect stuff to happen all the time this might not be for you; but if you want a great character led drama that really captures the feel of the era in which it is set then this might be just what you are looking for. The characters might not be the most likeable but their flaws make them feel real. The ongoing story nicely incorporates the news stories that would affect the national consciousness at the time as well as the changing attitudes to race and sexuality. The cast is superlative; most obviously John Hamm who is great as Don but Elisabeth Moss, Christina Hendricks, Vincent Kartheiser, January Jones and John Slattery whose characters stand out. Kiernan Shipka deserves separate mention as she does a great job as Sally; a role she started when she was about six years old. The series provides plenty of drama but also a good number of laughs and one gory shock involving a lawnmower and a foot! Overall I would definitely recommend this superior series."
tt0804503,"When I saw the 8.5, I had to comment on why it wasn't a 10. Holy crap! Come on people! Talk about a series that sucked us in and had us always wanting more!!! Well, it as a 10 in my book."
tt0804503,"This is truly one of the best drama series in the history of television as it has everything a drama should have: great characters and ensemble cast, superb writing, mind blowing sets and costumes. It's a character driven story that follows Don Draper and the people around him for ten years from 1960 to 1970 and the writing in these 7 seasons have been interesting and enjoyable to follow. Matthew Veiner created a piece of art with his unique and spectacular writing, mixing fiction with non fiction made him get freedom and with that he could create the many characters that the show has to offer and they are all realistic and believable characters, it's some of the best characters in a show that I've seen.How Matthew Veiner and his crew have recreated New York in its 60's have been something incredible to see as it's detailed from the clothes that the people wear to how they act and the whole world has a feeling that is hard to capture but the crew behind Mad Men succeeded.
So what are you in for if you choose to watch this piece of art, more than one of the best drama's in TV history you get to see the fine acting of the whole ensemble cast and mostly Jon Hamm, the man that plays Don Draper, everyone did incredible and emmy worthy performances."
tt0804503,"I must admit I'm more likely to be shocked how many users find this drama dull.I remember the night I had the chance to gaze at one of episodes for couple of minutes.Betty posing for a coke ad didn't seem charming or appealing to me at all, I changed the channel...Long after the series won the Emmies, beautiful tunes of David Carnobora buzzed into my ear via commercials and I thought I might have to get the complete DVD.HBO absolutely made their worst business move maybe in their history by dissing this show.Cos Made Men is clever, cool, charismatic, sexy but more over it's targeting the audience HBO has created over years.Not random Americans who switch between Idol, a weirdo doctors unpleasant patients who will recover thanks to him or ugly police officers digging a carpet for a strand to discover a guy who you already know committed a homicide.OK lemme tell you about why I adore this show.Mad Men is ultimately written by people who has a giant caliber of creativity and talent.This show demands the audience to be careful, tedious, curious about what they are watching.This show is not to be figured out in a single episode.After I completed season one I had some feeling towards what Weiner had in his mind while pitching the series to channel executives.Do not let the name fool you, Mad Men is not about ad- business or copywriters, show merely talks about ads, even when they are doing an ad.It is about America, how America transferred itself -and the world which depended on it- through out the sixties.In which manners capitalism can market itself with big lies.By showing us the differences between 60's and 2000's series easily projects ideas about our time during a past decade.Characters in the show are so real, then I mean not just protagonist Don Draper, every other big, tiny or one time characters gets his/her time on screen and therefore show builds up a magnificent universe which you believe it exits and roam safely.Mad Men is not show yelling or speaking out loud, it politely whispers...We the audience witness a group of peoples lives in NYC, Matthew Weiner cleverly puts mile stone political, social events of USA balanced with everyday life of people as well, balanced fastidiously.The one biggest disappointing down side of Mad Men is that there are almost zero on-location shootings.We never get to see the - city- or anything else.This gives the feeling of being locked in sometimes for the viewer.Cast is totally cool and sexy with their superb retro wardrobe.Jon Hamm is the perfect choice for a lead, January Jones is so sexy that you can't get her out of your mind.Smokey, brownish production design is sweet and elegant.Also soundtrack selecting is so much joyful.I can't say Mad Men is an easy chew.You have to be patient also alert.As I sad you can get a clear feeling only after watching an entire season.Do you want to watch the same TV shows over seasons or want some fun, intelligent brain gymnastics ? The codes of Mad Men are there to decode for your own sake.Do not miss it..."
tt0804503,Mad Men is the kind of show you want to watch if you are having doubts of your career and life.The characters and perfectly developed and none of them fall flat. The show is real and crude and portrays many aspects of the professional and personal life of a person.Some episodes are flat and some scenes are not necessary but this show is something to look at.
tt0804503,"Don is broken. But in the outside he's unbreakable.A slow burn with great story telling and cinematography leads to a top 5 show of all time.The period piece depicts the pure madness of New York and ad agencies where the winner decides how the consumer will perceive a brand. The product doesn't matter it's the message and the way something is perceived that matters. Not much has changed since then.Love, war, violence, money, hate and greed all heavy present themes.Less words are better says Madmen writers. Quiet and subtle moments make the biggest impacts all set alongside the strong but tormented Don.Superior casting, writing and set results in a show for the ages that stands the test of the times."
tt0804503,"I don't watch TV drama usually, with rare exceptions: The Sopranos (especially the early seasons) and Entourage, if that counts. Mad Men is one of the most original, refreshingly dark and complex shows I've ever seen on TV. Despite its potential for soap opera story lines, it consistently transcends expectations and explores fascinating characters and a radically changing social environment in a beautifully shot, artfully designed and, above all, excellently acted manner. After watching virtually no TV recently (less than three hours per week), my wife and I have been hooked all week, catching up on every episode - although we have yet to see the first, which a technical glitch in our On Demand service is holding tantalizingly out of reach. I loved Todd Haynes' Far From Heaven, and this is like a generously extended - and in some respects even more fascinating - adjunct to that. Madison Avenue is the perfect prism through which to view the early 1960s, and Mad Men, with its post-noir, Nixon/JFK/beatnik/martini melange, is a hugely enjoyable, finely measured cocktail that leaves just the right taste in the mouth."
tt0804503,"I wanted to watch Mad Men as it was recommended in a lot of websites on articles along the lines of: ""Shows you should binge watch"" The IMDb rating of 8.7 proved to further bolster that point. The problem with Mad Men is not necessarily the plot line is bad and the events that take place in the story are uncalled for and are characterised by bad writing -- it's because not a lot happens. And I really want to emphasise on that. Nothing happens. I found that watching it was just watching a cinematic recording of some guys in an advertising agency. It wasn't like a TV show where I was like, ""Cool! That would be memorable if that happened in real life!"" There was nothing exciting or anything that at least somewhat kept me on the edge of my seat whilst viewing it. After each episode, I felt no desire to watch the next one. It was just dull and mundane. A positive for the show, I'd like to point out, is the atmosphere and the 'feel' for 1960's NYC. It isn't too much and it isn't too little. It felt real. The costume designs, the environment. They were all convincing.I stopped watching Mad Men due to it's dull and mundane plot line at S03E02. I didn't get through the first two seasons by the story, like I should have, I got through them by escaping into the cool atmosphere Mad Men offered. Overall, not a bad show but not a good one either. I wouldn't recommend it. IMDb RATING: 6/10 - OKAY"
tt0804503,"... because producers seem to think that just because they portray this stylish era, they can be sloppy about the plot. One of the most frustrating things I found is that many interesting plot threads are started and are never followed up upon later (or just not enough). A lot of scenes could be just easily left out since they don't contribute to the understanding of the characters or the plot (seriously, do we really need to see Don taking a long walk across the office or smoking leisurely at a restaurant with nothing else going on?). Instead, producers could spend more time on good dialogs, because the dialogs in this show are trite for the most part.In my opinion, most people give it good ratings because either they like the era, or because it got so much attention from the media. Or they suspect that there's more to this show than they see, and maybe they just ""don't get it"". I only watched it because I heard about it on NPR. I watched the whole first season and two episodes from the second season. Each episode left me with a hollow feeling: ""And this is it?"" I'm not going to waste any more of my time on this over-hyped show."
tt0804503,"""Hey Jude,"" have you watched Mad Men yet? If not, ""Come Together"" and give it a try. ""With a Little Help From My Friends,"" I'll tell you that this show is a masterpiece. From the ""Revolutionary"" 60s-themed setting to the ""Magical Mystery Tour"" of advertising, Mad Men is a ""Day Tripper"" through the lives of the men and women who made Madison Avenue what it was.""Something"" you'll notice right away is the incredible attention to detail in the show's production design. From the ""Norwegian Wood"" furnishings to the impeccably tailored suits, everything feels like it's from the era. The ""Long and Winding Road"" that leads us through the characters' personal and professional lives is expertly crafted, with each episode offering ""A Hard Day's Night"" of drama and intrigue.One of the show's strongest elements is its characters, each with their own quirks and motivations. Don Draper is a ""Nowhere Man"" struggling with his identity, while Peggy Olson is a ""Blackbird"" rising through the ranks of a male-dominated industry. Together, they form a ""Band on the Run"" that keeps us hooked episode after episode.In conclusion, Mad Men is a ""Ticket to Ride"" that's not to be missed. Whether you're a fan of the Beatles or not, you'll find plenty to love in this ""All You Need Is Love""-filled series."
tt0758745,"Friday Night Lights is one of all-time favorite shows. It's is so criminally underrated it's ridiculous! It is just an absolute amazing show! The show is based off the book and the film but is so much better than even those two. It takes place in the small Texas town of Dillon, Texas and takes place at one of the best football high schools...the Dillon Panthers. Coach Taylor (Kyle Chandler) leads the team through pressure filled seasons full of expectations and helps his players both on and off the field. He also has to deal with the everyday struggles of his own family. Even though the football story line is great, it is so much more than that. If you read the reviews you'll see 90% of them are 9's & 10's and most have one thing in common and that's that they didn't give it a chance until years after it went off the air. Once you start watching you can't stop."
tt0758745,"I know people say this all the time about shows but Friday Night Lights really is one of the most underrated shows in the history of television. It's such a great show and should be talked about even more than it is. It's on just about every ""bests shows of all-time"" list that you'll find and for good reason. It shows the everyday lives about popular high school athletes and others members of the community in a small Texas town where football is everything. It takes a realistic, gritty look inside their lives. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special. The cast (Kyle Chandler, Taylor Kitsch, Connie Britton, Aimee Teegarden, Minka Kelly, Michael B JordanZach Gilford, Jesse Plemons, Adrianne Palicki, etc) is just about perfect for this show too. This really is a must watch show!"
tt0758745,"I can't find a strong enough word in my vocabulary to describe how spectacular and engrossing this show is. I remember when I first heard about it eight or so years ago when the show premiered. To be honest, after seeing the movie, I thought it would be cheesy and not all that good. After Breaking Bad ended, I needed a new show to watch and while searching for the best shows available on Netflix streaming, this was near the top of the list. And I can truly say even after watching something as incredible as Breaking Bad, I think this show is almost more special in its own way. It doesn't need violence and drugs to be entertaining. I remember right after watching the pilot, I couldn't stop and stayed up till 7 am watching. It will pull you in that quickly, especially if you are a football fan. Not that you cant watch it if you don't like football or don't know much about it. I absolutely love football. Love watching it and played it in high school. But football is absolutely the least interesting aspect of this show. The first episode of the series goes through each day leading up to the first game of the season. After watching it I thought every episode would be that way. But after seeing the end of the pilot I realized the show is about much much more than just football. Football is just a backdrop.The most important part of the show are the lives of the characters off the field, focusing on the head coach and his wife and their daughter, as well as the players. He is more of a father figure to these players before he is a coach. The main theme of the show is that people have dreams. It shows everyday problems that people face, which we can all relate to in one way or another. Then it shows these dreams can come true if you have someone who believes in you and is willing to help you until you reach these dreams. The show creates these characters in a pretty cliché fashion. But what makes the show so great is these characters are brought to life, making the viewer able to literally feel the emotions of these characters, even without words being spoken. For the most part, the acting is incredible by most of the cast. The way the show is shot makes you feel like you are in the room with these people. This show will move your emotions and make you laugh,cry, smile and cheer. There's not many other shows out there that can hit you with so many ranges of emotions. You really feel like you are a part of these peoples lives, and you really become connected to them. You are able to watch them change with your own eyes. You will think differently about life and football after watching it, I can guarantee that."
tt0758745,"Probably one of the best all around shows Ive ever watched. I grew up in Dallas so this really brings back some great memories of high school football. This show captures everything Texas and is such a good show. Don't worry It's not just about high school football and it touches on so many subjects I won't try and list them out. One thing is for sure though, I guarantee you will experience every emotion a human being can go through during the course of this series. If high school football is not your thing it won't matter. The writing, the directing, the music and above all the acting, will take you places no other show will take you. Yeah it's that good. Just Give it 3 episodes before you make any decisions. It takes that long to get to know the characters and get familiar with the show. When it's all over and you finish the last episode, you will sit back and say to yourself, ""crap that just might be the best series I've ever watched""... You will have Clear Eyes and Full Hearts... watch the show and you will never forget that phrase... Peter Berg well done on this one and last but not least.... Texas Forever..."
tt0758745,"Simply put, this is reality. If someone had affixed a camera to my head, 24 hours a day, when I was in high school, you couldn't have gotten a better picture of life. I know someone like every single character in this show. The story lines, the acting, the cast, couldn't be any better in this show. For those who haven't made it to high school yet, in Texas, this is your future. Wonderful, wonderful drama. I didn't even hear about this show (don't have time for much TV) until season 4. Watched one episode and I was hooked. Went out and bought every episode and sat down and watched every one in about two days. Didn't want to turn it off. I had always thought that The Shield was the best show ever on TV....until I was introduced to this tremendous story about life."
tt0758745,"This show really hit home for me. I played high school football at Polk High back in the day. This show really does capture what it was like to play varsity level high school football. There were so many similarities to my life that were in the show, be it the love interest, the drama, the ups and downs, and of course the football.I took my team to state, and thanks to my four touchdowns in that game, we won. I will remember my coach as one of the best men that I have ever met in my life; a mentor that I looked up to. Although my days of playing football are over, and I'm now a shoe salesman with two kids and a wife named Peggy, I'll always have love and respect for the game, and this series reminded me of just how beautiful the experience of high school football is."
tt0758745,I am from Australia and I could not get enough of this show.
tt0758745,"I just loved Kyle Chandler as an actor since when I was a kid from the first time I saw him perform on ""Early Edition"". I'm really glad that he won an Emmy for his role on ""Friday Night Lights"" as ""Coach Taylor"". Recently I started to watch ""Friday Night Lights"" and I just want to say that this is one of the best drama series that I've seen (and believe me when I say this 'cause I've watched lots of series)! It has every aspects of a real life story and it involves the viewer with the lives of all the characters. I wasn't a fan of American football before I watched this drama, but now I really enjoy watching football games. I recommend watching this drama series to anyone who enjoys sports and loves a very close to real life story."
tt0758745,"I only recently became hooked on this show, having obsessed for perhaps too long about a certain metaphysical fantasy set on a desert island and about a certain stylish melodrama about one man's Mafia family. This show has no gangland hits, no sixties nostalgia about Madison Avenue, no housewives( or chemistry teachers) dealing drugs, no musical numbers,no recondite references to Egyptian hieroglyphics or quantum physics. Yet despite all these terrible flaws,( clever sarcasm) it is a masterpiece. I am not anti-Lost. I enjoyed the show immensely, for all its flaws. However, this show is , in some ways, superior. It is, in fact a photo-realistic picture of life in a small town in Texas, beautifully written and wonderfully acted. I rank it with certain other shows that were overlooked and are now sadly forgotten by all but a few people with good taste: The Call To Glory, Homefront, and I'll Fly Away,among others. In some ways, this is a show worthy of the golden age of TV ""sooial drama"", Naked City, The Defenders, Mr. Novak, Ben Casey, The Fugitive( a social commentary disguised as a thriller), Route 66, Slattery's People and East Side West Side. Like the best episodes of those shows, Friday Night Lights offers more questions than answers. This show is one of the best ever. I pray to a sometimes enigmatic providence that it does not perish from the airwaves."
tt0758745,"I'm surprised by the negative comments I've seen, simply because I never noticed or was bothered by shaky camera work on this show. Perhaps I was too busy being drawn in by the fascinating, sympathetic, beautifully drawn characters and their challenges and successes. I cannot think of another show that has such believable characters and story lines. I can't remember when a show has made me care so much about the characters. I think that's because there aren't other shows that have achieved this. Friday Night Lights is very well written and well acted. The music on this show is great. I keep coming back to my love for the characters this show lets us get to know, though. This show is about much more than football, and it certainly isn't about being ""arty"" and having shaky camera work. It's about people. And darn good storytelling."
tt0758745,"The thing I really love about this show is the wardrobe. It's nice to see what lengths a wardrobe department will take to make sure the situation and people are as real as possible, such as using clothing pieces that the actors have already worn previously in episodes. Also, the acting is fantastic! I mean, the entire point of acting is to be truthful under imaginary circumstances and these actors are wonderful at accomplishing that. It's difficult to watch a show when acting is oh so obvious. I have to say though that I admire the men in this series for capturing the true love of football. I've grown up around football and seeing the same love and dedication to the sport come through in the show (and also the same feeling in the movie) is really a ray of sunshine :) Bravo!"
tt0758745,"This show is amazing! They honestly need to bring back TV shows like these and one tree hill and the o.c. Even if you aren't a football fan, believe me you will be after this show.Every character is well written and on their own path to growth which allows you to emotionally connect and invest in them.The only thing I seriously didn't like was the ending. Seriously though, that ending was a huge disappointment. I feel like they could've at least given us another episode or 2 just to make it count. It just felt very rushed towards the end.If you're into the 2000s shows like One Tree Hill, The O. C, 90210, and those then this show is for you!It's emotional, touching, and so heartfelt. Not to mention they touch on social issues which mad respect."
tt0758745,"This Wednesday, Friday Night Lights hit yet another ratings low (3.8/6 in the overnights).How is that possible if this show is so great? The answer obviously is that Friday Night Lights is very far from ""great"".In fact, it is awful, really awful.The culprit? The oft-mentioned camera work.For you see, when you can't see the action without getting a headache or nausea, you just don't keep watching the show. Whether FNL delivers a realistic view of life in a small town becomes completely irrelevant since the show is plainly unwatchable.Somehow, some incompetent producers and directors thought that shaking the camera would help their show.Maybe they should have gone back to film school instead of reading ridiculous hype in trade reviews written by incompetent critics."
tt0758745,"I'm finishing up. Was down with a knee surgery and needed something that wasn't too dark and depressing. This is a damn good show. I hate Lila though. She's is awful. Unlikeable in every single way. Tyra has shown she can act through it all. Mean, sad, scared, funny and tough. She nailed them all. Lila is just a whiny baby, and every situation is acted out the same. That disgusting fake sweet voice and talking through her teeth. Jason Street should've stayed while Lila went. He was for sure one of my favorites. Tim is one of the main reasons to keep watching. He's nice to look at and can actually act! Buddy is fat and greasy and sweaty but plays his role well! Coach and Mrs T are likable and real. Cant imagine anyone playing those roles better. Matt, well we all know a Matt. Reliable, sweet, artsy and without much confidence. Landry (pre psycho Todd from breaking bad, had no clue he was in it)was amazing! Smash redeemed himself and I was happy he was around and I LOVE his momma. Man, she was so believable in her role. Maybe a bit too much drinking and screwing for 15 year olds they could've at least held off until they were a bit older. but a damn good show! Just like in high school EVERYTHING is a cross to die on. And just like in a small town football takes precedent over EVERYTHING! Grades, kids, money you name it. Football is their only reason to wake up each day and only means of survival for many. In my town our football coach gets triple what any teacher does. It's really sad actually. So this show is very real, beautifully shot, produced like none other and just about perfect. Except for that winey ass minka Kelly. I know now why she never made it past this and others did. She was cast for her look and looks alone and they just didn't take her far enough. Not against these heavy hitters! All in all a really good drama, really good show. One that will get you in the feels on almost every episode. Glad I finally decided to watch it. And glad they didn't drag it out 10 years! So many shows drag out and end up sucking as a result...not this one."
tt0758745,"When I tuned into Friday Night Lights, I expected to find another mindless football-jock fest with shallow dramatic plots and shallow subject matter. I could not have been more wrong. Football merely frames what is an epic human drama that is raw, authentic, and shows stories that are vulnerable. The show is taking on the greatest challenge we all face universally: The Drama of Real Life. The show filming on location in Texas deepens the reality of being a fully immersive experience. The series takes you somewhere we all desperately long to be: a place with Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose."
tt0758745,"What a fantastic show. Yes, football is a huge aspect of this show, but in the way that it's a backdrop rather than the focus for the most part. I like to think of Friday Night Lights as similar to The O.C. and at the same time, completely anti-O.C. The thing about this show is, it deals with some issues that you see all the time on The O.C. - alcoholism, drugs, cheating, high school stuff...and yet, it comes off infinitely ahead of The O.C. It's in the treatment, the way they execute the story lines where the difference is, and that difference is MASSIVE. It's the difference between a guilty-pleasure borderline soap and a sophisticated and earnestly dramatic piece of film-making. This show takes those elements that could be turned into melodramatic/stereotypical clichés, that could be simplified into the escapist world of The O.C., and it manages to wring out every inch of raw emotion and drama out of them. It doesn't put its moments to waste. I really don't think I ever saw a moment of honest, real emotion in The O.C.. Friday Night Lights easily has three powerful and honest moments an episode, if not more. Besides the stuff that is similar to The O.C., the series also tackles more issues like racism, mental disorders, rape, and parent/child relationships. In fact, the two episodes that deal with racism are a great example of how FNL is so great. It showcases a lot of viewpoints from different people inside the show, and while it doesn't solve things completely (just like real life), it certainly shows more insight into the issues than most shows or movies I can think of. If Crash won an Oscar for its simplified and stereotypical view of racists and racism, the complexity in the way FNL deals with the issue should've made it the Best Picture of the century.That's not to say the stories themselves are perfect. When I step back and look back at the season of FNL, yeah, a lot of the story lines can seem at the end of the day overwrought and almost melodramatic. But that's the nature of the story lines. In the moments themselves, they are almost always written believably with perfect dialogue and acting. There are a few moments in the series where a character's turnaround or change of opinion might happen too drastically, but considering the 100 things they do right in every episode, 1 small problem like that per episode is really not much in the long run. There is always a fine line between melodrama and drama when dealing with shows about high school, and FNL hits the dramatic mark more consistently often than nearly anything else on TV or on the silver screen. The other thing is, like I said, FNL has a lot of raw and powerfully emotional moments in it. It wears its heart on its sleeve and some people may mistake that for melodrama. These are characters you care for, that are intensely real - yes, so the girls in the show may be hotter than most, the cast is good-looking, etc...but the root of the characters feels like real people. The actors feel naturalistic, and the breadth of the show is stunning. You feel like this town actually exists somewhere. It's not just about the high school kids either. This show is equally about the parents. This is a show about an entire town, a town that is in love with football, that lives for football because, well, quite simply, most of them have nothing to look forward to except for football. It really nails the closeness and intensity of living in a small town, of everyone knowing everyone, etc. If I had to use one word to describe what I think Friday Night Lights is about, it would be - dreams. This comes to the surface towards the end of the season but its always been there since the beginning. This show is about everyone's dreams, how and what everyone wants out of life, where they wanna go, where they seem themselves in the future. There are people who long for an escape from the town where there's not much of a future (Tyra), there are people with crushed dreams who have to rebuild (Jason and Lyla), there are people who are starting to live their dream (Matt), and there are people who are well on their way to their dream (Smash)...the entire show is about the struggle to follow your dreams and what that is worth. It's one of the best shows on TV and the best show that you're not watching."
tt0758745,"All these people saying the camera was too shaky? I didn't even notice. Listen, it's not our fault if you can't concentrate on something for longer than ten seconds.Most of the people who have given this poor ratings are just people who were expecting this to be a live NFL game or something. Don't listen to them. Football is an important part of the show, but it's secondary to the characters, who are deeply explored and easily related to.Do yourself a favour and watch this from the very first season until the last. You won't regret it. Oh, and NBC, please bring this show back. One of the few shows I've ever really loved."
tt0758745,"For me, Friday Night Lights is the best series ever. I just completed watching the entire series and actually felt sad when it ended. You really get to know the characters and the education of these real life situations.I'm in my 60's and wish every parent could watch this show with their kids and have discussions. Best show. Wish there were many more like it. I would even suggest schools have it viewed by students but I realize some parents would be in an uproar. But, I also believe this wonderful show would open dialog between parents and their kids and prevent so much heartache. And teachers will remember how influential they are and how they can change the direction of a youngsters life."
tt0758745,"A football show that isn't about football as much as it is about relationships that surround the game in a small Texas town where there is high school football and, honestly, not much else.Kyle Chandler is absolutely brilliant as Coach Eric Taylor, who does a lot more in Dillon, Texas than merely coach the football team. His relationship with his wife (brilliantly portrayed by Connie Britton) surely has to have them right near the top of the list as far as best husband-wife combos in TV history goes.Everything about this show clicks. Even the characters you think at the start are going to be cliched turn out rather pleasantly to be anything but. Some of the issues the show touches on - racism, small town politics, the American high school education system, the concept of your life's peak being in high school on a football field, and the spectre of a loved one affected by dementia amongst others - really elevate it. And the series finale? As perfect as perfect gets. Eleven stars out of ten."
tt0758745,"A lot of people look down on television, a view justified in part by the stream of crappy reality shows. However, when done well television is an art form that can be as great as a painting, a poem, a novel, and much much better than a film. Friday Night Lights is one of the few shows that has done just that. While football is a big part of the show, it is so much more than just a sports show. The characters are all real. They feel like someone would meet in real life. This allows us to feel connected to them. Over five seasons we get to fall in love with the small community of Dilon; we get to see teenagers grow up; we see people fall in and out of love; we get to see how much of marriage involves give and take; we get to see people make difficult decisions; and all of it makes for a show that will stay in the hearts and minds of its viewers long after it's over."
tt0758745,"The acting in this show may be good, but the cinematography is a little off. The camera will zoom in on parts that are not necessary. It makes me dizzy to watch and is hard to follow sometimes because the shot will be blurry. I agree completely with Rob Owen from the Pittsburgh Gazette when he says, ""Scenes at the football game are rough and violent, filmed in a close-up, visceral style that makes NFL games on TV appear tame by comparison."" When there are scenes from a football practice, the camera shots are quick and bounce around everywhere. I feel that David Boyd, the Director of Photography, is trying to create the element of a realistic football practice; football practices are fast-paced and full of activity. While Boyd is trying to create this element, he is making his viewers nauseous. The story lines in this show need to be rethought and rewritten. There are not many progresses in the story lines. It is like watching a soap opera, where a viewer has to watch a weeks' worth of episodes to get only one important event. For the most part, Friday Night Lights contains one important event per episode. In addition, the ""fairy tale ending"" of each episode, needs to be rethought. Every episode that I have watched has ended with the Panthers winning the game and everyone is happy. For example, the episode in which Smash (the star running back) plays horrible and Tim steps up his game to lead the team to victory. If the writers want to keep their viewers in suspense and wanting to watch the next week, they need to create a cliffhanger ending for each episode.Because important events happen in each storyline in every episode, the show needs to be watched in sequence. Like many television dramas, a viewer is likely to be lost if they do not watch each episode in sequence. A viewer will be lost jumping into Friday Night Lights because important information is revealed in each episode. I began to watch this show in the middle of the season, and I am unclear about what is going on in many of the story lines. I jumped in on an episode in which Jason was suing Coach Taylor. I was puzzled by why Jason would sue the coach, but I later found out that there has been a football accident. After watching three more episodes, I still have not figured out what the football accident is or how it involves Coach Taylor. Having a show that is not in sequence will make it hard to gain viewers. A person may start watching the show, be confused about what is going on, get frustrated, and never watch the show again. Although the show has its low points, I believe it will last for at least one more season. The story lines in the show are not all based on football; therefore, viewers will most likely get hooked on them. For example, Grey's Anatomy is a show based on the medical field, but the millions of viewers that tune in every week are not hooked on the medical element; they are hooked on the story lines and drama. People get hooked on the plots and story lines of the drama, not just the framework. Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle takes the words right out of my mouth when he says, ""If you don't care for football, or high school football in particular, or even the concerns of a bunch of high school kids and their fanatical grown-ups -- which plenty of viewers probably don't -- Berg makes you care. That's why ""Friday Night Lights"" is more than just a surprise in a crowded field of mostly good dramas.""Goodman, Tim. ""Friday Night Lights"" defies expectations and has something to offer all comers."" San Francisco Chronicle 2 Oct. 2006. 12 Jan. 2007 http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgif=/c/a/ 2006/10/02/DDGPOLFJMH1.DTL&type=tvradio.Owen, Rob. ""Friday Night Lights' isn't just about the gridiron."" Pittsburgh Post- Gazette 11 Oct. 2006. 4 Jan. 2007 http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06274/726170- 237.stm."
tt0758745,"Apparently, from what I 've read, the producers of Friday Night Lights are under the impression that shaking the camera to and fro is giving their show a sheen of ""reality"".Let me be the one who disabuses them of this notion.Shaking the camera does not add realism to a show. It actually subtracts from it. For you see, realism comes from the writing and the acting, and shaking the camera, well... it's just shaking the camera. It's annoying and detracts from whatever realism exists in the show. It also makes a lot of people reach for the remote.At this point, there are two mysteries about Friday Night Lights: 1) Why did NBC put this on the air? After all, they must have seen how unwatchable the pilot was. 2) Why is NBC still airing FNL? After all, they must have seen the ratings."
tt0758745,I don't understand why people have such a problem with the camera work. I find it truly original and I find that it really captures the whole scene- instead of just being pointed at the face of whoever is speaking.Friday Night Lights is hands down one of the best shows on TV right now. The stories are interesting and the characters are complex- not just a bunch of pretty teenagers bemoaning their dating woes. I think relationships are portrayed about as realistically as they can be on TV. I hope it makes it to another season. I am not really a big fan of network TV shows either- but this one I will not miss.
tt0367279,"As you can tell by reading through most of these reviews, Arrested Development is loved by just about everyone who's seen it. It ended only after three seasons which was way too soon for such a great show. Netflix renewed it 8yrs after it went off the air. Season 3 was in 2005 and it wasn't until 2013 until season 4 finally made its debut. But those first few seasons were so good that it didn't still have to put this among my favorite sitcoms of all-time! It's about the Bluth family and how one of the sons, Micheal Bluth (Jason Bateman), takes over the family business and affairs when his father George Bluth (Jeffrey Tambor) goes to prison. This family is so dysfunctional that they make Michaels life impossible. If you haven't seen this yet then do yourself a favor and watch it asap!"
tt0367279,"Arrested Development really is one of the funniest and most underrated tv shows ever created, especially the first three seasons! As most of the reviews have already said the quality dropped off for the last 2 seasons when it came back after taking a few years off. But those first few seasons were so good that it makes this show an all-time great sitcom!"
tt0367279,"Seasons 1-3: 10/10Season 4 (Original edit): 6/10Season 4 (Re-edit): 6/10Season 5: 6/10This show really dipped in quality once Netflix picked it up. The new seasons still have their moments, but it never lived up to the original episodes."
tt0367279,"This show takes a few episodes before you *really* GET it.  And once you get it, you'll realize why everybody thinks it's one of the best sitcoms ever.Each character is really defined and original...with real, unique personalities.  All of the actors have fantastic chemistry, making for really great interactions and relationships within the show.The writing for this show is great, and the plots are so absurd that you can't help but find them funny.  A refreshing change in a world where people like reality shows...it's the only good sitcom left."
tt0367279,"First three seasons were like best thing you could see in a sitcom ever. But from 4th season it's all going downhill. I couldn't even get through season 5.
If it wasn't for last two seasons, this show would have been my favourite sitcom."
tt0367279,"This is the funniest show currently on television. All you need to enjoy this show is an appreciation for high-quality acting and incredibly hilarious writing. Jason Bateman as Michael Bluth is perfect as the under-appreciated do-good guy who's just trying to keep his family together and himself sane. Other highlights of the show include Will Arnett as GOB (George Oscar Bluth II), Michael's lame-excuse-for-a-magician brother; Jeffrey Tambor as George Sr., Michael's incarcerated father (he was jailed for ""shifty accounting practices""); and Michael Cera as George Michael Bluth, Michael Bluth's perpetually nervous 13-year-old son (who just happens to have a strange infatuation with his cousin, Maebe, played by ""State of Grace""'s Alia Shawkat). All in all this show is sure to be a hit, at least with those people whose level of understanding of comedy is above slapstick and bathroom jokes. TREMENDOUSLY hilarious writing and outstanding performances by the whole cast will have you laughing the whole time. Ten out of ten!"
tt0367279,Season 4-5 were not necessary and kinda ruined it. The show was ahead of it's time it its is perfect for streaming. Seasons 1 to 3 is the funniest show of all time.
tt0367279,"You've doubtless heard fans rave and rave about this show, and may have even checked it out. The camp is sharply divided, people either absolutely love it, or tend to just ""not get it."" In that sense it may not be for everyone (great television, and great art in general, rarely is), and to each his own. But after watching each season multiple times, I can easily say that it is the funniest show that I have ever seen by an ENORMOUS margin. Even after many repeat viewings, I still end up in tears all the time.DVD treats this series well simply because it suits itself to rapid digestion (and after getting hooked, you won't be able to get up). The writers include many, many running gags that persist through entire seasons, or even the entire series (""I've made a huge mistake."" ""Her?""). The entire cast is extremely WELL cast and everyone's comedic timing is spot on. The real stars are David Cross as Tobias, and Will Arnett as GOB. Their physical comedy is drop dead hilarious as well. But Jessica Walters and Jeffrey Tambor are phenomenal, the former most especially in the third season.As others have stated there is no laugh track and this is part of what throws some of the ""we don't get it"" camp off. The humor is very fast paced as well, and many of the biggest laughs are very subtle physical comedy, or a line of dialog that is dropped in the midst of a conversation. Some of the music that was written for the show is absolutely hilarious as well, especially the song that plays often when George Micheal is put in an awkward (sexual) situation (""whatcha trying to say to me??"").Start with season 1, give it 4 episodes (go through at least the episode ""key decisions"" which I believe is ep 4). If you're not hooked, or at least intrigued by then, its likely you wont be at all. But if you're like me, and MANY others, you'll find that you've just stumbled upon one of the greatest shows ever made. VERY highly recommended. 10/10"
tt0367279,"The main score is excluding the last 2 seasons. Judging by the first 3 seasons, this is one of the best sitcoms ever made but various factors led to it not doing so well while it ran and getting cut. It became a lot more popular after it had ended and word of mouth got around about how great it was. Due to popular demand and the show being cut so soon, there were rumors about it being revived for years but unfortunately that didn't happen until Netflix decided to pick it up about 7 years after the last season.I don't know what happened with season 4, but the end result was a season with some big issues and lacking the clever comedy of the first 3 seasons. Season 5 was released nearly 5 years later that unfortunately was also very disappointing. I suspect a key person or people were not involved in season 4 and 5 (like Larry David was not involved in the last few seasons of Seinfeld, though the drop in quality wasn't as severe) or Netflix people butted in too much thinking they knew better.Again, the first 3 seasons are excellent and up there with other top sitcoms. Several of those sitcoms also had disappointing seasons towards the end, just most had made it at least 5 seasons before the quality started to decline. Arrested Development most likely would have been similar had Fox not canceled it after season 3."
tt0367279,"I'm excluding those seasons because I barley watched season 4 as it was unbearable, and I didn't even attempt to watch season 5. To me, Arrested Development is 3 incredible seasons of inventive, clever, witty television. This show was so funny. I loved the use of narration, visual gags, running gags, and how they contributed to the storytelling. It was always very well written, and the cast was amazing. They all bought something very distinct to their characters. I particularly liked Gob and Tobias the most, and Will Arnett and David Cross were both brilliant respectively. Loved this show, and it's a shame what it's slowly turned into."
tt0367279,Season 1-3 is good and funny but Season 4 & 5 is atrocious.
tt0367279,"I have seen a lot of great shows and a few bad ones. Arrested Development is brilliant, at least in my view. The show is well made visually, with very nice photography and sets that don't look cheap in any way. The music is memorable, particularly the theme tune, the story lines are well-structured with any big themes executed cleverly and the writing and jokes are some of the funniest and smartest I've seen. The characters are admittedly strange, but they are also unique and have their likability too, while the acting from the whole cast is consistently top-notch and the show even uses their guest stars in a creative way. All in all, funny, smart and engaging, quite simply a brilliant show. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0367279,"Watching the first five episodes of Arrested Development Season 5 is like individually cutting off all five of my left fingers, with time in-between to contemplate just why I was exactly doing this, only to be told that just one more finger will make me finally see the true meaning of this activity.I'm starting to feel like some fans are in serious denial. If seeing Jason Bateman on the screen is enough to make you forget about how terrible what you're watching is, then you're going to love this season. If not, I'd just stay away."
tt0367279,Great show till Netflix started making the show. Really enjoyed the first couple seasons and then Netflix took over and trashed it.
tt0367279,"Strange, Fox's promos almost made me miss out on this whole thing.It's a sit-com made with very high standards, it's a career revival for Ron Howard, Henry Winkler and Liza Minelli, and it's a show that puts Fox's profile into HBO territory. ""It's Arrested Development""""In fact..."", a Ron Howard quote that has become a cliché around our house, in fact, it's all those things and more. The writing is as good as everyone says it is, the cast is on par with that of Seinfeld or Roseanne. (Say what you will about her, that was a dream cast) Whenever new characters appear, they are inevitably played by people familiar to fans of edgy, intelligent humor. People like Jeffrey Tambor and Jason Bateman are dependably good, Michael Cera is a standout, and David Cross is finally being seen for the talent that he is. The strongest thing I can say about this is that I find myself repeating various running gags, things that, like ""In fact..."", have become clichés. ""I've made a huge mistake."" ""I'm having the time of my LIFE in here!"" ""surprisingly cat-like"" ""Take a powder, willya fellas?""This last one, uttered by Liza Minelli as Lucille Austero, sticks with me especially, and I hope that Liza stays with the show longer. As good as the principles are, she manages to outclass even them. The same with Henry Winkler, whose Barry Zuckercorn is the sort of lawyer television's been dying for. Among those main players, Lindsay and Tobias are pretty strange characters to begin with, but when you consider that they are an old married couple, that crosses the line into the bizarre. This show is full of people and situations you just won't see anywhere else, at least until other derivative shows start appearing.Watch carefully, as there are many bit and pieces lingering in the background that you might miss. Recently, George Michael was dumped by his girlfriend. As he trudged home in a state of misery, you could hear sad Charlie Brown music. In the background, you could see a real - but bright red - dog house, with a real dog lying on top of it. It's things like these that tell me that the creators are just pleased to be doing this show for it's own sake, and that kind of love of the work shows through in the end.Who knows if this show will last? There's an audience out there for this sort of thing, but they've generally settled into the Sunday night HBO schedule. Hopefully the Emmys, the word of mouth, and the critical raves will draw attention to this show. If not, we'll just have our A.D. dvds to keep us warm, and thank God for 'em!"
tt0367279,"Season 1: 8/10
Season 2: 10/10
Season 3: 9/10I don't recognize the rest."
tt0367279,"There was a time during what is commonly known as The Golden Age of Television when the medium was used to communicate. It was used to entertain, inspire, and evoke a connection with the people. There was time in television when the programs would challenge not only the standard, but also the viewer. It started with things like Sanford & Son and All In the Family. Then the Richard Pryor Show shook people to the bone. From these gems came further explorations of the comic genre. We were treated to things like The Simpsons, Married With Children, and Seinfeld. Shows that broke the mold of the typical sitcom formula. They found their actors and made them stars. They didn't take washed up has-been film actors and try to turn them into the affable characters that they obviously were not. They simply took fresh talent and gave them the environment to get better and eventually captivate. Then something terrible happened in 1993. A show, on what was supposed to be a music video network, got the idea to film real people living together in a house. From the first episode of The Real World, the Golden Age of Television was over. From this little show spawned a countless number of reality TV Shows that have paved the way for mind numbing experiences of watching people acting ""real"" while they are being filmed. It showed us all that not only is this medium of television completely unoriginal, but that it also provided people with insight into just how far somebody will go to get themselves on the airwaves. In 1994 something else happened. A little show called ""Friends"" hit the desk of the execs at NBC. From that we now have an endless string of formulaic, hokey, poorly written buddy sitcoms, all focusing on the same issues that plague the ""poor"" yuppie world that these people all seem to inhabit. Gone was the time when you didn't really need the laugh track; gone was the time of multi-plot line programming.And then, something truly amazing and inspiring happened. In a collaborative effort from the Hurwitz Company and Imagine Entertainment came a brilliant piece of intelligent programming; a show that had no precedent. A truly talented ensemble cast, a brilliant writing team, and an amazing staff of directors and photographers that changed the art form like never before. Gone were the days of traditional, canned laughter sitcoms. It seems that we had all been saved from another infinite line of weak programs, and by whom? The FOX Network. Who would have thunk it? But then again, it made perfect sense. FOX brought us The Simpsons, Married With Children, and Family Guy. They had been known to challenge the bar that was set by regular programming. But instead of living on with those classics, it was forced to willow away in the doldrums of cancellation alongside other brilliant yet failed shows, like Action, Titus, and Greg the Bunny. Some people like to watch clichéd, overplayed, over done formulas every week. Some people like the safe humor, the one-two camera angles, the boring sets, and the canned laughter. Some people just don't want to think. The rest of usthe rest of us watch Arrested Development."
tt0367279,"I've seen a lot of basic comedy-shows and AV came as my epiphany.Two things are making this show so perfect:
1) The character design...
It's as simple as amazing. None of them seems to change at all but that's fine. Although they are all facing kinda the same situations again and again, it never gets boring. Michael, his son, Tobias and George Bluth are my favorites.2) The situations that are being created...
Whether it's throughout the whole show or just a single episode of it - person A, B, and C are all dealing with their own hilarious stuff and somehow they end up in a single storyline. At that point, I don't even wanna know how it happened, yet my amusement level is at the top.Not gonna watch S4 and 5 though. I had a blast with this so far and im satisfied with how it ended."
tt0367279,"10 stars belong to the Fox network run of the series. I still remember watching the debut season on Sunday evenings. The netflix reboot was just.........wrong and I knocked off 2 stars because it feels little more than a knock off than an actual continuation of the show. The reboot feels like there's 2/3rds less comedy in each episode compared to the shows in the first 3 seasons. Also, it does a really lousy job trying to pick things up years down the line. More clumsy than offbeat funny. They really could have done better. Maybe it tries too hard but its years too late, maybe it forgot the show had likable characters, maybe it was too busy trying to be a political allegory instead of being funny like, a sitcom. I guess it's true what they say about any art. You can't go back and pretend it's the same. Then again, there's a few netflix reboots that failed miserably after moving to that streaming service (Designated Survivor anyone??].So the show has the appearance of a reality tv show/mockumentary about a rich family who ends up broke and mired in legal troubles. In the orginal run, it focused on the middle son of the family trying to keep the family and business going despite his desperation to abandon them. The show throws alot of comedic curves and stays fresh for awhile as things get more outlandish. I rank the oringal 53 episode run up there with Fawlty Towers considering the amount of jokes and gags stuffed into a single episode. It is incredible how much they got into one 23 minute episode. Its like a joke every 7 seconds and yet they still develop a story in that. Those first 3 seasons are the fastest feeling and most enjoyable binge watching experience of all time.Arrested Development had a very strong cult following (sadly lousy ratings) hence its demand for a reboot but honestly the first 3 seasons are a perfect bookend. It ends where it begins under similar circumstances but with opposite resolutions. One can only do so much for people who only think of themselves but are still somehow incapable of helping themselves. That was the lesson learned and leaving it there was right.If you only know the series from its initial 3 season 53 episode run but never got around to the 4th and 5th season netflix run, you aren't missing anything. They're forgettable. The reboot is like those Gilligan's Island movies after that show ended or the Revenge of the Nerds movies that never made it to theaters. The fast paced humor is gone, the story is a mess, the premise restated during the opening credits is abandoned and instead of the narration helping fuel comedy, it turns into boring exposition most of the time. Like the plot and existence of the characters alone is meant to be the joke and the show was always about black comedy which it never was (more of a screwball comedy than anything else). I question if anyone involved in the reboot really wanted to do it for more than just money."
tt0367279,"*Note: My review refers ONLY to the original series (seasons 1-3).What can I say ? This is a flawless and brilliant character-based gem of a comedy. The show's premise (how rich people would cope if they lost all their money) is ground for massive potential, and the show's creators do not disappoint. This show is also in a sense prophetic as it cleverly anticipated the boom of reality-TV, being shot in brilliantly amateurish fashion. The story revolves around the super-wealthy Bluth family, rendered penniless after the patriarch is jailed for embezzlement. The one 'normal' son, Michael, tries to salvage his eccentric family as they get into blunder after blunder. This includes his elder brother Gob (a 'magician'), younger brother Buster (an 'academic'), twin sister Lindsay (an 'activist'), brother in law Tobias (an 'actor'), niece Maeby (a slacker), mother Lucille (sharp-tongued socialite) and son George Michael (an innocent). The show is brilliant on so many levels, and the writing is incredibly smart. The show is highly quotable, and throughout its original 3 series never lost momentum. The beauty of this show is definitely the delusional characters. They all clearly suffer from a delusion of still being rich, and each character has a particular quirk. Even the supporting characters are brilliant (nods to Liza Minelli as Lucille Ostero, Henry Winkler as Barry Zuckercorn, Julia- Louis Dreyfuss as Maggie Lieser, and Ben Stiller as Tony Wonder). Brilliant brilliant show, but I advise against watching Netflix's 2013 4th season. The 2003-6 run was epic."
tt0367279,"If you were allowed to pick only one show for your post-pandemic life, this would be the one."
tt0367279,"It was really really great show, but then came the Netflix and ruined it."
tt0367279,"This is, without a doubt, the greatest TV comedy in capturing the 2000s. It mocks the paranoia surrounding the Iraq War, the 24-hour news cycle, the housing boom and bust, and the cult of reality television without missing a beat.It does all of that without ever seeming preachy or losing its charming sense of humor. There is no scene in the series that lacks the self- referential humor that characterizes the show, and almost every episode builds on the quirks of either one of the main characters or one of the many background characters of Orange County. Jason Bateman (Michael) does a solid job, but the real stars are the other members of the family. Michael Cera (George Michael), David Cross (Tobias Fünke), and Jessica Walter (Lucille) are particularly memorable.I will never look at a seal, model homes, or Southern California itself without thinking about the wonderfully dysfunctional Bluths and the time that I spent watching them on ""Arrested Development.""(I have seen this show several times over the years, but I have mostly recently watched in its entirety in June 2017)"
tt0367279,10 for the first three seasons but 4 for the last two! Id recommend watching the first three and nothing more. But for the first three MY GOD peak of sitcom comedy one of the smartest and funniest shows out there.
tt0367279,What is the deal with season 5? Are George Michael and Maeby supposed to still be teenagers? Why do they call the model home George Michael's childhood home? I knew it was over when GM punched his dad. Another great show has been ruined.
tt0459724,"This miniseries is epically profound! Ostensibly about immigrants to, and from, Argentina (which makes this move a must-see for anyone interested in, or planning to visit, Argentina), but in fact it is one of the most insightful looks into the drama of the human condition.I am 60 years old, and lived an adventurous life. It takes a lot to impress me... yet this series affected me profoundly! I can honestly say that watching this series was far more productive and meaningful than months of therapy. It quite literally changed my life! This is a very unknown series because it was aired on Public TV (Instituto Nacional de Cine y Artes Audiovisuales), and they kept changing the times and put it on at very odd times, and never reran it. Even in Argentina is is barely known of.Juan Campanella is best known (internationally) for directing ""El secreto de sus ojos"" (2009), for which he won Best Foreign Film. It was a brilliant film, but this, IMHO, surpasses that movie! Especially in light of the fact that Campanella was also the creator and writer (p.s. other directed and wrote some episodes as well, so credit to them)"
tt0459724,"This series is great!!! I love it! it's highly recommended. Don't judge it for its first episode, if you see at least 3 and you don't like thats OK, but don't don't judge for the first one 'cos it kinda boring, but then it gets better and better, and you want to keep watching and you think ""why there are only 13 episodeees?!?! Please Campanella!! make more!!!"" There is a parallelism of a Spaniard that had to emigrate to Argentina because of the war, and on 2001 his son has to emigrate to Spain because of financial issues, what it is cool about this show is that this two stories are shown simultaneously, the inside stories are very good too. Just Great"
tt0459724,"Vientos de Agua talks about emigration, a frequently history on our diary life. Who is not happy to told, but is necessary. It represents the past, present and future of the people.Emigration is the idea over the history, who talk about relationships (of love, father-son, between different cultures...) about politic (anarchism, totalitarism...), the change of the way of live... Vientos de Agua spokes about life, in all of it sense.All the actors rise an excellent level, one to one, no exceptions... Well, unless Hector Alterio; he rises more than perfect, his expresions, the look, the movement, he have the humanity in his soul.Concluding, for me, is the best series i have never seen in my life; because when a history need to be told... it is shown with all the feeling."
tt0459724,"What can I say about ""Vientos de Agua""? It's simply the most amazing and enjoyable TV series I've ever seen. The selected cast fits very well with the story, which is very interesting and catches you from the very beginning. The art direction and the photography are really awesome. Both creates wonderful atmospheres while the tale goes by. Another interesting point view is the music, that is very powerful and contributes to feel the story. Juan José Campanella deserves my great admiration. I've seen all his previous movies and arrived to a conclusion: he is the only one that can touch my heart with his nice and peculiar way of telling moving tales."
tt0459724,"This is probably one of the best series I have ever watched. It is deep, human, complex... it is life, with its highs and lows written and played beautifully. The main story is about immigration, but the deeper story, its about the complexities of life and love... and about the fact that nobody is 100% good or bad... . Acting is spectacular, production quality is great, dialogues are smart, passionate, deep and the story is crafted masterfully. Do not miss it. Its on Netflix."
tt0459724,"Thank you, Campanella, for this awesome story! Incredible actors, and so well done!"
tt0459724,"Campanella's masterpiece, a great story, which happens to have a lot in common with my father's, who left Asturias in 1925 to avoid the draft and landed in Argentina. My dad also lived in a Jewish neighborhood in Buenos Aires, where I was born later. Just like Andres, he was an Anarchist who became a Peronist, as did most of his union friends. And he was fortunate to return to Asturias before his death. He kept a lot of secrets about his life, something I respect. The life of emigrants is faithfully described in this saga. Interlaced with some of the most relevant events in Spain and Argentina during the twentieth century. Great cast, wonderful music, a must see..."
tt0459724,Don't judge before you've watched at least 3 episodes. Totaly worth it. Slightly reminds to Cinema Paradiso. Emotive and intense. Definitely a masterpiece.
tt0459724,I'm watching this for the second time because I enjoyed it so much the first and I'm liking it even better because I understand more of the dialogue and it's easier to follow knowing the plot already. But on the second viewing I can see even more the brilliant story writing and the weaving of the two tales. I would rank it in my top ten list of TV series. My only criticism is I've never seen such unattractive goofy guys get so many beautiful women!
tt0459724,"The story, the history, the birth of Argentine culture, the demise of Argentine culture, the immigration experience, the acting, the amazing actors, the cinematography, the phenomenal writing, the evolving accents, it's a true masterpiece. I agree, someone said it reminded them of cinema paradiso.I cried, I laughed, I learned..."
tt0459724,"This must be the masterpiece in the career of Juan Jose Campanella. A superb historical drama of Spanish emigration to Argentina intertwined with the journey back to the motherland of an Argentine facing the effects of the 2001 economic crash leaving his family and trying to make it work in Spain - which is what a lot of Latin Americans did.I watched this series on Netflix in Peru, I don't think I would have caught it otherwise if I had been in the UK but I am glad I did and devoured it over three or four days. There are thirteen episodes and each one is lovingly crafted and directed and brilliantly acted and when I read later that the show wasn't a massive success in Spain, it surprised me somewhat - I don't know how that wasn't a massive success but there we have it - the choices people make.As an emigrant to far away lands myself, I saw a lot of myself in both of the main characters and the journey comes full circle for both of them as it does for me, the viewer, this is a wonderful series, well worth your time in watching it to the end. Brilliant, one of the best things I have ever seen."
tt0459724,"The first objection is, as in most series there is a lot of repetition and redundancy and the action slows down considerably at times. The second: the tale sometimes meanders along subsidiary and contrived plots that don't add much to the whole such as those involving Marta Etura and Angie Cepeda, both excellent actresses whose talents are not fully used. Some characters (such as Andrés' sister and Vidal's son) are built of clichés and take up screen time for no good reason. And, some episodes are confusing and clumsily narrated.There are positives, however. The plot evolves in two time frames in Spain and Argentina and the reconstruction of time and place is flawless in each case. Example: the cars shown in Buenos Aires of the thirties and forties have the wheel on the right side; driving in Argentina was on the left side of the road until 1945.Good acting from the principals Héctor and Ernesto Alterio and Eduardo Blanco, although the latter is miscast. The rest of the actors do well with special mention for Pablo Rago, who hits all the right notes all the time. The script has flashes of brilliancy. One is the depiction of the relationship between Andrés, Juliusz and the young Gemma in an intensely moving way but without excess sentimentality. Among many other examples is a short speech by a cabinetmaking worker where he explains with striking clarity why he supports Colonel Perón, a populist leader that would become President of Argentina in 1946.The final evaluation of the series is: somewhat unsatisfactory. It is frequently rambling and unfocused, at times confusing, contains unnecessary subplots and characters and is way too long for its subject matter.Viento de Agua (in local spelling Viento d'Agua) is a small town in Asturias at the bottom of one of the typical rías (vast indentations of the coast caused by ancient flooding of river valleys). Vientos de agua means ""winds announcing rain."""
tt0459724,Barely made it through the first episode. Very slow and dull. The constant switching between time periods doesn't work.
tt0459724,"Excellent cast but very disappointed. The series is based on communist ideas, defending and accepting murders like Fidel Castro and Ernesto Guevara. A tremendous waste of time."
tt0434706,"This is not typical anime, it is not even a series or a video, it is an experience I have gone through watching this piece of brilliance called Monster.I have been a huge fan of crime dramas of Martin Scorcese and thrillers of Alfred Hitchcock and totally enjoy movies that dive deep into human emotions such as 7even, Taxi Driver, V for Vendetta, Machinist, Schindler's List, American Beauty etc. For anyone out there with similar tastes, this is a must watch content. It is must watch because all those works that we have seen until now seem so little in terms of their emotional intensity before this masterpiece of a thriller.Unlike the title, there are no monsters in this series, well actually there is one, far more deadlier than the ones in our nightmares, monster created as a result of difference in the perception of what we see in society. No, we are not talking about psychopaths with extreme emotions that enjoy hurting people here, but normal human being that can see the difference between good and bad, light and darkness, life and death very clearly and thus obviously does not agree with the society. The whole series is about a monster created out of the extreme surroundings around him and the people he encounters during his life that either get obsessed with his thinking or want to kill him for how dangerous he is.Overall this series could be the best animated work as it would leave you with an everlasting feeling like it did on me. There has been an attempt to make a movie out of the plot and nothing seems to be happening, I wish it stayed that way. A story like this will be a disaster as a 2-3 hour movie, there is just too much good stuff in here that cannot be passed/cut-down to make a movie.For those who watched V for Vendetta, this work will seem relevant to the main theme of series. Be ready to spend some time (74 episodes) and make sure you do not give more than 1 day break between each episode as you could forget everything very fast. You should concentrate on everything in the episode as there are hundreds of characters that have a lot to do with the plot."
tt0434706,Monster is an incredibly satisfying watch and rewards paying attention to smaller details. The story is intricately woven to make even the smallest advancements seem well worth it. The characters are all very well written and they all have a very distinct role in the story. Tension is built perfectly and the realm of safety doesn't apply to any of the characters. Monster successfully crafts one of the most engaging stories of all time and is one of my favorite anime of all time.
tt0434706,"I've watched a lot of anime, I've read a lot of manga, but Monster has managed to blow all of my former ""favorites"" out of the water. It manages to combine everything that's great about thrillers, mysteries, character studies, and psychological dramas all at once. The writing is superior, the direction is fantastic, and the way the story builds is slow but undoubtedly engaging. If Alfred Hitchcock had ever endeavored to create a serial work, it would be something like this.The characters are all lovingly and soulfully rendered, and the show never seems to fall into the traps that even the best anime do - that is: needless fanservice, forced comedy, or ludicrous violence.In addition, get ready for a history lesson. This story deals more with the social and political annals of 20th century Eastern Europe - ACCURATELY - than most classes on the subject."
tt0434706,"I was always a bit negative about anime because of the childish, almost cringy ways of delivering stories that have the potential of being really good.And that's when I came across Monster. The first episode immediately got me scared and hooked at the same time, and it wasn't necessarily the episode itself that got me. It was the credits. The image I saw, the music that played gave me an indescribable feeling of terror, loneliness... and great anticipation.So I continued watching. Every episode was even better than the last. The story was extremely engaging. I had strong emotions about every character, whether it was love, hatred, disgust or fear. The tension was constantly there, and it was great to see the mysteries unfold. What was so great about it is that the mysteries don't stay mysteries for too long, I always found that when unanswered questions drag on for too long, I lose my interest to even find out the answers (I'm looking at you, BBC Sherlock and the Kingdom Hearts Saga), but this show really got me going.The small backstories were also a lot of fun, I've told people various small tales that come from this show and I always manage to pique their interest. And I'm not even a good storyteller, that's just how amazing the concept of each backstory is!Well, I think I've said plenty. If the animation quality/style is what throws you off, which I can kind of understand, please do keep watching anyway. It's really, really worth it."
tt0434706,"I've seen a lot of Animes and I have to say this is the best one in my opinion, a true masterpiece that goes beyond others. I liked Monster since its not a common Anime (japanese cartoon) since it doesn't evolve around supernatural abilities or Futeristic techs. The story is written in a way that make it feel very realistic. The realistic story also makes it a very scary story in a sense that the monsters in this story actually can exists, these are the real monsters we should be scared of.Don't let the fact that its anime scare you off. Even if its hard to watch at first you'll get used to it, the story makes up for it. The story is so compelling that once you get into it it's hard to stop watching. I don't want to spoil any of plot more than it questions a common moral ""all human life is equal worth"". The plot really gets you thinking."
tt0434706,"Once I started reading this manga, I really couldn't stop. It's probably one of the most fascinating, complex and suspenseful stories I've ever read. The artist's grasp of facial expression is amazing. When I compare Monster to other manga I've read...well, for the most part, there is no comparison. Like another commenter said, there is no fanservice, no glorification of violence, pointless gags, characters with cutesy personality quirks, etc...everything seems genuine and real. There were moments that horrified me speechless and scenes that brought tears to my eyes, too. Monster is very moving, but also very disturbing...a powerful commentary on human nature."
tt0434706,"I can't take the sadness why this anime ever ended?! I remember I felt deep emptiness when I finished it for the first time. As expected from Madhouse, Monster was a monster creation. Monster is my first work which I got to know of Naoki Urasawa. Monster is literally one of the best anime ever made."
tt0434706,"People traditionally associate Japanese animes with the likes of Pokemon and Dragonball Z and it is often very difficult to convince non-anime fans that there's more to them. I'm no exception! Luckily, Monster was the third serial anime I was introduced to after Death Note and Fruits Basket (odd combos, I know). And to be honest, I was not expecting this.The series starts off ordinarily with the traditional story of a doctor forced to prioritize between patients and his career. The story of two traumatized children is introduced along the way and things start becoming rather interesting. By the time I got to this point, I had completely forgotten I was watching an anime. See, in traditional Japanese animes (and no disrespect to the fans), the writers have no idea how to develop the dialogue and make it work with the story. The height of a character's shock will be repeating somebody's name in a low, gaspy/raspy voice. Among the millions of other queer things, I never got why anime writers felt that was a good emotional expression. I simply dismissed it as another odd Japanese behavior.As a pleasant surprise, Monster does almost everything to stray from that. At so many points during the story, I wondered how brilliant this would've been as a non-animated series. The character development is interesting and not muggled up or confusing, the songs/music make sense for a change, there are no irritating characters trying to be funny and the plot keeps thickening ... although slowly, and that might be a flaw. But to be honest, the gradual development is what keeps you so attached to it.So in conclusion, if you're a japanime fan and want to introduce the haters to the club, I highly recommend you make them watch this as their first ever anime. All in all, a 9.5/10 score. Definitely worth the watch!"
tt0434706,"I recently watched the popular anime serial Death Note. In search for a similar dark and gritty tale of power and deceit, I stumbled upon this little pearl. Like Death Note it's an epic train ride of plot twists and philosophical visions on the worth of human life. It is about the young surgeon Dr. Tenma who finds himself in an awkward situation. Will he continue the operation on a little boy with a gun wound in the head, or will he save the mayor of the city, and also benefactor of his hospital, from the effects of a stroke? In all his fairness he makes the choice to save the boy. It is the beginning of a tremendous tragedy; his boss and father-in-law doesn't want him anymore, his wife dumps him, colleagues despise him, and he becomes the scapegoat for the hospital. And then something odd happens. The little boy and his twin sister disappear and all the people who meant to do harm are killed. Though everything points at Dr Tenma's direction, there is not enough evidence for prosecution. And from that point on starts the story of Dr Tenma's quest to find out what happened and who was behind the killings. He stumbles upon a terrifying discovery that will alter his life tremendously.I like this cleverly written show for its addictive storyline and emotionally tense scenes. You must be willing to accept the many ''fillers'' - episodes with as only goal to lengthen the story - but it's well worth too watch through them. Those of you who liked Death Note, please give this less famous show a try. In some ways I think Monster even surpasses Death Note by its themes and dark vision on humanity."
tt0434706,"Monster is mostly about the story and it sticks to each and every detail even the dialogs from its adoption of manga. The Plot and Script is so good it would be a bestseller in any format be it a book or a movie.While being a Japanese animation it differs from other works by being realistic. The characters, props , situation , location, the time period all makes it seem it can happen in real life. Nothing is over the top, no super powers or magic involved.The way story evolves and concludes is mind boggling. Most of the episodes leaves you in a cliff hanger making you want to watch one more so you know whats going to happen. The story never tries to push itself so at time it gets slow. But each arc builds itself up for great conclusion.Another great thing in this series are the characters and you will feel for them. They all are unique having there flaws making them real.Many people have a aversion for animation this one will break that as its not aimed for anime fans but for general public who enjoy crime/physiological/detective thrillers."
tt0434706,"I find animes with philosphical/moral questioning and thought provoking narratives take a backseat too many times to these cringy high school ""sexy"" animes or fighting animes like Naruto. This anime is phenomenal, has great development, characters, plot-twists, etc... Yes, it's a bit long but I binged this anime and I don't regret it, still in my top 3 of all time."
tt0434706,"""The Never-Ending Journey"" (Name of Episode 56)I am not a hardcore anime fan, but I enjoy watching a ""good"" anime from time to time. Whatever ""good"" means, because monster is universally praised. I was very disappointed after watching it and regretted all the time I invested in this anime. My mistake, I trusted the hype and thought it must be worth it to ""sit through"".I just want to warn others about what to expect from this anime and I suggest to think twice before investing 1850 minutes / 30 hours of your life.The main problem with this show is that it is much (much) too long. I have no problem with long series, if the length is justified. I don't want to miss a single episode of Breaking Bad for example. The story of monster is not grand enough to fill 30 hours. Many (many) episodes will deal with uninteresting side stories and information about certain characters, which a) are not very interesting and b) are not relevant for the plot at all. Be ready to witness (repeated) childhood memories, shopping sprees (!) and our hero Dr. Tenma treating all kind of random people (broken leg here, gunshot there). You might hit the skip button for the first 3 - 4 minutes of each episode, because it will mostly just repeat the ending of the previous episode. A quick calculation reveals that the show has around 5 hours of repeated flashbacks. 5 hours equals a 12 episode season. Things would not be half as bad if all the information, the characters would play a significant role in the plot and especially in the end. But most of the characters seem to have the single purpose to simulate an epic scale of the story and Monster fails miserably to deliver on that note. After finishing the series I looked back and wondered, why was all that exposition needed, if so many questions were left unanswered. The only reason we get to know so much about certain characters is to fill 74 episodes. That is all. Be aware that many if not most of the plot details, which look interesting on first sight, will not be explained in full. Don't expect ""monster"" to make much sense in the end. Which leads to the next main problem:Ridden with annoying plot devices. To fill 74 episodes of this crime story the writers needed to make use of McGuffins and Deus Ex Machina plot devices to move the plot along. Suspension of disbelieve is required throughout the series. Coincidences play a big role in everything that happens. In the universe of monster it is completely natural that anybody you encounter will most likely be connected to the plot. It seems that everybody is a relative or a friend of a key character. The twists and turns become a boring routine.Monster was a huge and very long disappointment. And if you start watching and start feeling slightly bored around episode 20, do yourself a favor and stop, because it will get worse. You might end up like me: After watching 35 episodes you might feel obliged to ""finish"" it, just like a job you need to do.I think there was potential in the plot and without all the crap it could have been a solid crime story. The scenery was great and authentic and there were some interesting ideas and concepts in series. But most of the good aspects are buried under a huge pile of boring and unnecessary episodes. I assume there is a solid crime story hidden somewhere in the 74 episodes. But we will never know.Maybe this show was made for kids who don't bother as much as I do or maybe i don't appreciate anime as much as I thought. I don't remember having such problems with Neon Genesis Evangelion, Elfen Lied or Haibane Renmei though.The true mystery of Monster is why it is getting so much praise. ""Monster"" is just bad. True Detective tells a griping and epic crime story in 8 hours. Better watch it twice instead of Monster."
tt0434706,"This series held surprises into the very last episode.I'm not really going to include any major spoilers for the series in my review. The closest that I'll come will cover what you've probably heard about from any general discussion concerning the TV series, or the books that the story comes from, or the opening TV credits for the very first episode. That means that some key elements from the first 4 episodes, which covers the first 5% of the 74 episode series, will be mentioned. But it's hard to even say what the series is about without going that far, and you're likely to get more spoilers in any major review of the latest Hollywood mega-release anyways.In life, there are two types of monsters. The first is the type that most of us have probably thought of in our childhood, the type that we feared under the bed or in the closet, the type who our parents or guardians told us didn't exist. The second type, however, is what the title of this series refers to. This is the type which adults do fear, the type that does exist. This monster can plan human deaths with the same nonchalance that others have when they decide the details of getting their next coffee.Naoki Urasawa's story is one that covers such a monster, but this monster isn't the main character. Instead, the main character is the highly skilled Japanese neurosurgeon Kenzou Tenma, working in Germany shortly after its reunification. Tenma believes that all life is of equal high worth, and that the value of life isn't changed with wealth, fame, nor with celebrity status. But he discovers that the hospital itself doesn't share that belief. The life that he saved, the life which more desperately needed his skills, looked so much like another anonymous life that was about to get wiped out by the hospital's lack of ethics. But Tenma unknowingly gave life back to a monster. And for the first time ever, Tenma regrets the life that he saved; so much so that he finds himself forced to correct that mistake.From this point, if you saw the opening credits which cover the first 90 seconds of the very first episode, you can guess the general direction of the series. Picture the TV series 'The Fugitive', but with a single storyline which went from the first episode to the last. Now throw in a detective (Inspector Runge) who is as calm, confident, and calculating as the devil himself, pursuing Tenma. There are also other characters in the series, who are crucial to how the story builds, and who are rather difficult to introduce clearly without spoiling some of the many subplots which build through the series. These characters include Tenma's ex-fiancée Eva, as well as a retired detective, a reclusive billionaire, two criminal psychiatrists, members of organized crime, ones involved in possible illegal dealings with the Czech police, a crusading defense attorney, and others.There will be a few times where the main storyline seems to be put on hold, and a new storyline with new characters will be introduced. And you'd likely be wondering why things have taken a detour, or when they'll get back to the actual story. But the overall plot is much more complex and detailed than you may have seen on other serial thrillers such as 'Alias', '24', or 'Lost'. The seemingly disjointed story lines in 'Monster' slowly build to be a critical part in the overall plot, and the series overall doesn't have any wasted scenes or episodes (filler), nor the jumps and jolts which betray signs of last minute rewrites.If you're hoping that the upcoming Hollywood movie based on the series will be as good, you might want to reconsider. For starters, it'll mean rewriting a story which takes 37 broadcast hours to tell, and re-conveying that over a time slot of 90 to 100 minutes. Also, it'll be coming from the same talent pool which took the highly rated Japanese movies 'Ringu', 'Ju-On', and 'Shall We Dance', and turned them into the mediocre Hollywood productions 'The Ring', 'The Grudge', and 'Shall We Dance'. (From 94-64-79 to 72-40-49, according to RottenTomatoes.com.) While Hollywood can make a good original movie occasionally, their record at remaking movies leaves a lot to be desired.In short, this is one of the better suspense stories out there. The writing is solid, the characters are believable (even when their character changes), and the story always makes sense. In some story arcs, just when you think they're getting ready to wrap things up, they find a way to ratchet up the tension again. But it never seems forced, or cheap, like what is by far more common in most thrillers I've seen. 'Monster' is definitely a series which requires your full attention when watching it, due to the pace which events happen and the number of details which all come together as the story progresses. And if you don't mind a long story with a lot of twists and turns, this is definitely one worth following."
tt0434706,"Not going to go into detail like the other reviews since not many that hasn't watched the show reads them. Looking at the reviews in general, you'ld see that it's divided into 2 extremes. People that absolutely love it and people that don't appreciate good storytelling.The show is extremely slow but none of the episodes (well, maybe 3 were filler-like) were a waste of time. Anyone that thought 74 episodes had no plot progression doesn't understand the point of the journey.It's not a show for everyone, if you only seek andrenaline from action packed things or constant 'mind-games' like in death note, this probably isn't for you. If you only like things that give you 'the feels' or lovey-dovey romanctic films expecting a perfect ending, this isn't for you.
The operative words being 'only' and 'probably', not saying that everyone that watches those fall into the same catergory. (probably going to get backlash because many people only read what they like)There are minor plotholes or rather, things which are pretty unbelievable unless you have a pretty high suspension of disbelieve but if you look part those, it's a darn perfect thriller. That's about it."
tt0434706,"This is a very mature, serious and dark anime that has one of the best stories I have ever experienced. It has maybe the best character development I have ever seen in a work of entertainment. The story has great depth and is very detailed and the way it is portrayed is exceptional at allowing the viewer to understand and form their own judgement on each moment meaning there is no spoon feeding. It is a must watch!"
tt0434706,"Let's get this out of the way first: I REALLY liked Monster! But, I wouldn't watch it again...Monster is a down-to-Earth psychological crime drama. At first it might appear to have supernatural elements, but I won't spoil it for you. After watching the entire thing, I would say Monster would've been great as a live-action TV series, which couldn't be said for any other anime I watched so far (and I watched quite a lot). It has everything a great series needs, a cast of characters that the audience can care about, action-packed scenes to liven up the pretty in-depth crime drama, great character development, a good story full of twists and turn that will keep you coming back for more and an astonishing and realistic art-style to wrap it all together. During it's 74 episodes it brings up many hard questions about the human psyche, morality and human connections, relationships. How far are we willing to go to accomplish our goals? How much of your humanity are you willing to trade in for them? What is ""humanity"" anyway? Some of the episodes are frighteningly realistic in describing the human condition and it doesn't back down from touching really hard social and historical taboos either. No, it grabs you by the hair and slams your face in them saying ""Look! That's what you are!"". I can safely say Monster was one of the most unique and thought-provoking experiences I've ever had.But, (and yes, here comes the ""but"") Monster is anything but perfect. While it's action-packed and suspenseful story would stand great on it's own, it's sadly spread too thin and too long. The story needlessly drags on for 74 episodes and the ending feels more like a coup de grace than closure. The cast of main characters is huge, and while they are really well made and fleshed out, we are continuously introduced to a slew of new side-characters that have barely any relevance to the main story (if at all). The writers regularly go off on tangents just to demonstrate a small plot point or tidbits of (mostly irrelevant) character backstory, bringing in and taking out characters on a whim after they ""served their purpose"". In the end, they were seemingly just struggling to give enough individual screen-time to their monstrously bloated cast (pun intended), and it only makes the audience lose interest in them and lose count on who is who why they are even there.The story is mostly delivered in (sometimes painfully dragged out) exposition. The story lurches forward in needlessly detailed investigation sequences flooded with meaningless trivia and extra character backstory that have little to no bearing on the main story itself. The story regularly branches off into dead-ends and meaningless side-plots that fill entire episodes yet don't bring anything new or interesting to the table. The sheer amount of dialogue and narration in Monster would fill entire volumes of books. Even the exposition itself is riddled by double-takes, needlessly repeated ""remembering"" segments and a ton of redundant, rephrased information. You can seriously skip entire dozens of episodes and still understand everything since the characters and the exposition keep repeating themselves over and over. The whole series could've been distilled down to a neat 30-35 episodes without losing any of the story.My third (entirely personal) beef is with the setting. Unlike most anime, the entire story of Monster takes place in 80's and 90's Europe (mostly Germany and the former Czechoslovakia). See, I was born and still living in Europe, I lived in the time and place the show takes place. Monster being a work of fiction, I chalked up most of the factual, cultural and historical errors to ""writer's freedom"" and ""suspension of disbelief"" and such. While the creators of the anime obviously did their homework and got most of the big things right, there were some things that bugged me more than they should've. Little, insignificant things that most people from other parts of the world would miss, were just screaming at me from the screen. Getting used to the obviously Japanese mannerisms, phrases and behaviors forced upon the allegedly European characters is one thing. But small details like choice of words, type of foods/drinks, fashion, architecture or even music in some places were just flat our wrong and felt so out of place that it shoved me right out of the immersion. I know it sounds lame, but since the creators obviously tried to recreate the setting realistically, I just couldn't help it.I know I spent most of this review pandering on what's wrong with Monster, but the truth is, I really liked it, and I stand by my score of 8/10. It's really worth watching for everyone who desires something other than the run-of-mill anime, something unique. If you can overlook the droll exposition and sometimes aimlessly branching and dragged out storytelling, you'll find a really suspenseful and interesting story of crime and punishment, dark secrets, interesting characters, huge plot twists, thrilling psychological expeditions into the human mind and soul and much more."
tt0434706,"The only series that I have seen that I have enjoyed as much as this are Lost and Breaking Bad.I absolutely love this anime, it seems to touch on every single walk of life, both light and dark, it has made my cry on so many occasions, not necessarily out of sadness, but also because of the beauty in which it presents many parts of life.The only criticisms I would give is that the dialogue is not always worded in a realistic way, but this might be more to do with the translation from Japanese to English, and this was only a minor, minor problem to me.What I really like is that the main protagonist is so likable, and so many characters are met on his journey who are also likable and interesting.I also love the amount of travelling the characters do, which really gives the series a sense of adventure.I don't feel the pilot is a good representation of the whole show, so I would suggest watching at least 5 episodes before making a judgement, but even then it doesn't cover the scope of where this anime will take you."
tt0434706,"when i stumbled upon this anime i thought it's going to follow the stereotypes of a typical anime. well, it doesn't. don't be fooled by the title. it's a representation of life- as real as it gets.it's so unique that it doesn't even follow the stereotypes of mysteries and thrillers. it's engaging, suspenseful, horrifying but not in the way most of the films or books of this genre are. never seeking shelter in the shadow of gore or violence it takes the viewer to the darkest corners of inhumanity and poses a serious question- what is a monster and how little or how much does it take to turn a human being into one?before i watched this anime i thought joker is the most sadistic villain of all time. in wikipedia i read- the Trickster remarks, ""When super- villains want to scare each other, they tell Joker stories."" after watching this anime i have come to realize that the stories of the antagonist of this series will make the joker tremble and shiver in utter fear. that's what he is- the embodiment of fear, manipulation and sadistic. he along with all the characters of this anime are so real and so well developed that nothing will ever contradict or seem out of reality. the narrative is phenomenal. it's historically accurate, emotionally subtle yet engulfing, morally challenging and as a viewing experience greatly entertaining. another thing i must point out- the voice acting is the best i have seen in anime by far.the only thing that's off putting about this series is its finale primarily because it doesn't offer enough closure. but even if u crave for closures in general, after watching this anime u will have to agree- masterpieces like this are better left open to interpretations."
tt0434706,"For some reason people always compare this series with Death Note as which one is the best suspense thriller anime. I honestly can't get that since they are both very different, one has a notebook that can kill and death demons, and the other is about the demons in humanity. I loved both but Monster which I only heard about on a top 10 mystery thriller list on YouTube is 74 episodes long, and I enjoyed every minute of it. I fully believe this underrated gem is one of the best anime ever made along with Cowboy Bebop and Attack on Titan. So do yourself a favor and watch it."
tt0434706,"Unbelievably perfect. This complex and beautiful storyline unfolds over 74 incredible episodes, untangling the deepest philosophies and the loveliest intricacies of human life with every carefully constructed character and scene. I have never watched an epic of this magnitude. The composition, score, production, dialogue, and plot all work beautifully together. Even as the series dips deeply into the life of virtually every single character (and there are a multitude of impeccable and vital characters - more than a dozen), the protagonist and the story are never lost. Every little detail has a place of importance throughout. The mystery of Monster is revealed in little tantalizing bits all along, allowing the viewer freedom from feeling overwhelmed at the end. Nothing is left unsatisfied or unturned, and everything ties together so neatly. Perverse and violent subject matter is balanced with episodes so loving and meaningful that you feel the impact of the real world - positively, viscerally, bone-chillingly - within every scene. I feel so honored to have watched this. I sincerely cannot recommend Monster enough. 10/10. Absolute perfection."
tt0434706,"And yes, that is how good it is. Can a movie question all the human natures yet still promoting good values? Can a movie be smart and mature as well as being widely understandable? ""Monster"" has it all, yet it's only an ANIME.Don't be surprised. If you think low of animes, I am definitely not gonna persuade you into any. The only thing I want to say here is fact. And the only fact is, ""Monster"" almost made all the mystery thrillers fade away, real-set productions and animes alike.All those ordinary mystery thrillers before Monster, were only selling the performances, the production values and gores. That could even be said about Silence of the Lambs. After all, it's not anyone's fault. It's the nature of any feature-length movies. No matter how many dimensions can you put inside a feature length film, it's still so hard to pull every threads ahead easily. The other problem is you won't have enough memorable characters to talk about.(L.A.Confidential is the rare case that overcame all these barriers) It almost feels like we are crying for a great series in this genre that gave you enough time to connect, to digest and enjoy the subtlety of realism behind it.Ironcially, the one that stood out was made in Japan, about a story in Germany. There is no need to mention the connections between the two countries, but if you have an eye for history and social context, ""Monster"" is for you. Don't worry it's only about the length of a full season of ""24"". Let me also tell you about the other bottom lines. Most obviously, ""Monster""'s concentration is not the stylish drawing. It's certainly not competing with ""Naruto"" or this kind of anime in terms of number of colors and CGI utilization. But this is not to say that Monster is inferior artistically. Ordinary people is the only thing it is trying to do right, and they did it right. You will probably see some of the most fascinating human expressions as well as interactions in any art form. Another bottom line for Monster is that it's NOT FOR CHILDREN. Try to make children understand ""Monster"" is as cruel as putting them in the illusion of the Revelation. So, if you are not sure you can handle all the dark sides of human nature, don't watch it either.Actually, for those who have seen ""Monster"" they don't need the Joker to tell them how weak is our daily morality. But ""Monster"" is illustrating this problem with one exception--our own dedication to make things right. It is discussing this topic in a more detailed and socially responsible way so it also can be very educating after all.I will give no further story about ""Monster"" and suggest any IMDb user over 18 years old to give it a try. At least, rent the first 10 episodes to decide if you will like it. Although, the answer is almost for sure.The only reason I deducted 1 star from my rating is its ending, which could have been so much better. Anyway, it's already a very satisfying story with a lot to reflect on. Thanks God I saw it when I was morally confused. It really gave me some clues."
tt0434706,The plot twist at the shows start made me intrigued to watch more but I felt it went down hill from their. I like how they told the audience lots about the characters personality but later on it felt more like a drawback especially for the character Jonah. When Jonah killed and sent people to do his work it was surprising at first because i didn't know but slowly got boring because it was expected why should I be surprised a powerful bad persons doing a bad thing. I feel like episode 8 was really the tipping point because it didn't really add anything to the story. The father and daughter were likeable but I felt like the whole episode could've been a montage of him training. Knowing about their backstory didn't add anything to the story.I am 10 chapters into Monster and I want to keep watching because I love this genre but I don't know if I should. Does it get any better? Or should I just drop it?
tt1606375,"First off i am definitely not the demographics this show was trying to capture. I am a United States Marine and I really don't think the writers had a guy like me in mind. All I can say is I'm so glad I took the time to watch this show. I absolutely loved it and have now watched the series twice. Its not action packed or anything like that. It is all about the writing and the characters. Just brilliant from start to finish and is a show the entire family can watch together. Maggie Smith if you ever read these comments just know you played my favorite character out of any series I've ever watched. You made this show absolutely perfect! If you are debating on whether or not to give this show a try take it from me, you wont want the show to ever end..."
tt1606375,"I can't hold this back. I enjoyed every moment Maggie Smith was on scene. I was a bit sceptical in the beginning, but her performance is simply stellar. I laughed out loud alone at home watching her unique moments in the show. This is simply not comparable to anything I saw before in any other shows or movies. She is a treasure."
tt1606375,"I'll agree that the British know how to do period drama better than anyone (certainly better than us Americans) and this is no exception. You'll be captivated immediately and hours will go by before you realize you've spent an entire afternoon in front of your television set. The relationships built between all characters of this show are what tie it up in a nice, fluffy (although not always pretty) bow. Brilliantly written and set in lush, vibrant surroundings with detailed costuming, this drama series should set the bar for others. No busy dialog or wasted scenes, just good, solid craftsmanship in every episode of this poignant family story. You'll do well to invest in seasons 1 and 2. Looking forward to the arrival of season 3!"
tt1606375,"I have to say I loved Downton Abbey, and thought it was one of the better programmes airing this year along with Luther, Sherlock and the stunning Channel 4 drama Mo. Downton Abbey was beautifully produced, well cast and interesting, when it was first advertised it looked as though ITV had a hit and from the first episode I think Downton Abbey lived up to that expectation.I for one loved how elegant Downton Abbey was. The photography was beautiful and skillful, while the scenery was breathtaking and the costumes were exquisite. The scoring was also very good, often very hypnotic and beautiful. The direction was controlled, the episodes were well paced and for me the characters were believable my favourites being Violet and Robert.The writing in general was another strength. It was witty in a subtle way, is often funny and could be heart warming and poignant too, the best coming from Violet and Mrs Hughes I felt. The only bit of dialogue that rang false, and this is such a minor criticism, is Robert's ""Downton is my third parent and my fourth child"" which came across as somewhat cheesy. And the stories were well written and as believable as the characters, not to mention pretty original.And of course the acting was excellent. Maggie Smith was perfect as Violet. She plays this sort of character well, and she had such good timing and dialogue. Plus I love her in costume. Hugh Bonneville was dashing, and I cannot get over how beautiful Michelle Dockery was here. Jessica Brown-Findlay was also fine as another of my favourite characters Lady Sybil, and Phyllis Logan was always good value though I would love to see more of her if and when the series returns.In conclusion, Downton Abbey was a wonderful series thanks to the great cast and production values especially and I cannot wait to see more. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
tt1606375,"I was hooked after the first five minutes and come heaven, hell or high water, I was going to see Downton Abbey twice, the second time to pick up the points which I knew would be too fast, and possibly convoluted, to follow the first time round. I have watched Masterpiece since the inaugural with Alistair Cooke, and I can't remember anything as engaging and entertaining as this. As a cousin of an English family with deep affection for the monarchy and respect for the aristocracy, my perspective is an odd mix of Democratic ideals, old-time Republican values and curiosity about and appreciation of the social structure which prevailed so long in England. Downton Abbey appears to present a very balanced depiction of the social, political, economic and historical forces which drove the lives and fortunes of the classes and produced strange and almost incomprehensible behavior to comply with an unwritten, all-pervasive code. I am completely fascinated by the events and reactions and what would appear to be almost puppet-like behavior on occasion. I pray for a sequel."
tt1606375,"What can i say? Since I saw the first season I've been an unconditional fan of Downton Abbey. I think it's one of the most historically accurate and refined series of recent years.Over the course of six seasons, we have been following the life and adventures of the Crawley family, which has lived in Downton Abbey for generations. We also follow the lives of house servants, with all their quarrels, ambitions to rise in life, and leave behind service in the big house. And it is rare to find a series with as much respect and appreciation for historical rigor as it has shown over the six seasons. An enormous effort has been made to make real the historical period in which everything happens, which does not exceed fifteen years (1912-1926). A short time span between the six to seven years the show aired, which allowed the cast's natural aging to dispense with make-up gimmicks to forge the characters' aging.The script, created and written by Julian Fellowes, is interesting and covers well hot topics from that historical period: the sinking of the Titanic, the First World War, the political turn of Russia, the rise of Nazism, the emancipation of women, the loss of influence of aristocratic families etc. We can really see how all this has changed society, political life, mentality. We felt transported to that time to see how this noble family had a way of life threatened with extinction by the rapid advancement of time. Serious themes, in fact, but lightly approached and with room for moments of perfectly British humor, in charge of strong characters like Violet, who is against everything modern, and Mrs. Pattmore, always with a sharp tongue. There are no villains here ... despite some classic antagonists appearing in certain seasons (such as Bates's ex-wife) the one who comes closest to a villain is first footman Thomas Barrow, although last season be a true redemption for the character. In addition to it, we have some situations where generally good or neutral characters antagonize each other. This is the case of the Crawley sisters, where rivalry and mutual grudge prevail, while blood ties unite them, or Violet and Isobel, who cherish mutual love and hatred.The cast is excellent and congratulations. Maggie Smith, a veteran, never disappoints us by impersonating the perfect Victorian lady. Hugh Bonneville was perfect in the role of Robert. Laura Carmichael and Michelle Dockery are amazing in the roles of the Crawley sisters. Jim Carter is the perfect butler and makes a great pair with Phyllis Logan. A word of appreciation, too, for Elizabeth McGovern, Jessica Findlay, Brendan Coyle, Joanne Froggatt, Robert James-Collier, Sophie McShera, Lesley Nicol, Penelope Wilton, Kevin Doyle, Siobhan Finneran, Dan Stevens, Lily James, Jeremy Swift, Sue Johnston and Zoe Boyle.With sleek production and smooth photography, magnificent scenery (Highclere Castle's choice was very wise and made the house an additional character to the plot, which proves that I am right when advocating location shooting rather than abusive use of the green screen Downton Abbey is a true time machine. Grand, magnificent, it is certainly one of the best period television series of this decade."
tt1606375,I absolutely loved all six seasons. Was sad to see it end. Would love to see a 7th season or at the very least a movie.
tt1606375,"I remember the '70s and another Series which was cut more or less in the same parameters as this one, and that was ""Usptairs, Downstairs"".This too was a masterpiece of a social study, of the times at the turn between the 19th and early 20th Century.The only difference was that it was set in a City based household, while ""Downton Abbey"" is set in the very elegant English countryside.Both series display the best of British Theatre and Cinema, in terms of production teams, actors, technicians and general staff.It is absolutely to be considered high quality movie-making, even though meant for the home screen.Everyone, but everyone, in this series, knows his business and does portray his own character with honesty and truth.There is no dull moment, due to a skillful editing of scenes that are almost put together like in an elegant dance sequence.It is a very intelligent show that explores every facet of Society as it was structured (so far, in season 1 and 2), before, during and right after World War I, and as people behaved and felt back on the Homefront, being so detached, yet totally involved with the destinies of those men sent abroad to fight.It is no melodrama in the classic sense of the word. It is an honest depiction of what people ""downstairs and upstairs"" went through during those years. The conventions, the rigid rules, the traditions, all changing just in a ten year period and being uprooted and twisted by the new winds of war.There is something for everybody here. You want a thrilling story? Check! You've got it. You want love and romance? Check! You've got it. You want a social drama? Check! You've got it. You want a war drama? Check! You've got it too.It's a very human story of all characters on board of this static ship that is ""Downton Abbey"". As firm as the Rock of Gibraltar one might say. And yet, not so static after all... Lots is happening here, and this, day by day.Just think of the nightmare to have a sudden dinner invitation. The kitchen is in uproar, serving hands are missing, the masters are nervous, and everything seems to be doomed from the beginning, but then, somehow, everything comes together beautifully, like by magic... Magic? Let's say blood and a lot of sweat...I started this saying that it was addictive, and indeed it is. AFter an episode is over you immediately want to jump back in and watch the next to see how it goes on.I only have Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD and I am already asking for the 3rd Season to appear, just to know what happens next.I simply can't wait... I hope it pops up soon."
tt1606375,"DOWNTON ABBEY is the kind of ""Masterpiece Theatre"" material that the British do with such finesse that one can only sit back and marvel at the sets, costumes, music, and above all, the performances that are all on an extraordinarily high level.The moment the first series ended, I wanted to see more--so no doubt I'll be ordering my copy of Season 2. Central among the gifted performers are Maggie Smith (as the Dowager Countess Violet), Hugh Bonneville as the Earl of Grantham, and Elizabeth McGovern as Cora, his American wife. But all of the lesser roles are played to perfection with special mention for Brendan Coyle as John Bates, Joanne Froggatt as Ana, Michelle Dockery and Laura Carmichael.Complicit in schemes involving wicked behavior are two of the downstairs help played brilliantly by Siobhan Finneran and Rob-James Collier as Thomas, both of whom cast a shadow over the household.The plot has dialog that is always witty and good for a quick chuckle or a gasp of disapproval and the character motivations are all played out in a convincing manner true to each person involved.Very compelling to view the fluid story unfold with its many sub-plots and shadings of the class warfare that existed in the U.K. then and now.Absolutely one of the most rewarding and richly satisfying shows from Great Britain that have come along in recent years. The color photography amid location settings create the proper atmosphere for the entire story which takes place just before WWI among a wealthy titled household undergoing some major changes inside the castle walls."
tt1606375,"OK so I'll admit, Downton isn't a academic study of social change, nor is it entirely original ( let's be honest) - but it doesn't pretend to be! Does that make it any less of a excellent drama? No! Does That decrease the clever, witty and delicious writing? No! Does it cloud the ( at many moments) wonderful acting? No! Admittedly it isn't hard core drama - but it was lovely, it made me feel warm, it let me get all cross and annoyed (in a nice way), it got me exited - and soothed.Honestly what more can you ask for??Maggie Smith is excellent as the snooty Dowageress, Brendan Cole does Mr Bates very well - and Joanne Froggat (who I only manage to catch on tele occasionally sadly) who was equally lovely.It was all just lovely!"
tt1606375,"At 19 minutes in I was hooked.I remember when Lady Marjorie Bellamy of Upstairs, Downstairs died on the Titanic and the impact it had on my family. We felt this because of the investment we had made in the series.This is a series where one can become just as addicted.The lives and loves of the Grantham and the Crawly family are well-written and performed beautifully. The castle and the grounds a pleasure to look at, as are the costumes of the time.As Elizabeth McGovern and I are equal in age, and I have grown up watching her on the silver screen, hers was a warming and dignified touchstone for me personally.The cast couldn't be better suited for their roles, not one can be called a weak link.Maggie Smith has a presences all her own, making each of her projects shine.I am on episode four and can't wait for the remainder.Once again our cousins across the pond show us ""how good drama"" can be."
tt1606375,"This is beautifully filmed, with authenticity and societal values inherent in both script and acting. The story weaves in and out of two layers of society -- the masters and the servants -- giving us glimpses into the power struggles occurring on each level, and the colourful characters who inhabit both. I particularly enjoy seeing the large-scale production involved in taking care of a household of this magnitude, and the care taken with all the details. Given today's rapid pace, it's almost peaceful to watch this deliberately slowed pace, and to get a genuine sense of what it was like to be an estate-owner in this period. Housemaids who gossip, independent young men who don't appreciate the butler's code of honour, catty women and genteel sophisticates all combine to make this a very enjoyable romp among the rich of yesteryear!"
tt1606375,"It reminds me of typical soap operas: shallow black and white characters, all good or all evil, lousy and predictable plots, silly intrigue, cheesy dialogue. If had lived in those times and under those circumstances, first thing I'd done would have been to kill myself.Other than that it is somehow fun to watch and I can't quite put my finger on it. Is it the actors? They're definitely a treat. I love the kind of English they speak, it's nice to hear something intelligible for a change (I watch too many US shows). Is it middle-aged lord Fauntleroy (Earl Robert Crawley), whose only concern day in day out seems to be what to wear, when to wear it and how to wear it. Seriously, what's with that uniform he wears from morning to evening, it's hilarious :) Thanks to this show I now understand better why the french needed guillotines :) I guess this show is what is called a guilty pleasure."
tt1606375,"Julian Fellowes' intelligent (and sophisticated) take on pre-World War I society of aristocrats and worker-bees is smart-writing on the changes we will see over the next 25 years, encompassing two major wars and a great depression. The writing and the casting make this many steps above ""soap opera"" as the themes of social mobility and aristocratic incompetence are sharply etched.All of it pleased me, from the smallest character to the dozen or so leads, lead off by the always-brilliant Maggie Smith. This is to be enjoyed for both its eye-candy (Downton Abbey) and its themes of rich- and-poor dilemmas. Gorgeously shot with accurate art-direction. Wonderful all the way around."
tt1606375,"For me at least Downton Abbey was elegant, controlled and subtly witty. The scenery, of course, is very good. (anyone interested can find short interviews with actor Hugh Bonneville and writer Julian Fellowes via youtube and be infected with their enthusiasm as well as getting an explanation, if you need one, of the setting) The house is suitably dramatic and the fabrics, the costumes, the camera shots of ringing bells and curious meal courses in the form of fences of asparagus, the morning light, or lit windows across the lawn, and the smooth work of all the actors make it something to watch and be both interested and relaxed. There is just enough drama and just enough calm, nothing seems overdone, and (after two episodes) the characters, as it switches between moments of their various days, are none of them an unwelcome change from the view of the last. It is a costume drama but 1912 after all was just as real as 2010 and it is, quite separate from costumes, about people, several different people, house workers and owners, their motives, their histories, pain, relationships, scheming allegiances, awkwardness or ease, old ways and the coming of those things we now call modern electric lights, the middle classEnjoyable so far. However, if you find these things dull, if you need constant shocks, use the word inoffensive as an insult or dislike all period dramas, scenery or rich peoplestay away. It's not hard to do."
tt1606375,"This is not the sort of show I would willingly watch, but my wife wanted to see it, so I'm along for the ride. The acting and dialog are absolutely perfect. In fact, the show is worth watching just for the character Violet (Lord Grantham's mother) played by Maggie Smith. She has hilarious lines in every scene she's in, and delivers them perfectly. Perfect dry English humor. The automobiles used in the show are amazing. Almost characters themselves. Most of all, this show has inspired me to treat my own servants better. I've been working on learning all their names, even the second footmen. Of course, the show has been the cause of some disagreement in our house. My wife sees the good side of Lady Mary, but I just can't see it (the actress who plays the character does so splendidly, though)."
tt1606375,"The show starts in April 1912 with the news of the sinking of the Titanic. Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) has no son and the heir is on board. The new heir is distant cousin Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) who is a small Manchester lawyer. The easiest solution is to push oldest daughter Mary (Michelle Dockery) onto the new heir. Sibling rivalry can be cruel on plain middle daughter Edith (Laura Carmichael). The youngest Sybil (Jessica Brown Findlay) is sweet and independent. The staff working downstairs is led by Mr. Carson (Jim Carter). Mr. Bates (Brendan Coyle) suffers a leg injury from the Second Boer War and is hired by Robert Crawley. Thomas (Rob James-Collier) and Miss O'Brien (Siobhan Finneran) the villains of the downstairs world. The upstairs and downstairs worlds of Downton Abbey is changed over the years.This is an addictive soap opera wrapped in a costume drama. That's the genius of this show. The episodes move along quickly in intervals of months. It's about big dramas and delicious personalities. All of it anchored by great relationships whether it's Mary and Matthew or Bates and Anna. At this point, I hope the show ends properly and doesn't lose its way. It does tend to hit on the big historical points a lot. The big loss at the end of season 3 does concern me a little but that's the way of modern TV."
tt1606375,"...and this show is the perfect example. I managed to watch both seasons in just 2 days. It was like reading a good book, I just couldn't put down my laptop :) I am doing the second round right now, taking it slower and enjoying it minute by minute.I have to start by pointing out that the writing is not perfect. The plot is not exactly new, you may have seen or read something similar a thousand times before. The lack of originality in writing is usually a deal-breaker for me but in this case, I must say that I am astonished by how much I like this particular show. I believe there are several factors responsible for that.Firstly, there's the acting. The characters in the show may seem kind of black & white at first but as the story continues and plot unravels, you realise there's more than meets the eye to everyone involved. The actors are doing superb job peeling of the layers and showing the viewer what's hidden underneath. Also, I feel it's very simple to connect with the characters, there are those you instantly like and root for and those you're almost allergic to but even they may surprise you and make you question your point of view.Second element that puts this show on the top is its visual side. The costumes are highly detailed and altogether breathtaking. I don't remember when was the last time I was so inspired, the fashion of the era was so beautiful and the show displays it in all its glory. I also enjoy the environment of Downton. The show was shot in a real location and it's not just another piece of studio work that makes you claustrophobic. You get the sense of real space in every scene, every shot, which is so rare these days with most of movies and TV shows using computer technology all the time.The last thing I feel I have to mention is the music. The scoring in Downton Abbey is very delicate and yet very powerful. It perfectly underlines the story.In conclusion, I cannot say there's no place for criticism and improvement in Downton Abbey but despite its insufficiencies it's still one of the best shows on television these days because it stays true to certain standards that we might have forgotten lately and I am truly thankful for such a beautiful reminder..."
tt1606375,Downton Abbey is the embodiment of excellence. Well written with intelligent and inspiring storylines. The cast is superb and the show rises above the mediocrity that is all too prevalent in the entertainment industry.
tt1606375,"Back in the 1980s Granada made two long drama serials at almost the same time. One was ""Brideshead Revisited"" based on Evelyn Waugh's novel and the other was ""Jewel in the Crown"" – the dramatisation of Paul Scott's extraordinary ""Raj Quartet"". Both these series were masterpieces and if you watch them today you will find they have stood well the test of time. The drama tradition of Granada, of some of the other commercial companies and, of course, of the BBC is strong and is something of a jewel in the crown of British television. It is also an important source of revenue, not least in the United States, where posh British TV has a small but well-heeled following. This brings me to ""Downton Abbey"", superficially in the great tradition and with obvious links also to the very successful and ground-breaking ""Forsyte Saga"" and ""Upstairs Downstairs"" of the 1960s and 1970s. Downton is set in the second and third decades of the twentieth century and we have moved from Edwardian complacency and excesses through the horrors of the Great War to the early 1920s. As with ""Upstairs Downstairs"" we see life, and to an extent history, through the eyes of the aristocracy and simultaneously from the perspective of those in the Servants' Hall.Over the 16 episodes that have so far been transmitted, spanning the years 1912-1920, the stories are reminiscent of a Soap like ""Eastenders"" or ""Coronation Street"" in that there are episode ending cliff-hangers and improbably extreme story developments. Every historic event from the sinking of the Titanic through women's suffrage, the Irish independence movement, the Battle of the Somme, the post-war Flu epidemic and many others is a trigger for something to happen in the plot. In addition we have adultery, murder, homosexuality, alcoholism, illness and recovery or death, the black market, inter-class affairs and marriage, and most of the seven deadly sins in sharp relief. The stories are often signalled rather obviously and it is an amusing parlour game to predict what will happen next - as with any soap. Taken as a whole the story is totally preposterous and the ""issues"" are not handled with any subtlety at all – there is none of the restraint of a Galsworthy, a Waugh or a Scott.The starting point for Downton Abbey was in the creative mind of the writer Julian Fellowes and its main inspiration was clearly that author's film script for ""Gosford Park"" - which won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in 2002. But whereas this film lasts a couple of hours and was tightly directed by Robert Altman Downton goes on for 20 – and running! The characters are largely pastiches of real people. Maggie Smith, for example, is wonderful as the Dowager a figure straight out of Pantomime - Dame Maggie overtly seeks hisses from the stalls. Fine actors like Hugh Bonneville, Penelope Wilton and Dan Stevens struggle with a script that is always close to parody and sometimes spills over into farce. Indeed at times there is a slight sense that they know what they are being asked to say, or the absurd plot twist in which they are expected to participate, has moved into lampoon territory and that Mel Brooks or the Directors of ""Airplane"" or ""Something about Mary"" are in charge.The great strength of Brideshead Revisited, Jewel in the Crown and the Forsyte Saga is that the stories had passed the tough test of being seen as credible in the original novel format. They were great books before they became great television. The original screenplay of ""Downton Abbey"" has had none of the checks and balances that apply to the written word. And because the medium is only to be visual, and in a number of time-limited episodes, it is presumed that there is a need to provide colourful action rather than attempt any true characterisation. We are supposed to like the Earl of Grantham because he is a benevolent toff – fragile but caring with a true sense of noblesse oblige. But compare his character, which is utterly superficially sketched, with the way that Evelyn Waugh gradually introduces Lord Marchmain in Brideshead - we feel we know the Marquess long before we meet him. The same superficiality applies to Downton's ""below stairs"" characters most of whom are stereotypes we have met frequently before.The visual impact of ""Downton Abbey"" is strong and in this area the production values are high. The sets, both in the studio and on location, are beautifully designed and the costumes and other artifacts are good and look authentic. There is a strange paradox here which I suspect has led some to assume that because it looks good then it is good - perhaps ignoring the often wooden acting and sloppy direction. Downton's viewing figures are good and this is no doubt reflected directly in the income received from advertisers and the revenue from the sale of overseas rights and DVDs etc. - it is evidently a profitable venture. So a legitimate response to those critics who deplore the triviality of the series would be to never mind the quality and weigh the receipts.There is nothing really wrong with ""Downton Abbey"" if you see it for what it is – a Soap of fleeting interest with can pass the time on an autumnal evening. However Downton does take itself quite seriously at times and some of the acting is so pompously self-important that it can only be seen as light comedy, which it isn't meant to be, or over-written moralising trash - which at times it comes dangerously close to being."
tt2085059,"I just finished Black Mirror and the first word that comes to mind is...wow! I've never seen anything like it. The stories are all shocking, disturbing and thought provoking. Most of them are about how technology is changing, has changed us, and not always for the better. It's almost like a satire of how media obsessed we have gotten. Each episode really makes you think afterwards and will make you want to talk about what happened. Every episode is like a mini movie, there're stand alone episodes and every episode has an incredible cast filled with A-list actors. While everyone will have their own favorite episodes, every single one of them will make you think and there's not a ""bad"" episode in the entire series."
tt2085059,"You're reviewing the whole show here,not individual seasons or episodes. Don't give a low rating just because you didn't like Miley or the 5th series. Keep everything in context and just rate on your overall impression of Black Mirror. Carry on."
tt2085059,"I've been a longtime fan of Black Mirror. It had always felt like a modern Twilight Zone with a focus on the potential downsides of future technologies. With season 6 it feels like they threw the premise out the window and went with an anything goes approach to storytelling, including the supernatural. In addition, the overall quality of the writing has declined in seasons 5 and 6. The first 4 seasons of the show is among my favorite TV shows ever, but they seem to have mostly lost their touch.It's not that the most recent seasons are irredeemable because there are some pretty good episodes, but they are nowhere near the high bar that was set by the early seasons. Don't believe me? Go watch from the beginning and it will become obvious how much the show has changed. None of the newer episodes are remotely close to the quality of ""The Entire History of You"", ""White Bear"", and ""White Christmas."" Even the weaker episodes of seasons 1-4 are significantly better than most of seasons 5 and 6.I suppose it's nice to get some new episodes of Black Mirror even if it isn't what it used to be, but I was hoping for much better. Despite my misgivings about the last two seasons, I hope there ends up being a season 7 because I am a big fan of the anthology series format. Overall, I still think the show deserves a solid 8 when considering the entirety of the series to this point."
tt2085059,"This is purely for seasons 1-4 and for Bandersnatch from season 5.Season 5 was boring and silly. Season 6 is a mixture of terrible episodes and some quite well done episodes that have nothing whatsoever to do with Black Mirror.Seasons 1 through 4 are masterpieces. Some episodes are better than others, like with any Anthology series. But the good ones are just next-level, even when you have to suspend disbelief sometimes (full nervous system VR systems the size of an M&M - no, not unless everything else is up to the same level of tech!).It seems that once a series peaks, we just have to accept that that's it, it's done, it will never get up there again. For me the high water marks were CROCODILE, METALHEAD and WHITE BEAR. Though I have to say, I still got back and watch the speech from 15 MILLION MERITS for the thrill of it. It's too good.4 seasons, 1 special - that's pretty good. Now we need something of equal calibre!""Somebody"" removes negative reviews so I hope this one will just sail through."
tt2085059,"Black Mirror is one of the most original and best Mini-Series ever created. Each episode tells a different story about the modern world we live in and the technology we all love and while not all, most of them are fascinating. They are all filled with a-list stars and made by great directors. Each stand alone episode is thought provoking and filled with enough drama and suspense to keep you at the edge of your seat. While there are a few episodes that are not as good when compared to the others, most of them are fantastic. This show gets compared to The Twilight Zone a lot and while it's a pretty good comparison, I think Black Mirror is actually a lot better. It's hard to explain how incredible this show is so just go watch it."
tt2085059,"Amazing British anthology series with a very intriguing concept. The premise: taking contemporary phenomena (ranging from the wild popularity of talent shows on TV to the impact of social media and smartphones on our lives) as a starting point and speculate how such phenomena could/would evolve in the future. Each episode tells a different story with different protagonists and focuses on a different theme. Of course, the series doesn't explore the beneficial aspects or any positive trends - (where would the fun be in that?) - but clearly approaches its topics from a pessimistic, cynical point of view (hence the title). As the show's creator Charlie Brooker ('Dead Set') puts it: ""...They (the different stories) are all about the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy.""The resulting mix of bleak sci-fi, drama, satire and black comedy makes for highly intelligent Television and ranks among the most original and entertaining shows I've ever come across. The writing and directing are excellent and the cast includes such talented thesps as Domhnall Gleeson, Rory Kinnear, Toby Kebbell, Hayley Atwell, Jon Hamm, Jason Flemyng and Rupert Everett - to name but a few. Unique, fascinating and highly recommended. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
tt2085059,"Brilliant.Absolutely brilliant.This is NOT anti-utopian, it is an actual mirror of a utopian idea gone terribly wrong.I've only watched 3 episodes so far and each one has made me think, made me go back and look again, made me ask myself why this had never occurred to me before.I would call this sci-fi in the richest sense of the genre.... it is not about science, but how science affects human beings. The one thing that never seems to change is us. Technology evolves, mutates, advances and declines, but human beings, our feelings, our courage, fears, and desires remain within us.I love this show. I hope you will love it too. And I hope you will think."
tt2085059,"The double entendre that is Black Mirror's name summarizes the show perfectly. The first interpretation is that the show looks inwards, at the darker aspects of humanity and society. This is done through the theme of technology, hence the second meaning. The black mirror is the screen that rules our lives.Each self-contained episode is brilliantly crafted and produced. The stories are compelling and the acting is phenomenal. This show is not for those looking exclusively for entertainment, as the episodes leave you with a distinctly empty feeling. Although this is obviously the intent, one cannot help but wonder at the creators' bleak outlook on the world. The presence of bestiality in the first episode could very well deter some viewers, but I would remind them that the show is Twilight Zone-esque in structure as well as theme. The episodes may be watched in any order, as they are all completely independent of one another. The second episode in particular is storytelling of the highest form.Black Mirror is disturbing in the best possible way. It unflinchingly explores the issues of society through deeply intimate stories and characters and their interactions with technology. Let me be clear, it will not leave you feeling fulfilled. Watching it was an exhausting experience that shook me deeply. The thought provoking subject matter combine with powerful, desolate stories and excellent performances to create one of the most unique and brilliant shows that I have seen. It not only holds the viewer's attention while it plays, it enthralls your thoughts long after the credits roll."
tt2085059,"I have only seen the first two installments of this series and but was impressed enough to leave a review. Charlie Brooker has popped out of the internet at times when I least expect it revealing the more unsettling aspects of our culture through his program Screenwipe and others. That was my first exposure to Doug Stanhope, a comedian who among others brings us closer together via demonstrations of how media and technology are changing our society and rarely for the better. Black Mirror arrives in the form of anthologized science fiction in the vein of the Twilight zone. It is a series that examines our society's relationship with the media and how it allows us to both shape our own identity and imprison us in a space where empathy and truth are weaknesses and something to hide in order to get ahead. I have always been interested in futurists and Brooker seems to fill the requirements for one. There is nothing in the first two installments that do not reflect current trends in our collective behavior but instead extrapolates where current trends in communications technology; avatars, social media and reality television might lead us if we do not seek to preserve what is beautiful and pure about our collective consciousness and humanity. Having seen reviews here that feel there is no commentary embedded within these stories I couldn't disagree more. As the title suggests, Brooker's Black Mirror shows us a dark reflection of our selves and allows us to evaluate these scenarios through our own emotional filters. There are no blatant soap box messages but I interpreted the narratives as cautionary tales and would hope that no one, when confronted with them, would hope for these near futures. The only thing holding them back from becoming reality is our own resistance to complacency and purely spectator culture. Beyond these philosophical aspects, the program is incredibly well produced and executed in my opinion. The characters and sets create convincing realities and I was never once drawn out of the story due to poor acting, scripting or characterizations. I could not recommend this series more and hope that it will continue on. Congratulations to Brooker and company for their work and their apparent concern for all of us."
tt2085059,This is the biggest surprise i came across these last couple of years. This series is one of the best i've seen. Every episode is unique yet criticizes the same absurd society we're living in. I was shocked at the great filming/acting/directing and of course writing of these different stories. My personal favorite would be episode 2. The most futuristic but also the most accurate representation of what most of our lives look like right now. Just saw in a review that a guy stopped watching after 20 minutes at the second episode. That's the biggest mistake he could do. Definitely the best episode. I wont miss anything else Charlie Brooker does and i'm patiently waiting for the DVD to come out. I hope this also gets a Blu-Ray version and maybe some new episodes after wards?
tt2085059,"...season five was bad (episode 1), mildly acceptable (episode 2) and are you kidding me? (episode 3). Miley Cyrus? This series started out as an inventive, original and disturbing show. When it became ""Americanized"", it went downhill fast. Please, either return to the original premise, or don't put out more trash."
tt2085059,-1 because of that Season 5 that I wished I never knew existed.
tt2085059,"Latest series is on the rails, by the book, it almost feels like series 6 has been written by AI.Hold on. Is that going to be the final twist - that Charlie Brooker got ChatGPT to write series 6? That would explain the lack of plot twists and the by-the-numbers predictability.If Charlie Brooker is playing 4D chess and has willingly created a poor series 6 to make a brilliantly executed point to the suited streamer overlords that AI cannot create as well as humans, then hats off to him. I'll revise this review to an 11/10.But if that's not the case, then what did happen between series 5 and 6?"
tt2085059,If you watch this whole series...you can see the reality of it...and it's horrifying. I believe that this series really makes you think about how easily and fast things can get out of control. It was an awesome show!
tt2085059,"I found myself irritated with one of the reviewers who gave this mini-series a terrible review because it left him feeling ""disturbed"". Ermm.... I think that's the intention....As many others have pointed out, the series is superbly put together: the actors are great; the script, if anything, is minimalist and the production excellent.This isn't reality TV. This picks out the darkest aspects of how are future in this this modern age could end up, in extremis....Personally, I think it's a Facebook/Twitter/Flickr/Android/iPhone/Tab/internet horror story and whilst I think it's probably too brutal for most people, it is a reflection of how we give up and of ourselves to the digital, overwhelmingly public way that the world now wants us to be.I love the show. Will it change my FB or other behavior? No but, truth be told, I might be watching out of the corner of my eye...."
tt2085059,"Watching it was disturbing and shocking at the same time. Depressive in a way, but also genius and defying! The way it makes you question and think about reality and our modern technological ages it's brilliant!And although being fictional and mostly sci-fi, it's so realistic in the scariest way! It's not about tech... it's about us and our ""human nature"", the good and the bad, our best and worst as humans and that is definitely the most disturbing aspect of it all. Worth seeing it all with detailed attention cause it's probably one of the most intelligent and critical TV series done recently!! Thank you Mr Brooker and all the team!P.S.: the first two episodes are probably the most disturbing ones and it's curious that all the bad reviews focus only in the first one... Reading those bad reviews only make more sense to the all series idea... Shocking uh? But wouldn't we be all in the pub watching it?"
tt2085059,"To sum up this series for me is quite easy, It's a dark look at what could be, and a very deep look at the worst of human nature. The cast and set are different every time, but one theme I found recurring was that each episode was extremely haunting, and it definitely gets the viewer thinking about what could be if the world was just a little bit different. I don't think Black Mirror will appeal to everyone because some themes are a slightly uncomfortable especially in the pilot episode. So far the actors that have been cast have done an amazing job, and the writers have managed to make some far fetched ideas seem graspable. Basically this series is unlike anything else on TV and for that it gets a big thumbs up from me. I don't want to write any spoilers, but what I will say is this if you want a drama with dark twist or a series that is completely Original make it Black Mirror."
tt2085059,"In the new golden age of tv shows, this one is on another level. That's saying something, considering the expectation we have now. Black Mirror is an anthology series that, if you follow dope stuff, has achieved that rare-air status that if there's another season you feel blessed. It's that good imo. Absolutely a 21st Century version of The Twilight Zone. And it keeps coming back, but on nobody's timeline. And A list stars just flock to it?! I don't really love each and every episode. But there are so many episodes of this program that really leave ya shaken. Because us doesn't seem that far removed from a plausible scenario. Check it out. It'll make ya wonder......"
tt2085059,"When I talk about this show I always tell people to ""Just skip the first episode and watch it at the end."" Other than that it's a mind blowing, ground breaking, and terrifying series. It shows exactly where humankind is currently heading and has already reached in some instances. A mirror can only show a reflection of what's already there so Black Mirror is an apt title.I've watched all the episodes multiple times and wish like crazy they had continued the show. It was one of the truly rare shows willing to take an unflinching look at humanity and how screwed up it is, and how much worse it's getting. In my experience, those who don't like the show seem to prefer living with their head in the sand while humming loudly to drown out the noise. Ignorance doesn't change the world, seeing it for what it is and then choosing to be better is what can do it."
tt2085059,"Black Mirror is a British science fiction anthology television series created by Charlie Brooker. Each episode of the series presents a standalone story that explores the darker aspects of modern society, particularly the unanticipated consequences of the use of technology in our daily lives. The show explores various themes such as the impact of technology on society, privacy, surveillance, and human nature.The series is known for its dark and disturbing tone, and its ability to take a thought-provoking look at the ways in which technology is shaping our world. The show's episodes are diverse in terms of genre, tone, and style, with some episodes being more comedic and others being more dramatic and suspenseful.The acting in the series is also noteworthy, with a talented ensemble cast that delivers strong performances in each episode. The writing is also exceptional, with well-crafted and thought-provoking storylines that keep the audience engaged and thinking long after the episode has ended.One of the criticisms that could be made about the series is that some episodes are stronger than others, and some may not resonate with all audiences. Additionally, the series can be quite dark and disturbing, which may not be suitable for all viewers.Overall, I would recommend Black Mirror for fans of science fiction, anthology series, and those looking for a thought-provoking and thought-provoking series that explores the darker aspects of modern society and the impact of technology on our lives. The show's diverse episodes, talented ensemble cast, and well-crafted storylines make it a must-watch series. It's a unique and captivating series that keeps the audience thinking long after the episode has ended."
tt2085059,"Black Mirror has always been one of my favourite shows. It is completely different from everything else. It has been fresh, quirky and gripping in every respect. Every episode has been different and has transfixed me. It is now described as a Netflix original. It was on U. K TV years before it got to Netflix.I have been anxiously awaiting the release of season 6 which I've just binge watched over a couple of days.I was quite disappointed in Season 6 with some episodes having a familiar ring to them where I've seen very similar themes before, even in previous episodes.The best episode of season 6 from my perspective was episode 2 Loch Henry which was scary, original and brilliantly acted. Overall I found season 6 patchy and disappointing."
tt2085059,"I COULDNT tell i was watching black mirror through the whole 6th season. All the time I was waiting for that mind-f black mirror moment and plot where i really pause to process but I didn't get any.On joan is awful Salma presence felt like she was shooting a commercial rather than filming TV and wro wasn't strong.. such a waste for the amount of talented actors and actresses in 1 episode.On the Loch henry, it really felt just like watching a documentary, any random documentary only showing you behind the scenes except for the ending.Mazey Day, was a Don't Look Up wannabe TV which is very mediocre.I don't know what's happening to the show but bring us Black museum, white Christmas, Nosedive, White bear, Playtest creators...chatGBT, TikTok, Crypto, Podcasts...all of these addictive concepts and you went with a documentary..."
tt2085059,"Black Mirror is an anthology, meaning it is complied of different sci fi tales to make their seasons. This means the series doesn't really have any synopsis I can say, the only thing I can say is just watch the bloody show already. Every episode is different, some horror, some romance, some drama, and if you don't like the episode then just skip it, it's not like you'll miss anything as the next episode on your binge watch will be the complete opposite of what you just watched. As far as acting goes, it's top notch, stars like Jon Hamm, Daniel Kaluuya also appear on episodes bringing their amazing performances to the table. Every episode has their own cinematography, some bright and colorful, one episode will be black and white, really adding in on the unique feel of the whole thing. I would definitely call this show a masterpiece, but i almost gave it a 9 because of the 5th series. 2 episodes from the fifth series were pretty sh*te. Smithereens was great, so was Andrew Scott's performance. So yes, a masterpiece still, I won't let 2 bad episodes change that especially when compared to the works of art that the previous series had to offer. So ignore season 5 apart from Smithereens, Smithereens had a very important message and was a wonderfully shot and acted tale. Think of it as a mix of mini films. Now there may be some things that you may not find good, but there's always an episode for you. There 's twists, laughs, scares all in hour long episodes and tied up in a neat little bow just for you. And the Christmas Special was stunning, don't forget to watch that. But if that isn't enough, they have their own interactive film, Bandersnatch. An. Interactive. Film. You choose what the main character does, and it is awesome. So please, If you have the time, try watching this, you will not be disappointed.
Verdict: With something new every episode, Black mirror really gets to you, and in all the right ways. A+"
tt3398540,"Excellent characters incomparable to other anime or other tv series for that matter. You connect with each one in a deep way that and you just want to be rooting for all of them, even the opponents. 
PS I've learned a lot about volleyball also thanks to this and it just makes me want to play!"
tt3398540,"This is anime leaves me speechless, seriously. It's just so brilliantly done. Some episodes pass by really quickly because you enjoy them that much and some episode feel twice as long because of the shows brilliant pacing. This anime has brilliant comedy, I swear I've laughed so many times. I've also cried too. If this anime was more popular I swear it has the quality to be a top anime. Imagine an Anime that makes you laugh when you're sad and makes you cheerful when you're bored, just imagine an anime that makes reading this review totally worth every word. If you decide not to watch this show then you are seriously missing out. This is the only show I would call perfect. 10/10"
tt3398540,"Can I just say that I freaking LOVE Haikyu.The show itself is pretty simple. It follows the adventures of a boys' high school volleyball team, and it is a bit overdramatic at times, but it's so much fun!! It's hilarious, the characters are so easy to fall in love with, there's no constant peril or evil overlord or magical powers, it's just volleyball. It sounds pretty boring and stupid at first, but trust me, watch the first episode. You'll be blown away.The production quality is super as well. They never get lazy with the animation. The funny bits are perfectly worked into the show without ruining the intense bits. Every single episode is completely and totally worth it.I just don't really have much else to say. It's an amazing show all around."
tt3398540,Haiykuu is by farrrr the best sport anime and I say that without a doubt. This show is easy to get into (I mean- it got me hooked from the first 5 mins!!). The characters are amazing and interesting. The matches are so exciting and got me on the edge of my seat. And yet this show is soooo simple. It's brilliant. Its the fattest recommendation I can give you!
tt3398540,"This anime is very brilliantly crafted. Compelling characters, beautiful and strong openings, natural comedy and superb animation makes this anime a must watch. 10/10"
tt3398540,"Really enjoyed this well-made anime on Volleyball, I didn't know much about the sports and its rules, didn't realize so much strategy went into it and how important team play is. The plot is your typical shounen sports stereotype, an underdog who excels with determination, along the way he makes friends and each one in the team is a standout specialist. The anime is well-paced and keeps things exciting all throughout, there is lots of humor to give you big laughs. The storytelling utilizes the full spectrum of emotions from losses to win, from giving up to never giving in, from timidity to overconfident, from solo play to teamwork, it covers each aspect of the gameplay with relevant emotions. Another good side to the anime is the realistic gameplay, no over the board plays, and super moves. The characters are all likable, one of the few anime without having any evil guy in it.The anime itself is really good, got great art and colors. Did feel the music could have been better, nothing of it stands out in mind after a week of watching the anime.It was enjoyable enough for Binge-watch, so hopefully, you get the idea. Season 1 & 2 both were great, after a break of 2 years, I have binged watched Season 3 & Part 1 of Season 4 also, again they were really good."
tt3398540,"Wow. I really did not expect to fall down the rabbit hole that is Haikyuu!! I thought that the art style isn't one that I usually gravitate to but I was quickly won over by the story and characters. I loved all of the characters and their relationships and friendships with each other and it was inspiring to see the underdog climb to the top, that even though it seems as if one is disadvantaged, they can still succeed through sheer willpower and by working together with like-minded passionate people. Honestly, watching this made me regret not taking volleyball seriously during PE in high school."
tt3398540,"I never watch sports anime's but I loved this one! I really wish there were more seasons, because I want to see how far they go! My review is a must watch!!"
tt3398540,"This is my first ever anime series and I'm happy I got to catch up on this gem of a show! Though I hardly play sports nowadays but it revived my interest in athletics. It has all the emotions, great story and likable characters. It shows how to have passion for something you love and how it can take you to great heights! It's all about doing what you love and have a burning desire to excel in it.It inspired me that failure can be a stepping stone to success, importance of teamwork, believing in your abilities and ignoring your imperfections at the same time.PS Eagerly waiting for another season!"
tt3398540,"Had doubts watching this because I wasn't that much into voleyball but man oh man it's so entertaining now I am totally into it. You would like every character in this series even antagonists are hella nice, certainly a show to watch for sports lovers."

tt3398540,"This anime had sooooo many amazing reviews that I just had to watch it.*Very straightforward and raw impressions*Negative side:The story is very basic and extremely predictable. I like that it involves human feeling development, how team work develops and works but in general, I found it extremely boring, some episodes were engaging in the sense of introducing new characters but I don't think the overall growth of the characters and how the interact with each other was amusing. As I said, extremely predictable.-Positive side:
If you like volleyball a lot, you will of course find this entertaining because it talks a lot about technical plays and the role each player has in the team. Can be applied to any sport, of course. You get a lot of anime action and a lot of classic anime dialogs.Overall:
Not as entertaining and good as everyone said it would be and overall extremely predictable."
tt3398540,"I watched tons of tv series but trust me, It is the one which gives me goosebumps. The reason is, it carries the emotion of friendship, trust, and most importantly immense determination to surpass one's limit and reach another peak. I am simply grateful for such a beautiful script and a series of emotions.😍"
tt3398540,"Everybody's reactions, feelings, actions, sounds, directions perfectly doing. I love this anime. This is motivating also. I get goosebumps many time😊😚. I recommend to watch this anime series."
tt3398540,Man this sports anime give you exact the same feeling as you were playing the match. Must watch. The curiosity and excitement of what happens next ...the feeling is awesome.
tt3398540,"This anime must be watched by anyone who loves any kind of sports.It will make you laugh it will make yo wanna never give up It'll make u love every character even the opponents It'll make u wanna play volleyball no doubt It'll make you wanting to win any game.Im not good at words soo.U Gotta Watch This cause""We Haven't Lost Yet"""
tt3398540,"Haikyuu deserves a 10/10. The show is made up brilliantly and there's no filler episode were I spend my time on the phone. The pace of the show and the typical Anime serious moments in this are perfect, not to exaggerated. I swear I like Volleyball as a Sport, but never thought I'd watch an Anime about it. Haikyuu stays for team spirit, development, goals, nice humor, lovely and sad scenes. I found this masterpiece on Netflix and I'm not surprised this hasn't an equal hype like other sport Anime's ( Captain Tsubasa ), cause it's just Volleyball. Well then I tell you if you think like that you'll 100% miss an amazing and entertaining show. I'm super excited for next years season."
tt3398540,"I don't know nothing about volleyball but after this series I love with it. Best series , must watch and never miss it."
tt3398540,"I saw the great reviews and thought, how good can a volleyball manga be, the answer is a 11 out of 10! High flying action, great characters, excitement all the way through..... I could not stop watching! Exceeded every expectation I had about this show! I strongly advise you to stop reading this and go watch Haiku right now!"
tt3398540,I really don't have much expectations to this anime but when i started watching i just can't stop i have to watch the next episode most of the episode have suprises (almost all) this anime character developement is so nice and the animation its literally perfect and a great sense of humor this anime is really good you have to watch it.
tt3398540,"I've seen far more anime than most other 51 year-old Americans, but that still isn't a lot compared to younger folks who are obsessed with it. I mention this because my perspective, no doubt, is not that of a typical younger fan. So, while the other review, so far, is glowing and describes the show glowingly, I am not a fan and don't have the same sort of life experiences. Now I am NOT saying that ""Haikyuu!"" is a bad show...but I just didn't experience it the same way that the other reviewer did. As for me, I've watched a few anime series here and there and have watched a few hundred Japanese films...mostly live action. So keep this in mind as you read this.The story centers on an incredibly chipper and high-energy high school student in his first year. While Hinata loves volleyball, in middle school he barely got a chance to play at all due to the few kids in his school who wanted to play. He also has little experience and is quite short. In his one chance to play in a game, his team is soundly defeated and one of the opposing players, Kageyama, ends up going to the same high school as Hinata!! Considering how arrogant Kageyama is, it's not surprising that the two being fighting instead of working together as teammates. Naturally, they eventually learn the spirit of teamwork and soon their team goes from mediocre to amazing. Can the spirit of competition and teamwork take them to the top?Like many sports anime programs, the show is way over the top as far as how the various players act and react. Subtle, it ain't...but it is often quite enjoyable and the more you watch the more you get sucked into the story. The animation quality is about on par with any other anime, the writing quite nice and non-anime lovers should still appreciate the show. Among the best anime I have seen? No...but still well made and engaging."
tt3398540,I thought at first this would be good becuse I like sport anime's. I never have played volleyball besides a few times in pe class. I felt at some point in the series I started to get bored of watching it. There wasn't enough drama in the story. That says a lot becuse I love slice of life and they tension to be very chill with little drama sometimes. The character development was fine. The script wasn't anything special it was about average. The animation was good. I liked that it was set during high school. The plot seemd like it was gonna be good. But as it turned out the plot was very boring. Not much happened in this series. It need more drama really bad. The animation style was very good and well done. I would recommend this series to little to no people to be honest.
tt3398540,"Haikyuu is very addicting. It's magnificent, glorious and entertaining. It is flawless in almost every way possible so it has to be one of the greatest anime series in the world. It has brilliant comedy in every episode, I even cried so badly that I couldn't even breathe! The characters are inspirational and beautifully presented. Overall one of the best anime of all time, it's worth watching. I enjoyed every second of it and I don't hate anything about it. It makes so many people motivated to start or continue playing volleyball. It's also a great opportunity to learn some strategies and techniques if you want to improve your volleyball. It's pure perfection. 11/10"

When a show is as loved as this one is it rarely lives up to the expectations. Well, Peaky Blinders not only met those expectations but surpassed them in every way possible.

The series, set in post-World War I Birmingham, immerses viewers in the gritty and tumultuous world of the Shelby family, a gang of street-savvy criminals led by the enigmatic Thomas Shelby. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Tommy Shelby is nothing short of mesmerizing; his ability to convey the character's complexity, vulnerability, and ruthlessness ensures that viewers remain captivated by his every move. Each supporting character is equally compelling, from Helen McCrory's matriarchal Polly Gray to Paul Anderson's volatile Arthur Shelby, contributing to a rich tapestry of interconnected storylines that keep audiences hooked from one season to the next.The writing in ""Peaky Blinders"" is razor-sharp, with dialogues that are both thought-provoking and laced with a dark, poetic edge. The narrative is expertly crafted, weaving together themes of power, loyalty, ambition, and betrayal. Each episode propels the story forward, maintaining a relentless pace that never feels rushed. The show's ability to balance intense, action-packed sequences with quieter, character-driven moments is a testament to the skill of its writers and directors. This balance ensures that the stakes always feel high, making the viewer deeply invested in the outcomes of each character's arc.The historical setting of ""Peaky Blinders"" adds another layer of depth and authenticity to the series. The attention to detail in the costumes, set designs, and even the socio-political landscape of the time is impeccable.

The music not only enhances the emotional impact of the scenes but also helps to establish the show's distinctive identity.Moreover, the themes explored in ""Peaky Blinders"" resonate deeply with audiences.

tt2442560,"Listen guys, I appreciate the contrast between the old setting and the modern styling, but come ooooon!Season 5 just seems to have a complete lack of direction and content. It's like I'm constantly watching one movie trailer after another.
All the characters seem to have lost their substance. Everyone is so overdramatic. They're all doing stupid things that make no sense and sometimes look so unbecoming of their character.
Almost every scene is so dragged on to a point that they become boring. By the end of an episode I sometimes found if difficult to remember what it was about.Again, I have nothing against using modern styling and music to contrast the series' grey, gritty, and dirty time period, but it's so overused in season 5 that it's difficult to stay emersed and follow the story. It all feels so diluted now, so cheesy. Too bad."
tt2442560,"This is one of the best shows I've ever seen. It's a show where you can't be playing on your phone, cooking dinner or doing something else, it requires your undivided attention. It's a show that never gets stale. I can't remember ever being bored, even for one episode. I loved every second of every episode and I think you will to if you give it a chance. The entire cast is fantastic, led by the incredible gifted Cillian Murphy (who just won an Oscar for best actor). I've already watched this show twice from beginning to end. The new season just started and I'm sure it'll be just as good as the first."
tt2442560,"After the show, you cannot stop thinking about Thomas Shelby. I've never seen any movie characters that stay in your head like that."
tt2442560,"Peaky Blinders"" has received critical acclaim for its storytelling, performances, and production values. Fans of crime dramas, historical fiction, and character-driven narratives are likely to enjoy the series for its engaging plot and memorable character.. It's very much intriguing. The show's plot is filled with twists, turns, and political intrigue as the Shelby family navigates rival gangs, law enforcement, and internal power struggles. The storytelling keeps viewers on the edge of their seats and leaves them eager for more. It is known for its distinctive visual style, including the iconic flat caps worn by the Shelby gang members. The show's cinematography, music choices, and editing contribute to its unique and stylish aesthetic."
tt2442560,"I watched every second of all six series of Peaky Blinders and at no point did I think: ""Wow. This would make a really good dance work!"" I don't believe Benoit Swan Pouffer did either. What I think happened is that the artistic director of Rambert was looking for a story that would extend his dance company's reach beyond the usual narratives, chanced upon the hugely popular saga of the violent Shelby family and thought: ""Aha!""The resulting story, premiered to a hugely enthusiastic Birmingham audience, isn't bad. But never once does it feel felt or earned; it's all surface and no depth, a marketing person's fantasy, not an engaging work.The opening promises more than it ultimately delivers. Tommy Shelby's first world war gang of tunnellers emerge on stage from down low, pulling themselves upright into a phalanx of the damaged, shoulders twitching, eyes wide. Natasha Chivers's lighting, moody and magnificent, surrounds them in swirls of yellowish smoke.The one quality in Peaky Blinders that really does lend it to dance in the first place is the strength of its characters
Then there's a voiceover, intoned by poet and series regular Benjamin Zephaniah: ""You young men of the tunnelling brigade, you are all dead ... condemned to a life without a soul."" And we're off into the heavy chains and falling sparks of the industrial landscape of the Black Country, dominated by a grotesque factory foreman and women whose sharp elbows and quick marching steps demonstrate how invaluable they've been to the country while the men are gone.Try to be the best at what you do and remain silent like a alpha male like Thomas himself!..If you want to watch or download all peaky blinders series visit here!Linktr.ee/Since99now."
tt2442560,"Peaky Blinders is the rare diamond of a TV show that has great writing, great casting, great cinematography and a brilliant use of music.For the first 3 seasons, that is...
Already at season 4 it begins to go down - the writing is weaker, the cinematography is becoming more standard TV style. But still watchable.However season 5 loses everything that made this show great - the writing style is totally different than before, the pulse is gone, the dialogues are often weak. The music shifts to a totally depressive wailing style of mournful misery. Political propaganda is also shoved into the plot (along with a completely no-personality badguy in the form of real historic Fascist Mosely)
Season 6 is simply unwatchable. Had the series begun like this it would have been cancelled after 3 episodes...
Dark and gloomy, zero style in the horrible music and camera work, bad, weak dialogue - so bad in fact that long silent ugly dark ""sequences"" are used to kill time.The remaining actors are still brilliant, but what can even Cillian Murphy do with such weak material? It feels like his scripts are just filled by the sentence ""long brooding look"". No logic, depressing, no artistic value. A stark contrast to the firey, brilliant and inspiring seasons at the start.I just wonder how a show can spiral down like this? Who left, and who came in to mess it up?"
tt2442560,"If you like Victorian crime shows like Ripper Street, Whitechapel, Sherlock Holmes etc. then you will love this. There are two differences which make Peaky Blinders stand out. The first is it isn't set in London. Why is this a good thing? It's a nice change of scene, change of accent and culture. Peaky Blinders give you a great sense of what Birmingham was like at the time. The second reason it stands out is it is told from the criminals point of view. You get a feeling of belonging to the Peaky Blinders and despite all the terrible acts they carry out there is a fundamental decency somewhere deep down in Thomas Shelby.The cinematography is great, the storyline is great the only thing I would challenge is the accents. They sway in and out of the Birmingham accent but its a decent attempt and probably unnoticeable to anyone not from Birmingham. I've heard that they didn't want the accents too strong because it will be airing in the US. Anyhow...I'm loving it!"
tt2442560,"Peaky Blinders is one of the most unique British dramas ever made. I would even go as far as to say TV history in the making. Negative critics of the show seem to have overlooked the fact that this is the first time ever that this side of British gangster-lore has been documented. Off hand, the only thing that comes close to this style of gangland depiction is the first half of Once Upon A Time in America, were we see the heroes struggling to escape the deprivation of ghetto life. This is where Peaky Blinders stands out from the typical run-of- the-mill crime show. There is nothing glamorous about being a gangster in this world. As far from LA Confidential glitz as you can get, the viewer is forced to get down and dirty in the horseshite-ridden streets of post WW1, working-class Birmingham. The attention to detail, the costumes, the sets, particularly the Lee family dwellings, have all been created to the highest standard. As is the quality of acting, which is undeniably as good as you'll find in any prime-time British drama.Even though people on this particular forum have not had much positive feedback about the series, believe me, the connoisseurs of this genre have been very impressed thus far. Furthermore, the show seems to be building up to climatic ending rather than simply documenting a day in the life of a Peaky Blinder. The more observant viewers will see subtle 'tie-ins' between each situation and be able to follow the flow of events without obvious prediction. This is what the drama audience thrives on to stimulate analytical debate after each episode.If it doesn't get rave reviews, I will be disappointed but not surprised, as Peaky Blinders has all the makings of an artistic and timeless cult series, possibly appealing more to purists and true fans of the cult/gangster genre. Well done BBC."
tt2442560,"Peaky Blinders is all style and no substance. Endless slow-motion shots to dramatic music of characters walking, smoking cigarettes, or squinting into the distance. The priority is clearly to make everyone look cool: cool when they're engaging in brutal violence, cool when they're suffering or dying, cool when they're eating breakfast. Every shot is either like a music video or a fashion magazine spread in period costume. The characters are props - lifeless mannequins. None of them feel like actual people, nor are they meant to. The actors here are all good, but they have nothing to do but pose. We're just supposed to be dazzled by how cool they look and sound. The fact that so many viewers seem to think this show is gritty and realistic is a depressing commentary on how on we as a society can no longer tell the difference between the fake and the authentic (and how little we care about the difference). This show and others of its ilk (like the even more popular Taboo) are just nihilism photoshopped to look sexy. Superficially seductive, empty at the core."
tt2442560,"Incredibly well made show top to bottom, Every character has their own complex personalities and layers throughout, Each one masterfully performed to the absolute highest degree. Every single scene in peaky blinders is crafted to be as good as possible thanks to the incredible writing and direction of Steven knight. Of course the main stars of the show are the cast, Thomas shelby (Portrayed by the Extraordinary Cillian murphy) has to be one of if not the best protagonist i have ever seen for a tv show. Cillian murphy truly puts on a performance of a lifetime as tommy shelby, a performance so well I truly cannot do it justice by writing this review. Not to mention the other all-star performances of the rest of the cast, Paul anderson as Arthur Shelby, Helen Mccroy (RIP) as Polly Grey, Sophie rundle as Ada, and Tom hardy as Alfie solomons (one of my favorite characters second to tommy shelby himself). The Cinematography and set pieces aswell are by far the BEST i have ever seen in any show by a country mile. Peaky blinders truly is a masterful show, written and acted to absolute perfection, Should be considered as a top 5 show of all time by everybody who loves television."
tt2442560,"I for one am a huge fan of this compelling series. A wonderful dark industrial landscape, great soundtrack, rich characters that have real depth played by quality actors, all to the tune of a great script and an interesting time line. You an clearly see the similarities with the high quality US series and they have gone for this market and there is clearly lots here that could make it a fantastic long running series.Sadly, I am concerned that the BBC won't be able to retain the quality levels and we won't see it evolve in the way that the sopranos (yes I compare this show to the sopranos and boardwalk empire) evolved. Please push this internationally, let's keep it on our screens and see it develop. This period in UK history is rich with trauma, upheaval and change, the backdrop of industrial Birmingham is new and trumps the well trodden New York, Chicago, and London gangster scenes. For writers and producers this represents very fertile ground and allows innovative story lines to emerge.Keep peaky blinders on our screens..... The campaign starts here!"
tt2707408,Narcos is such a great show it's hard to explain just how good it really is. Wagner Moura and Pedro Pescal lead an amazing cast who suck you right into the show. There have been a lot of shows about drug cartels but this is without a doubt the best and it's bit close! It really is addicting once you start watching and you get used the subtitles pretty quick.
tt2707408,"Narcos is just a flat out great show. Its just so gritty and realistic. It's about the rise and fall of one of the most notorious drug lords, Pablo Escobar. It also follows other drug cartels throughout the years and how they do business. It's about real life events which they execute almost perfectly. Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar especially is just incredible. He resembles Pablo Escobar as good as any actor has ever tried. Almost half the show is in Spanish but you get used the subtitles and forget about them pretty quickly. Once you start watching this you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible. It's that good!"
tt2707408,"As a native Colombian, born and raised in Medellin (in 1975) and victim myself of the Pablo Escobar era, I must say that I am pleasantly surprised with the show!!! I thought it was going to be another bad gringo movie about Colombia with lots of mistakes and not even Colombian landscapes in the background but, I WAS WRONG!!!! Very good actors too, I didn't like Escobar accent since it's not real Paisa accent but it's OK; it will go unnoticed to non- native Colombians ;)Good Job Netflix!!

tt2707408,"Incidentally, I saw an ad for Narco on YouTube, and instead of skipping the ads like I normally do, I played this one out because I was genuinely excited for what I was watching. Instantly I jumped onto Netflix and I was not disappointed. This is a truly gripping show, one of the best I've seen this year. The characters and acting are done well and the storyline moves at a fast enough pace to get your adrenalin pumping for the whole episode. My only fear was that it would be too generic of a Crime drama, but those feelings were quickly swept away. This is truly an original and thoroughly planned out TV show with a whole lot of heart. Maybe the best on Netflix at the moment. Narco doesn't disappoint with any aspect of the show. It's exciting and fast paced, but above all, it makes you want to keep coming back for more."
tt2707408,"Narcos is an intriguing and entertaining series. Netflix again done a very good job. Season 1 tells the true story of notorious drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, who became a billionaire through the production and distribution of cocaine, while also focusing on Escobar's interactions with drug lords. This is a massive story.Escobar's life has attracted my attention too. I watched many videos and read books about Escobar's life. The show educates you on the Medellin Cartel and it is a very interesting topic to learn about. Pablo Escobar had much more influence on the political system than i would expected. This series has added a lot to me about it. Wagner Moura is an excellent actor and he learned Spanish just for the Pablo Escobar's role. He was born for this role. The bilingual dialogue adds a new layer of authenticity to the project and shows it's commitment with the original story. The long and often complicated story of Pablo Escobar is portrayed simple and effective for viewers not to get lost in what is going on.Congrats to Netflix for such a powerful, incredible production. I would recommend this show to all my friends and anyone looking for a great show to watch. This is one of the best shows I've seen in a while. Can't wait for the next season to come out! 10/10"
tt2707408,"This is such a quality production. Its cinema quality in every aspect. I've seen two episodes so far but if this show keep this up I give it an even higher grade. Netflix is now really starting to compete with HBO and this is much better than Netflix anchor House of Cards for example. Now I don't like shows that glorify and make the criminals heroes, but I don't think this series does that. Escobar is a ruthless person but still his a family man in some ways. Whats good with Narcos is that it portrays both side of the law. If it would only show it from Pablos perspective it wouldn't be as interesting. This is a very classy production. Everything from the DEA-detective who is the narrative voice to the quality of the camera work. The actors are spot on and the scenes are amazing. I nearly feel that I'm in the Colombian jungle and the hot humid air touches me through the screen. I just love series nowadays. You can transport you self to nearly every situation of life and follow character for a long time. And they really use the advantages of series if you compare it to film."
tt2707408,"It's beautiful , this's the way TV-series should be directed and produced, i loved the fast pace of the series from the first minute till now i haven't skipped anything or felt bored.The narration way of the story from the first beginning adds another depth to the story. It shows you scenes from the future then gets to the present to elaborate how we reached that point .The cast is great , probably you haven't seen anyone of them before , but sure as hell they can act , they are able to deliver the feeling they have so you can interact with them .Simply , a masterpiece .P.S : Netflix has always been picky about its series, that''s why it's my favorite network."
tt2707408,"Alright so, when it comes to drug related TV Shows which almost always include the DEA, the first thing that comes to mind is Breaking Bad and The Wire.Needless to say, while preparing to start up the pilot, I continuously tried to imagine how can this series give us something original or even something that will make us say ""Hey, this isn't a cheap knock off of something."" Well. I was profoundly surprised. Netflix has done it again.They managed to present the show in a way that includes every positive aspect of the two aforementioned series. It has the darkness of Breaking Bad, the intensity and the smart writing while also maintaining the thoroughness of The Wire in the sense that we get to see both sides of the drug trade, the clichés and even the everyday life that surrounds it.The narrative style also gives it a different aspect which helps the viewer engage in a more positive way. The cast seems to be very specifically chosen since the roles don't even make you question the legitimacy of the actors. I would say that this looks promising although I am yet to finish the series to be able to give my final word. Definitely a series you should watch if you are into this kind of thing.Kudos again, Netflix."
tt2707408,"Since movies have become nothing but shoot-em-ups and comic books television has emerged as the way to get great drama to adults.Narcos is a tale that everyone knows today, but the storytelling of this series is done with great visuals, interesting casting and a storytelling format which I love.Using the protagonist as the voice over narrator gives this series the feel of Goodfellas or Casino (two of my favourite movies by the way).Its extremely watchable and kept my attention the whole time. The scene with Pablo Escobar on the bridge was stunning.A worthwhile watch, if you have interests in things other than comic books."
tt2707408,Binged all 3 seasons and Mexico in 2 weeks. It's so good you just can't stop watching!
tt2707408,"'Narcos' tells the extraordinary story of Pablo Escobar, a Columbian who rose to the top of a massive drug smuggling enterprise. The series has been highly praised, but I didn't like it that much. Told from the perspective of U.S. government agents, it paints a picture where those agents are tough as hell but essentially heroic, and there's relatively little interest in the everyday lives of ordinary Columbians (or indeed, of Americans addicted to the drugs Escobar smuggled). Whereas series like 'The Wire' have shown us drug barons who, while grotesque, remain human, 'Narcos' is more about spectacle, and a story whose morality is fundamentally black and white. The details of Escobar's tale are amazing; but I didn't feel I got much in the way of deep insight by watching this show."
tt2707408,"The Topic of Pablo Escobar is one i would consider highly interesting, but the way its executed here just isnt.
Production value is top, sets, effects and so on, they all fit perfectly together, but thats not all a series needs.
The problems I have with this series is, that I have nothing and no one to care about.
The american cop coming to colombia with his wife doesnt really connect with me. There are so many interesting parts that get brushed over, he builds his whole gigantic drug empire practically in one episode and yet they feel hollow. I would like to see how Pablo was before, how his persona changes (because everyone earning that much all of a sudden changes), how the people arround him deal with the changes, his friends his family. When we see them all for the first time, they were already in on it. The same could be said about the DEA agents. We get a few lines of narations how it was before and how it was after Pablo took power and suddenly hes already travelling to colombia.
In my opinion there are two ways to make this more interesting:make a documentary out of it, the things the narator says, the insane riches and the high number of casualties are both shocking and fascinating, but they get padded with crap I dont care about. By that I mostly mean the DEAs work, I mean theres no mystery, no chase not anything. They´re just tracking down little flies in the opperation and when they get them, they are already dead. Furthermore you already know how the story ends, so the other way this could get me on board would be the polar opposite of a documentary:Get closer to specific people, weather they are in the DEA, the local police departments or within Pablos operation. People we care about, interesting characters, show their traits, weaknesses hobbies and business. This would be slow and a lot of things would be fictional, but I find the way the series is told right now to be painfully boring and Im really not someone who needs a lot of action.I know this is a ridiculously high standard, but lets compare this with breaking bad (actually the rating is pretty close to BB). Each episode has a lot less things happening, but because of that, we can focus on them and because we get to love and hate the characters and explore them, just like they explore themselves, we are getting engaged in whats happening to them, everything has more of an impact. We keep asking ourselves, how far will he/she go? In Narcos we get Pablo ordering street shootings in the first few episodes and whats worse for me: you dont even see or hear him doing it (Oh yea, the cop also shoots people in the first few episodes, but after he has 1 minute of sadness coming home from work, its almost like it never happened). You dont see the expression in his face when he has to make these decision, not even see him plotting or anything. For me all of these characters end up feeling hollow and more like plot-devices instead of people. Also, they die within a few episodes anyway, so why should we care?Judging from the marvellous reviews I dont have much company thinking like that. While I even have a few friends who binge-watched this thing, I had to force myself watching this after the second episode was over, but eventually gave up towrds the end ofseason 1."
tt2707408,"This Netflix series charts the rise and fall of the Colombian drug lords as their power increases as they earn billions of US dollars supplying the United States with cocaine and the actions of the DEA as they try to bring them to justice. The first two seasons are centred on Pablo Escobar and his Medellin cartel and DEA Agents Steve Murphy and Javier Peña while the third sees Peña leading the hunt for the 'Gentlemen of Cali', the cartel which eventually took over from Escobar.The story shown is based on reality but the makers never pretend that it is entirely true... a pre-title card informs us that some characters are entirely fictional. That doesn't stop it feeling real thanks to the way events are depicted. The characters are shown in a matter of fact way leaving it to the viewer to judge them... of course given what we see some of them do it isn't hard to condemn many of them. Even so surprisingly few characters are totally unsympathetic at all times. The cast does a really impressive job bringing their characters to life; most obviously Pedro Pascal as Javier Peña and Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar. Many people have commented about incorrect accents but I doubt this will be a problem for non-Spanish speakers; it was certainly better than having all characters speaking English. Overall I found the series really gripping; I'll certainly be watching 'Narcos: Mexico' soon."
tt2707408,"Loved it from start to finish. I did not care that I spent most of the time reading English subtitles, this entire series left me wanting and wishing I could speak Spanish. It's simply superb! Not once was I bored, I did not want this to finish, I knew nothing about Pablo's life, but man, what a life he lived. You have to see this to believe it!"
tt2707408,"Having seen all Padilha movies, I was anxious to see this new Netflix series and had great expectations. He did it again. I cannot stop watching. One episode after another. OK if the cast is not Colombian. But they are all good actors and play the parts very well. I will try to finish this weekend all the episodes but i think there will be more seasons. Best series of the year so far. The action is great. The scenarios are perfect. The 1980's atmosphere is awesome. 10 out 0f 10. I hope they will make more series like that in the future. Good real stories and perfect action and direction. I could not expect less from Padilha."
tt2707408,"Now, with the knowledge that most of the events shown are fictional and some real events altered for dramatic effect, I appreciate what the show set out to do.The antagonist is written in such a way that you feel sympathy for the worst of the worst, an evil cruel monster. Only good writing can do that. I admit though, this wouldn't have been as impactful if not for the phenomenal supporting cast!In terms of Audio, Visuals, Acting, this Series is one of the best.Just remember, that this Series is not a documentary, so if you want facts you should research it yourself, the antagonist's real life counterpart was far, far more evil than depicted.All in all, it's a good watch that shows how sickening mankind can be when Hope is lost. But at the same time, that there will always be those who will stand against Evil."
tt2707408,"Such a great show! Though the topic of drugs and the war on drugs is so ""easy"", it can still be appropriated to screen so poorly. I found Narcos akin to The Wire in terms of doing honor to the subject matter in a multi-layered way.It's a gritty show and unlike The Wire, it's more true crime/fact-based. The show gives fascinating insights into the inner workings of drug/crime syndicates and the level of risk people will take to transport them across borders and into other countries. It tells of the brutality of drug lords and the lengths they'll go to make profit. The acting, cinematography and script are first class."
tt2707408,"Narcos is definitely one of my favorite series.The series may not be for many because you have to read subtitles almost non-stop, but Wagner Moura in the role of Pablo Escobar is VERY convincing in my opinion.The series does a very good job of telling Escobar's story from his point of view.Steve Murphy is also very well portrayed and as such serves as the viewer's companion through the series.I stopped watching after the second season, because I didn't saw a sense in watching further at this point, but many people told me that the series went downhill after this point, so I guess I made the right decision here."
tt2707408,"(Reviewed after Season 3).The history of the Colombian drug cartels, and the US DEA's efforts to bring them to justice. Seasons 1 and 2 focus on the Medellin Cartel and its infamous leader, Pablo Escobar. Season 3 centres on the successor to the Medellin Cartel, the Cali Cartel.Superb. Edifying, enthralling and incredibly engaging - compelling viewing. A good mix of history, drama, action and intrigue. Well-drawn and developed characters - even the bad guys have character depth.Shows well the mountain of a task that faced the DEA in bringing Colombia's cocaine manufacturers to justice, as even the local police and politicians couldn't be trusted.Adding to the authenticity is that about 80% of the dialogue is in Spanish. No Colombians speaking English to each other in a Spanish accent. (There are English sub-titles, of course, should you want them).Brilliant performance by Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar. He absolutely inhabits the role, making Escobar seem like an average guy, complete with personal mannerisms and traits. Makes for a very engaging and empathetic experience. If it wasn't for the fact that Escobar was a mass-murderer, he might even be likeable... (Interesting fact: Moura is Brazilian and had to learn Spanish for the role. Makes me even more impressed with his performance and work-ethic).The negative aspect to Seasons 1 and 2 was the character of DEA agent Steve Murphy, played by Boyd Holbrook. He did not seem that an important enough character to be the narrator and essentially central figure of Seasons 1 and 2. Moreover, he is a tad irritating and Holbrook's performance involves talking low and slurred, which is how actors talk nowadays when they want to try to win awards, probably because they think people might mistake them for Marlon Brando.Pedro Pascal (who might be familiar to Game of Thrones viewers, as he played Oberyn Martell in Season 4) puts in a solid performance as Agent Javier Pena. His character grows in importance as the series progresses and he really steps up as the progression occurs. In Season 3 he takes over narration and does a much better job than Boyd Holbrook.On that note, I was a bit apprehensive about Season 3. When the Pablo Escobar story ended, I felt that this was a natural end to the series. Everything had been building up to Escobar's demise and by the time it came, I was drained, the build-up of tension was so great. Plus Wagner Moura had made him into such a larger-than-life and engaging character, replacing that character would be difficult.However, the writers do a great job in Season 3 of maintaining the engagement, through showing several characters, good, bad and neutral, and how the events affect them, plus making the plot development incredibly nail-biting.Fantastic series."
tt2707408,"There are very few series that deserve to be considered great. This could well be up there.It's based on the true story of Pablo Escobar. I don't know how accurate it really is, but at the very least it FEELS 100% accurate.The series hasn't gone down the English with columbian accents route, they have used Spanish with subtitles. For me it just adds to the authenticity of the series! Pablo's part is played effortlessly by the Brazillian actor Wagner Moura. He seems born to play the part! It has gone down the scorsese / goodfellas narrative approach. So if you don't like that style, you will be disappointed! If you are looking for a well researched authentic look into the life and deeds of the most notorious of the columbian drug lords - THIS IS IT! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! (It get's a 9 because NO series can ever be perfect!)"
tt2707408,"In general, Narcos the series is an underachiever.My biggest complaint is with the writing. To start, the whole script seems a little too favorable to the DEA. I routinely found myself questioning the prominence of the U.S. characters. At times it felt as if the story had been transcribed from DEA case files rather than actually being ""written"". This results in a sort of ""pseudo documentary"" crime drama. I can imagine the same effect if one very long episode of COPS were made with slightly higher production value. I just don't remember any real investigation or character development in the viewing experience. Just being served a series of events as seen by the DEA.The casting stuck me as questionable too. Except for the CIA agent, there were no memorable scenes or performances really. I found the portrayal of Pablo to be mostly uninspired or ""matter of fact"" (as most of the other characters). I developed an especially strong distaste for the performance of the DEA agent. THE MOST inappropriate casting choice, I really COULD NOT believe in this character for even one minute of the entire series. I don't know if the actor is a talented fellow or not. I am sure he is NOT suitable for THIS particular part. To be fair, I doubt any actor could overcome the weakness of the script, regardless of how much talent they possess.So... what I viewed was a series of skewed perspective, filled with cardboard characters. Why has it been been voted so highly? Maybe it can be explained by the fact that Pablo Escobar is one fascinating character, even when he is presented poorly in a series like this one?Anyway, I know that I'm more interested than ever in Escobar now. I will be seeking out the alternate titles that other reviewers have referenced for us."
tt2707408,"Netflix's new series Narcos is, like its central character, ambitious in scope. It attempts to capture not just the essence of Pablo Escobar (Wagner Moura), a man whose deeds and very existence still loom large in Colombia, but the socio-political landscape of the time, the fear instilled in his enemies and the geo-political effect on North/South American relations in the 1980's. It fails, not because it doesn't try hard enough to achieve the virtually impossible, but because it gets bogged down in tired narrative and muddy history. Told through the unnecessarily heavy-handed, pulp noir narration of DEA agent Steve Murphy (Boyd Holbrook, whose one-dimensional & totally unsympathetic performance drags the whole production down), Narcos chugs along well enough for a few episodes. It looks very pretty, is superbly designed and its sprawling story leaves you feeling that the team behind it was aiming for a quasi-impressionistic piece, that had to be stitched back together with Murphy's tiresome voice over.Most disappointingly, too much liberty is taken messing with the actual sequence of events. In the two hour traffic of biopic/historical features, it's understandable that licence is taken with chronology. But in a ten episode season, one should reasonably expect a little more accuracy. Narcos suffers from the needless conceit of placing actual events randomly, rather than staying true to the arc of history as it relates to the rise & fall of the Medellin cartel.The longer format also lends itself to the development of more sympathetic characters. Sadly, the only character the creators have ladled sympathy on is Moura's well-tempered Escobar. All that said, should Netflix decide to pick up a second season of Narcos, I'll almost definitely see it through."
tt4574334,"Stranger Things absolutely lives up to all the hype! This worldwide phenomenon has been one of the most talked about shows since it came out back in 2016 and for good reason...it's terrific! It's an absolute blast to watch and will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. This has everything a show needs to be great...action, comedy, drama, suspense, even nostalgia with this show. You really come to care for these characters and what happens to them. Obviously, season 1 was the best but the others are not far off. All are absolutely worth watching and I can't wait for the new season! Season 5 of s going to be its last so hopefully it goes out as good as it started. I can't wait!"
tt4574334,"I am one of those people that was put of by the thought that this was a kid's drama, from the advertising you'd swear this was aimed at a 4 o'clock after school transmission time, the reality is far from that. It's quite intense drama, thoroughly absorbing, the kind of show you can't help but binge watch. As someone that grew up in the Eighties, I can appreciate the detail that's gone into the production, it's like they slipped back and filmed it live, it is incredibly well made. I utterly love the music, it is so fitting, takes me back to wonderful eighties shows. Quality in both season one and two, I like the build up and tension that is abundant in the first. It's like the Goonies meets The Quatermass Experiment."
tt4574334,"There is no reason, in terms of story, for Stranger Things to take place in the '80s. But the '80s atmosphere - the dial phones, the chain smoking, Winona Ryder - are there to clue you in on the inspiration for this movie, which is pretty much every supernatural movie from the 80s with a focus on kids. E.T., Poltergeist, that sort of thing.The wondrous thing is how dead-on this tribute. It's not just the clothes and hair, but the style of acting, the scripting approach, the structure, all hold true to their inspiration. You've got the young nerdy kids, the horny, unsure teenagers, the monster, the mysterious one with the power, the bad science/government people, the conflicted investigator, the tearful mom.You could argue that this entire season is simply a pastiche made up of recycled elements, and I wouldn't disagree, but it really feels less like a copy and more like something of that era, as though the writers had fallen into a coma in 1985, woke up and got to working.While it doesn't have the high style of the Spielberg films that are a primary influence, it does have the likability. The story is consistently engaging and fun, the acting is excellent, and the movie has sufficient laughs and tears to satisfy."
tt4574334,"Stranger Things is absolutely as good as everyone says it is. When a show is as talked about about as much as this one has been it's hard to live up to expectations. Stranger Things has not only met those expectations but has surpassed them in every way. This is the show that our Netflix on the map as far as original shows go as this was not only one of their first but their biggest. As much as I love this show it's probably time for it for end and it is. This upcoming season is going to be the last. We have literally watched this cast grow up, they were children when this show first started and now they're all in their 20's. I can't wait for this last season and going to miss it when it's gone!"
tt4574334,"There were two dominating forces in the eighties that had a lasting effect on my cinematic taste for ever after and also resulted in my undying love for fantasy, sci-fi and horror stories: Steven Spielberg and Stephen King. I guess it isn't an overstatement to say ""The Two Steves"" probably influenced and shaped the imagination - the dreams AND the nightmares - of an entire generation.The main factor why I loved their movies and books was that kids roughly my own age figured so prominently in many of them. King wrote 'Firestarter', 'It' and 'Stand By Me', and Spielberg either directed or produced (via his company Amblin) 'E.T.', 'The Goonies' and 'Gremlins'. Those were stories where the young protagonists encountered aliens and monsters or where they themselves had supernatural powers - or where they just went on an adventure (to find a body or a long lost treasure) with grown-ups largely out of the picture. Now if you've seen 'Stranger Things', that should sound pretty familiar, right?Of course it does: because 'Stranger Things' deliberately pays homage to all those stories - and it does it very, very well. And it's not a rip-off, it's a love letter. The show emulates the themes and a certain style from those eighties treasures, and while it is a (for me) very welcome callback to some of the favorite stories from my youth, it's also very much its own thing. I won't give away the plot here (I guess you get a pretty good picture what it's about from what I wrote above), but I would like to mention that it's beautifully shot, the effects and generally the production values are top-notch, and the period-inspired music is fantastic. The biggest shout-out, however, has to go to the ensemble of actors, especially the kids who play the protagonists: their charming performances are the key to why the show works as well as it does.To sum it all up: If you're an eighties kid like me, this show is a must. For everyone else, it might depend a bit more on whether you're a genre fan or not, but if you do like supernatural stories, 'Stranger Things' is a treat. I'd rate it eight stars out of ten, but with an extra star for nostalgia, that's a 9.Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"
tt4574334,"I wasn't expecting this nostalgic TV show could be this good. In my opinion technical details in first season was not that charming but not only storyline that gets stranger, also all the technical details getting stranger.I know first three seasons were quite the same in some ways. But the Season Four explains that situations. Not all minor things, but explains the major questions.There is some great references to The Thing, E. T., D&D, Middle-earth and even more. That references makes ithe TV Show more exciting. Especially for geeks.Film Editing was perfect even from the first season.Cinematography, VFX and Sound is got better in the second season. They were a bit weak at first season.Makeup, Costume Design, Scores, Art Direction & Set Decoration were quite good from the first season, they get a bit better along the seasons."
tt4574334,"Season after season, this always leaves me feeling amazed, exhilarated and fully satisfied. There is an element of familiarity, even cliche, about the stories involving aliens, monsters, lab experiments, orphans and family relationships, yet the way they are presented is both nostalgic and magical.It's definitely one of the best series on Netflix."
tt4574334,"It can hook you immediately, everything seems fitting , the setting , the acting , the direction. Just as it should be. Bringing out the perfect blend of 1980s nostalgia. It gives mixture of taste of big 80's movies.You immediately get hooked with the story , which is amazing because it takes time for me to get invested in a story. I have been a fan of David Harbour Since the Newsroom , and he is just amazing. You're scared , Intrigued , you're completely invested. With perfect setting.I am really looking forward to where this goes from here on in."
tt4574334,"Awesome characters, great story, great balance between drama and action, love the humour in the series.... In my opinion it is a must watch."
tt4574334,"Season 4 deliver on everything I hoped to see, even though the gruesomeness is sometimes a bit much. I love the old school vibe, characters
and character development these guys go through!! Greatest series I have ever watched !!!!"
tt4574334,"I just finished the last episode of season 4 and that was QUITE THE EXPERIENCE, I was shocked by how long the episode was but every second of it was entertaining. Season 3 was personally my favorite because I think that season had the most comedic scenes, and it just felt very vibrant in general. I LOVED HOPPER AND JOYCE and I'm so excited to see them in future seasons as well. So excited for season 5!!"
tt4574334,"I don't know what happened but this is a different show, it's almost a comedy now. Everything about it feels off, the pacing, the directing, the dialogue and writing, even the characters are almost caricatured versions of themselves. Only fitting that My Bologna by Weird Al played in the second episode.First two seasons were great, S3 is a parody of those two."
tt4574334,"Season 1 was pretty good. Season 2 regular OK. But they ruined everything on 3rd season turning it into a childish sunday afternoon movie, full of cliches, sketchy BD-like villans and failed attempts to make comedy wich ended up destroying all the great misterious atmosphere of the 1st season. It's a shame."
tt4574334,"Stranger Things is the newest foray into Netflix's original programming, of which brings us their most impressive- and strange- production to date. When a young boy named Will Byers goes missing, his friends, mother and the town are thrust into a conspiracy involving a mysterious girl named Eleven and something even more sinister hiding in the woods of Hawkins, Indiana.From the get-go, you can tell this is an homage to classic '80s Spielberg, drawing on E.T. and Close Encounters, as well as JJ Abrams' Super 8. But, as the show progresses, it becomes more and more like a twisted Stephen King story set in a Spielberg movie. It becomes a dark and twisted ride into an even darker and more disturbing world where the stakes feel higher than anything before it.I can't go into great detail because spoiling even just a bit of the story takes away from the greater mystery, but I can say, it's one of the most thrilling and intense series to be on TV, without being on TV. If it were to continue, they have to pull the same punches they did with the first season, because they took a great many clichés, and somehow made them fresh and surprising, save for just a couple that they purposefully left cliché."
tt4574334,Stranger Things as a whole is one of the best shows I have seen so far. First three seasons have been exciting and stunning but season 4 is extraordinary 👌🏻. The Duffer Brothers knock it out of the park for what I believe that this series is one of the best netflix series so far. There are so many twists and turns and it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. This is one of the most addicting series that I have ever watched. I love the characters so much! The storylines and characters are so fleshed out and watching it gets me emotional and millies acting is superb. Can't wait for season 5.From me 10/10 rating for this masterpiece❤.
tt4574334,"With its amazing 80s atmosphere and creepy X-files meets E.T feel this show is set to impress. Within its first 8 minutes of run time I could tell I had found something special here in Stranger Things. Its intriguing story gives information at a great pace and I never felt myself getting confused of bored and there were enough twists or turns to keep me interested. This also had some rather great horror sequences and their use of lights flickering while yes a common trope fit so well in to the story I was on the edge of my seat every time the crackle of electricity shot through my speakers and the lights flickered. The characters of the show are the true stars here, I loved every single one of them. They were all great with amazingly interesting flaws and the way they mix and clash with one another was fun to see unfold. They certainly help to carry this show although I would say that the government antagonists of the show felt a little flat and under developed and not nearly as memorable. Production values are also quite good with some beautiful cinematography, editing, lighting and sound. My goodness I loved their music choices. I would say that the CGI does look a little obvious and from time to time I did notice some issues where the scenes didn't look quite up to scratch. I do think however I've been spoiled for visual quality since Game of Thrones so I would take that criticism with a grain of salt because it certainly didn't detract from the overall experience. The setting and style of everything in the locations where also great to see and felt real and interesting. The way everything was shot also captures every moment expertly and really helps to draw out those story moments with greater emotion. Stranger Things is one of those special shows that I stumbled across and after the opening I knew I was hooked. Its exciting dark tale is expertly woven through its 8 episode run time and I know I will be back to re-watch this one. The ending is fairly well rapped up with a few loose story threads left hanging, with a promise for potential follow on seasons but the story is quite satisfyingly rapped up by the end. Memorable, exciting, dark and haunting Netflix knocks Stranger Things out of the park, 10/10."
tt4574334,"I've been trying to put my reaction to this series into cohesive sentences - even cohesive thoughts - and I just can't seem to do it. ""Stranger Things"" blended the best parts of some of the great 80's sci-fi films from ""E.T."" to ""Poltergeist"" to ""The Goonies"" to my all time favorite, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" It was simply brilliant, and brings you back to a time when you were still able to feel a sense of wonder.Though there are plenty of thrilling moments, this film does not rely on heavy CGI or jump-scares. It focuses on relationships between parents and children, best friends, and even a touch of romance. It takes you on a journey from a parent's worst nightmare to the resilience of those who rely on friends and cling to hope.Also - you'll never look at Christmas lights the same way again."
tt4574334,"I guess plenty of people have said a lot of things about all the movie and TV references this series has and how it recreates the eighties in all their faults and splendor. I will not add to that.With the release of the second season I'd simply like to advise that both seasons are very different animals. Think of it as the difference between the original Alien movie and the Aliens sequel: Whereas the first season was more about an unknown and unseen horror and the mystery behind the backstory, the second has more in-your-face action and horror laced with character development arcs which feel nice but sometimes sidetrack the series a bit.Consequently, a fan of the show should probably watch the second season as a separate work of fiction rather than a true continuation of the first season in tone and spirit. The writers move the story forward and we get a very good piece of entertainment but the new season has to be judged on its own merits.EDIT: Season 3 turned out to be a huge change in tone for the series. Maybe it's really hard keeping up the mystery if much of the ""world"" of Stranger Things already yielded many of its secrets but the overall ""feel"" of the series went into a different direction. Maybe the writers simply ran out of 80' templates to rip off. Season 1 was very much inspired by supernatural horror as in ""Poltergeist"". Season 2 took many cues from ""Creature Features"" like ""Gremlins"" or ""Aliens"". Season 3 now uses elements of 80' zombie flicks and low budget gore horror with a little bit of spy comedy mixed in (and fight scenes which feel straight out of ""Die Hard""). All those genres didn't really mix well in the 80' and this strange cocktail sure doesn't work today. That doesn't mean that Season 3 is bad. It simply relies on characters who were established in previous seasons which used very different 80' story elements and tropes. It's almost like seeing Darth Vader in an Indiana Jones movie. Both work on their own but not together.Basically, Season 3 is an all too transparent attempt to plough a fresh nostalgia field but it doesn't work in the context of previous seasons."
tt4574334,"I watched this web series 3 months ago. And I still remember the effect which it put in my mind. It has a very nice concept and story. Although it had some loopholes which were nothing as compared to the whole web series. First coming to its story it has many twists and turns and most of them were unpredictable. The pacing is slow in first 1-2 episodes of all the seasons. But then the pace increases and then keeps you hook until the end. Talking about the acting, all have acted very well especially Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard and David Harbour. The technical aspects of the web series were also good. The web series is outstanding in its emotional aspects especially when all friends unite with each other or the bond between two characters . Moreover the intro theme of the web series is also great which gives you goosebumps. The climax of all three seasons were good. There were some scenes which were somewhat illogical or did not have any explanation. But when you watch the whole web series you will not care about these small things. Overal I can say this is a must watch web series especially if you love watching sci-fi and fantasy web series because it keeps you hooked until the end when the pacing increases."
tt4574334,"That's about it. The first season was brilliant, the second one was OK, the third one was barely watchable. If they continue like this in the forth season, it'll be massive disappointment."
tt4574334,First two seasons were great and then with 3 season they ruined everything.
tt4574334,"Simply the best and most addictive series out there. Amazing characters and character development, each season has a fantastic story whilst still building on previous series.I personally love the 1980's theming.Great actors, great writers, great directors. Can't wait for the finale of season 4, I expect if it's anything like the first 7 episodes, it will be something epic."
tt5753856,This show is the best thing Netflix has done. It is an absolute masterpiece of story telling.
tt5753856,"Insanely good, every episode shocks you in ways you never thought was possible. The constant gripping revelations were so unexpected but tied the story so well together. Exceptional and convincing acting skills by the entire cast and tons of heartfelt scenes between different character dynamics. This show is the perfect epitome of a well thought out show, meticulously crafted and executed so well and overall knows where it's trying to advance it's story. This show has revolutionized time travel storytelling and is definitely one of the most smartly and consistently written shows of our time"
tt5753856,"This is quite possibly the greatest show I've ever known to exist. It's just so pure. Every scene is saturated with substance. It's actually so good that I won't binge watch it. I take in each episode (possibly without blinking) and savor each experience. I'd write more, but my mind is seriously blown."
tt5753856,"I tired to watch this with the English dub but it was just terrible. It's the only show I've ever given a chance in a foreign language and I don't regret it. If you're the kind of person who watches shows with subtitles anyways then this is for you. It just hits the spot in every way you can imagine. Amazing writing, acting, great plot, and leaves you mind blown."
tt5753856,"This feedback is currently based on the first 10 episodes of season one (still watching the series as we speak), and to be honest it made me downgrade my rating for 'Stranger Things' quite a bit. It's clear that this series is the child of a genius - everything just works. The acting is great, the cinematography is great, the soundtrack is awesome (reminds me of Klaus Schulze at times), and the story-line is mind-boggling. This series is just miles above anything that leaves Hollywood. Wish that all productions could be like this. Thanks Netflix for bringing this awesome series to me screen. Say bye-bye to public television!"
tt5753856,"Dark is a deliciously morbid research on human decisions and their interconnection in between each other and through time. This family sci-fi drama tightly stuffed with literature, philosophy, science references and focuses on such themes as determinism, Christianity, freedom of will, existentialism, quantum physics. Dark has a bit of lovecraftian vibe to it, not in terms of monsters, yet in terms of unseen evil, an existential dread, where ""the evil"" is Time itself. The show operates on a higher level of scriptwriting, there are no filler scenes let alone episodes, and details are also mega international. Everything is important because everything is connected. Get ready for a hella ride. And don't blink while you're watch it."
tt5753856,I rarely write a review but this is truly a masterpiece. Excellent storytelling without holes in the plot or weird artifacts to fill a gap. You can see how hard the writers worked to create a coherent story. Keeps you intrigued the whole time.The best part is that season 2 is as good as the first one. Take that HBO!One of the best shows I've seen in a while. Kudos Netflix and keep up the good work!
tt5753856,"The artistic production of this show is phenomenal. The cinematography and visual elements are beautiful, the score absolutely sets it's unnerving tone, and the acting is top-notch.The first season-and-a-half were absolutely gripping. The plot is complex, as everyone keeps mentioning here, but I didn't find it too hard to follow. My problem with series started to arise when the complex plot kept leading viewers further and further down a rabbit hole that ends up leading nowhere. In the arising plot holes and the twisted knots that the writers wrapped themselves up in, they then had to pull season 3 out of nowhere in order to solve the problems that the characters and plot were having. Without giving anything away, in my opinion Season 3 and it's premise adds nothing new to drive the plot forward, but is instead a regurgitation of things we already have seen. I wanted to love this series, but I ended up only loving the first Season and part of the second season. Really artistically beautiful but the writers just didn't know when to stop."
tt5753856,"To add to all other 10/10 reviews, I will tell you my personal take.This show challenged my thoughts and emotions, and not always in a pleasant way. Behind all the plot and puzzles, its themes truly makes me reflect about meaning of life and drags me to uncomfortable places. And believe it or not, it feels good. Paradox!?I would love to be on the writers room to see how they planned, wrote and executed this project. I would love to pass through the experience from the other side. Maybe I should create a time machine for it.Thanks to everyone that took the risk to allow, work and help them to bring their vison to reality. You have done a magnificent work.Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese thank you and congratulations for your masterpiece. You wrote your name in history!"
tt5753856,"Dark was extremely good in the first season when it started as a drama/ thriller with some supernatural elements. I was hooked. But it went downhill so fast in season 2 and 3. I always had the feeling the writers couldn't decide where to go and at the same time wanted too much. So it became more and more messy. It's a perfect example for shows that became victim to their own success. As the writers wanted more and more to deliver something special and unexpected, they expanded the plot of season 1 to more and more time levels and dimensions to get a mixture of butterfly effect and lost that didn't work out. As I am from Germany myself I know that it's a common thing here to exaggerate, overdo and overact in tv shows and movies. That's why most german shows are crap or become crap over time.I rate Dark a solid 9 for The first season, 4 for Season 2 and 2 for season 3."
tt5753856,"I tend to analyze things to bits and find a lot of si-fy movies/series have been dumbed-down or childish.
Dark, seasons 1&2 have been outstanding so far. Acting, directing, and cinematography are excellent. You need to follow the dialogues closely and pay attention to subtle hints/gestures.
In today's trend of fast-food approach towards everything, this is very refreshing.I highly recommend watching it."
tt5753856,"I can't agree with the reviewer before me. They are not trying to copy Stranger Things, and I don't want to go into 'copying' at all - because Stranger Things has parallels to a few games, movies and books that have been popular before it was even in the making.'Dark' is slow paced in the beginning, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is tense, the cinematography and acting is great. There is so much more depth to it than the mentioned Stranger Things. It's not bloated with special effects and didn't have a Hollywood budget. This is how TV should be. It has got a Donnie Darko feeling to it.I guess the majority of people complaining about the pace would also complain about Blade Runner 2049 or Interstellar...so please, just stick to Marvel movies. :)"
tt5753856,"Dark is Netflix's one of the best supernatural, science fiction series. The narrative is mind-bending and utterly complex, but you could see how well it has been planned and how much time has been put into the production and creation of this show.
There are various reasons that make this show a fantastic series that is bound to mess with your mind, for sure. Now, science fiction is not everyone's cup of tea, and that is understandable, but trust me Dark really takes it up a notch. And if my words still hasn't convinced you to watch it yet, I hope the following few points can.1. The Characters and Their ArcsDark has a whole lot of characters, I won't lie. And for someone who dislikes too many characters, this might pose as a bit of a challenge, but it is all worth it. None of the characters are purely saints, and that is the best part of this show. There is no good and evil, but rather a realistic fact that good and evil resides in everyone. We are all the heroes and also villains in the story, one way or the other. It is compelling to see how as viewers, you are confronted with your own initial prejudices and views about the characters, and how they change along with the progress of the show. It will make you so conflicted till the point that you're not sure who is wrong and who is right, and you'll empathise with them all, for sure. This is how the characters are crafted in the show, and it makes it very difficult to choose favourites.2. The Plotline and The WritingTrying to explain Dark's plotline will be like trying to understand whether the chicken came first or the egg. It is one of the most intricately written stories, but so well laid out and perfectly planned that it will never cease to surprise you at any point. The writers have planned everything out, and they do not miss a single detail. Easter eggs are laid out throughout the show and the whole plotline it just too clever. So clever, it will blow your mind every time.Dark is a show full of thrill, suspense, and mystery, laden with hints of the supernatural and family drama. At no point will you feel bored or underwhelmed, that is a given guarantee. The beauty of this show is that the suspense and mystery keeps you hooked right until you've finished the show, and even then, you will be craving for more; questioning, scratching your head. The twists and turns are superb and very intricately placed in the storyline. They are dramatic but not stupid. Nothing is wasted on space, story or with dialogues. In Dark, know that every single visual, every single dialogue, everything has a role to play.The storylines are connected, and no episode will leave you without questions in your mind. You will definitely want more, and when you think you've figured out the plot, the show writers will pull out another secret, another stunt that will leave you speechless for sure. It is amazing, and I cannot tell you how many times my jaw had hung open while watching this show.3. Family Dynamics and DramaIt would be wrong to leave out the drama because it surely plays a pivotal role in this show. As I've already said how exceptionally well the character arcs are, same is with the family drama too. The show brings together the individual lives of four families whose paths - futures, present, and past - intricately cross with one another, connected in a whole big loop (and by connected, I mean really connected). Questions about sacrifices and betrayal and love all come into focus as the show progresses; who's hiding what, and who's related to who. How far will you go to save your family, to save the ones you love? It is a question that repeats itself over and over, playing out as an elaborate bigger theme.Each family has their own humanly possible problems to deal with. Starting from loss and grief to battling one's sexuality and past, it deals with all the aspects in a coherent way. At its core, Dark is largely about familial relationships that span generations, about tragedies, and betrayals that shape them, about the love and hurt, ultimately bringing everything and everyone together in a very complex web. If you thought understanding the family dynamics and drama in Once Upon a Time and Game of Thrones was difficult, wait until you watch Dark.4. Time Travel, But With LogicOne of the setbacks of this show could have easily been its time travelling storyline because, let's face it, it is super hard to create a reasonable time travel story. Often than not, shows dealing with this theme has the risk of losing the logical explanation and then witness everything going haywire. But Dark surely takes this theme at its best and delivers to us a complicated show that you'll eventually understand. To put it lightly, time travel also exists in the show as a metaphor of confronting your own self, past and future, and in the way paving the way for growth (and maybe destruction too). It doesn't actually mess up with its varying range of timelines, and keeps a note of all the complexities, all the timelines, knitting everything together in a clean circle. At times, it may get difficult to understand and seem to get haphazard and it surely will be confusing, but things play out well. It is all well at the end.5. The Various Philosophical ThemesIn the midst of family drama and time travelling, Dark also has in store a whole array of philosophies to boggle your mind and keep you questioning your own beliefs, your sanity long after the show is over. Largely dealing with the question of time and human origin, the show tends to treat time in the same vicinity as that of God. To create a world without time enslaving us humans is one of the central running theme of this show, and something that it follows quite religiously. Using fantasy, it takes on a very different angle or storytelling in the television era, questioning the meaning of faith and family, blood and time. It takes into questions about fate, destiny and choices. Can you change your destiny? Can you be truly free from the clutches of time? Can you change your future? Are we really ever free of time?6. A Visual DelightApart from the brilliant lead of casts and the super confusing yet fantastic plotline, Dark is also blessed with pleasing visuals which is a definite 10/10. The creepy forest setting provides an excellent view to the storyline, adding a sense of fear and dread in the viewers. The caves too provide an atmospheric essence to the story, a pioneer of time travel that connects everything. The settings are eerie and mostly unsettling, and seem to be always announcing an impending doom. It can be agreed that the cinematography really adds a whole boost to the whole series, adding exclusively to the suspenseful storyline. It complements the show really well, and becomes one of the reasons why this show is extremely amazing to watch."
tt5753856,"Abdolutely tremendous show! Original and keeps you hooked throughout.
The characters are so complex and the acting is excellent.
One of the best shows I have seen.
Can't stop recommending it to family and friends. Love it."
tt5753856,"Sorry I can't express my feelings after watching season 2 , it's masterpiece"
tt5753856,"I feel really conflicted about this show. I thought the first season was fantastic. But, by the time the 3rd season ended, I felt thoroughly annoyed by this show.Season 1 has a really interesting, unique, and well crafted plot. The story is a little complicated, but not overly so. The 1st season was a fantastic scifi mystery story. It really sucked me. After watching the 1st episode, it was difficult to drag myself away from the TV.It was thus with high hopes that I began watching seasons 2 and 3. However, after watching them, I find myself wishing the show had been cancelled after season 1.As time goes on, the plot gets more fantastical, unrealistic, and contrived. It also gets really complex. The show introduces a huge cast of characters, and it becomes difficult to remember who everyone is. I felt like I needed a spread sheet in order to keep track of everyone.Ultimately though, I think this complexity was covering up a stupid plot. Throughout the show, there are coincidences, things that don't make sense, and characters who behave in absurd ways. I'm also not certain that the established rules of the show's scifi mechanic are always portrayed consistently.Also, the show gets ham-fistedly dramatic. Many of the characters love to give big dramatic speeches, and to give long soulful stares. Towards the end of the series, I fond myself constantly rolling my eyes.All that said, the 1st season is really good. I have a love/hate relationship with this show. I recommend that you watch the 1st season, but pretend that the 2nd and 3rd seasons don't exist."
tt5753856,"There are some wonderful things about this program:
it establishes mood convincingly: the sceneography is suitably morose, the colours muted or harsh, driving in the idea that it's all, well, Dark.the actors are fine artists, the emotions not being hammy or kitschthe situations - the secrets, the jealousies, the infidelities - are all plausibleAnd that's about it. What's exhausting is that it goes on and on and on without respite. You just lose any kind of sympathy for the characters because there are just too may versions of the same people, all with different narrative arcs. And the to-ing and fro-ing with timelines and worlds, just makes for frustration.Completely disagree with those saying this is the best thing ever - suspending disbelief is one thing; after all, you have to accept the premise/logic of the narrative as it's given. Confusion is not the same as intrigue, and the former has no place in good storytelling.The philosophical posturing is monotonous and exhausting. The script is such a let down: how many bloody times can people keep saying ""everything happens for a reason"" / ""everything has its place in time"" / ""everything repeats itself"" / ""it's a never-ending cycle"" ... omg, we get it! You can't decide whether it's destiny or free-will. But the mind-numbing repetition is plain stupid.The first season creates sufficient build-up, and from there it plateaus. I have to keep watching because I'm a sucker for punishment, and despite feeling it's not going to go anywhere I just want the damn thing to end. But after that I'd happily delete it from history if possible."
tt5753856,"THIS is the best fking tv show I've seen since true detective's first season. I can't believe how good it is. Beautiful photography, scenarios, costumes, thrilling atmospheric music (gives the chills!!), amazing performances and above everything: perfect beautifully (wunderbar!) storyline. This is the freaking example, Hollywood. You don't need lots of money and Fx to do a decent story (or in this case, a poetic masterpiece). You just have to portray it, with every resource you have: visually, musically, with dialogue (but not the only one, don't abuse it!).Every separate plot it's intrincally intertwined. It happens so smoothly it's never forced. Anything. As long as I can remember I never had a ""cringe"" moment like most shows has. In every episode i was at the edge of my seat. This is how you make a thriller, please, PLEAAAASE take a note, storywriters. I'm so sad we probably have to wait a year or more to see the possible season 2. I don't have the proper words, it's been an amazing delightful surprise to have the pleasures to see this. Also, German it's one of the most beautiful languages, I love hearing it! We have such dense Nitzschean philosophy everywhere, I could totally smell the darkness. I love this kind of stories, with time travel and meaning of life as a central subject of the story. Determinism? Free will?. Maybe this is why I loved it so much. This show never treats its public with disrespect. They tell you what you need to know when it's appropriate. I love it.Never an American production could make this dark nihilist hell. I'm glad Netflix is giving us a new cinematic adventure, never could been better. I think it's netflix' best show ever made. Yeah, not even your super loved- big fan base- stranger things does justice to this beautiful masterpiece. Not. even. close. Leave it for the children.In a word: Perfection!! I hope keep seeing this quality Netflix!"
tt7094780,"This is an epic drama loosely based on the history of Korea from the perspectives of different but engaging characters. It is set in the time where Joseon (Korea) is fought over between different countries with America and Japan. The main character is played by Byung-Hun Lee, who is a phenomenal Korean actor and opposite of his role is Tae-ri Kim who is a newer actress. Byung-Hun Lee has many years of experience and is a well known Korean actor and he has appeared in numerous American films such as G.I. Joe and R.E.D. Both the actors bring fierce intensity to their roles with their well acted scenes and show such emotion through their lines, looks and even their stares. The supporting cast is also superb as they tell their own stories in this conflicted time. All in all the drama has great production value and truly keeps you mesmerized through it's weekly episodes. If you are a fan of Korean dramas or even if you aren't familiar with them, then this is a great series that you can watch."
tt7094780,"Haven't watched such a good series in years! Every episode feels like a movie. The cinematography and visuals are stunning, the score is hauntingly beautiful, the characters are full of depth and you can't help but develop an overwhelming attachment to them. Amazing actors. This has become My favourite series of all time"
tt7094780,"Do not let the cheesy title of this series fool you. This is extraordinary from many points of view. Historically, it is based on an actual setting, something very few people in this country would know about Korea, Japan and the USA. Within that framework, the clash of cultures, where values are different and honor prevails. The aesthetics of the production are something to marvel at. And then, the characters, who behave in accordance to strict rules surely strange to us behaving in ways that are, ultimately, quite fascinating. The love relation develops strangely, slowly and far from any courtship you could ever imagine. That gets performed by the two main characters in rather fascinating fashion as well. I do not recall seeing a picture where a still face and a minimal movement could unload so much expression. Actress Tae-ri Kim packs more beauty and feeling in still silence than any actress I can recall; she deserves stardom just for such incredible skill.
I have seen five episodes, and I am mesmerized."
tt7094780,"I have been watching movies and shows for over forty years. And, yes, this show is THAT good! After watching ""Descendants of the Sun"" only a couple of years ago, I was wondering how long it would be before another grand series came about; a series that resonates with the heart and soul; a series with a crisp story and fantastic performances by the actors. And along came ""Mr. Sunshine.""I can only think of a couple of series that are on par with ""Mr. Sunshine."" ""Band of Brothers"" is one and ""Descendants of the Sun"" is another.What is truly sad is that much of the world is quite ignorant when it comes to Korean history, I'm sure. It's a country that always seems to be at odds with Japan, and sometimes China and Russia as well. Its turbulent history has too often been plagued by invasions or other countries attempting to gain control of the small peninsula.""Mr. Sunshine"" tells of the time when Korea was, once again, fighting against Japanese occupation in the beginning of the 20th century. With virtually no real army to speak of and a king with little power on the throne, Korea or ""Joseon"" found itself relying on rebel guerilla tactics to try and prevent the Japanese from a complete takeover.Several characters find themselves unknowingly intertwined with each other at the outset of the series. One boy finds himself quickly orphaned and making his way to America to begin a new life. He returns to Joseon years later as a U.S. Marine Captain. Little does he know how the turn of events would pull him into the conflict between his previous homeland and Japan.The story's focal point is on three men who all happen to have feelings for the same woman, Go Ae-shin; a woman with a background as terrible and wrought with horror as the marine captain's. And yet, she is the heart and soul of the rebel forces. It is admirable and captivating to see this woman spearhead the rebellion, as well as her willingness to do whatever it takes to help her country. Tae-Ri Kim is perfectly cast, giving Ae-shin tremendous depth and complexity to her character.The cast is simply magnificent from top to bottom. Every role, no matter how large or small, is handled with immaculate precision and depth. However, there is, to my mind, one who stands out just a hair above the rest. And that is Byung-Hun Lee as Eugene Choi, the marine captain. The man has a regal distinction that very few actors in history have been able to pull off with such ease. He may appear to be emotionless in many of his scenes, but to make such an assumption would be wholly inaccurate. I've said many times: an actor/actress who can say more with their eyes than with words, is a true master at their craft. Byung-Hun Lee is such a performer. I cannot imagine anyone else playing this part with the integrity and depth that he brings to Eugene Choi.This is quite literally a ""Do not miss!"" series. With 24 episodes, each at about 75 minutes each, you are in for a wonderful treat. This is a show to savor. One might be wishing to quickly move on to the next episode, but I found myself stepping back and letting each episode soak within me instead. Like a perfect French dessert, you relish taking your time and savoring each bite. This is such a series."
tt7094780,"I am a huge fan of Korean shows, and this one is no exception. It is a beautiful story, with just as beautiful cinematography and rich characters. As others have written, the first episode kind of goes all over the place, but it is worth sticking around, because you basically figure out who is who in the second episode."
tt7094780,"So I just finished the series. And this is the first thing I'm doing, writing this review , because it's so overwhelming.I loved the show from the beginning, but it was a little slow for my taste, but understandably because it's set in 19th century. So I dragged the first 15 episodes for around 2 weeks(I usually finish a season in couple of days), but the last 9 episodes are absolutely a blast. It picks up pace so quickly and things get in motion flawlessly. Now about the show.It's a masterpiece, storyline, plot, character development, acting , background score everything is absolutely amazing. Hats off to everyone for making something so amazing, it's definitely gonna etch a mark in the mind of viewers. Recommended to everyone, especially to those who don't watch korean dramas. I have watched more than 100 shows from different countries and regions and this is among my top 5 shows.Like I said. OVERWHELMING!!!"
tt7094780,Very enjoyable series telling the early struggle of Korea to overcome Japanese influence and occupation. As with many Korean dramas we have lots of strong characters with fascinating back stories. All 3 male leads love a Korean noble lady who is also a freedom fighter and only one can win her heart. The series is well filmed and acted and the director wrings out the emotions very well. As it should be with all good series I was very sad to finish it.
tt7094780,"Probably the people who wrote negative reviews have misunderstood the true meaning of the story. This is not a romantic TV series, this is simply a genuine hymn to the beauty and strength of the Joseon. The romantic story between the lovers is only the frame of a splendid picture depicting the Joseon of the years 1870-1920. The real protagonists are the emotions and the ardor of those who have the strength to fight for the survival of their homeland, even at the cost of their lives."
tt7094780,"The show is set in early 20th century Korea, few years away from being occupied by the Japanese Empire. The ruling Joseon dynasty has finally opened up their ports to Western powers and modernization is happening at an unprecedented pace for historically xenophobic Koreans. The setting is a playground for showmakers to flaunt the beauties of multiple cultures: Korean, Japanese, and Western. And they flaunt them masterfully, coupled with the beautiful Korean geography. For every episode I was overtaken by the aesthetics of the show.The show is also a subject of interest for history buffs. As Westerners watching the show, Korean history is probably the last thing we would be interested by. It is interesting to see how the show portrays adapting Korean people and how foreign involvements in Korea during the period played out. Also, the main character features a Korean-American Marine Corps captain. Sounds far-fetched? Surprisingly not, I have found. And, of course, the romance. I should not say too much, but I will say that the show will make you cheer for the male and female leads. In sum, this show offers no other show has to the greater international audience. I found Netflix to be quite dull when it comes to recent originals. But Netflix really outdid themselves this time around."
tt7094780,"We just got done with the first episode, and my husband and I enjoyed it immensely. The cinematography work is stunning, the battle scenes are well choreographed and realistic, and there is some great acting in this show. The story line is shaping up to be an interesting one. There is a lot going on in this first episode, and you may find yourself frustrated at first, trying to figure out the timeline and characters, as there are flash forwards and more than one story line, but it looks at least for now, that they will start merging fairly quickly. I highly recommend this show.UPDATE: We have moved through the first 5 episodes, and this show just keeps getting better and better!"
tt7094780,"Being British I struggled somewhat with the array of characters with unrecognisable names in episode 1 but I stuck with it and was hooked by the end of episode 2. Each further installment dragged me deeper into this enchanting love story set against momentous historical events.Over the years I have watched many good television series. But this is the first time I have ever finished a series and immediately watched it again.P. S. I have just watched this yet again and still find it wonderful. Contrary to less positive reviewers, for me this series is packed with incident. In particular the last half dozen episodes fly by at a thrilling pace. I suppose the first half dozen episodes proceed more sedately, focused as they are on the beautiful love story at the centre of this drama, as well as developing the sparky relationships between the 5 main characters in this ensemble piece. But it is that love story and those relationships that bring so much emotional heft to the story. As I have already said I was captivated by the end of episode 2!"
tt7094780,"Without a doubt, this is the best film (i.e., TV series) I have seen in the past five years. From a technical standpoint, it has everything; great story line & plot; directing, blocking, the acting was superb, cinematography techniques (...I was particularly impressed with the use of the camera angles including the use of the Dutch Tilt, slow-mo, top-down angles; movement through and across the frame, tracking shots and rack focusing); and the lighting; use of colors; variation in the music content; sound and visual effects. From an emotional point of view, I was continually surprised by the manner in which the audience is led into the use of symbolism as the story unfolds (great writing!). For five days, I was completely obsessed with the next episodes and the sequential development. On at least five different occasions, I was brought to tears and the finale left me exhausted emotionally. I spent the next two days, doing research on this film hoping to find something that would mention the film's success and developing my comments. Obviously, this was a big budget production and I sincerely hope that the producers and all those that had a vested interest consider this production an enormous success whether the economic return met their expectations or not. Congratulations and thank you. From an artistic perspective, this film is worthy of at least an Emmy Award - if not more. This film truly moved my heart."
tt7094780,"This show started out quite well, though it took at least 3 episodes to understand what was even going on and where the story was headed. Or where I thought it was headed. Because this show can be divided into three parts and as a whole I couldn't manage to pinpoint what the message and the purpose of this show was.The first part is about the backstory of some key figures in this show and how and why their lives evolved the way they did. This part is really sad and bloody.The second part of this show nothing much happens. The story doesn't evolve much and you feel like you're going in circles because only small incidents keep happening but the problems with Japan and all really take a backseat in this part. So I'd say this is the part where the focus is on the main couple and the key characters around them. The thing is: even the relationship of the main couple didn't evolve much, they hugged three times and that's it. Don't expect to see a kiss either. It was kind of weird to see a story about a couple that was apart a lot and skipped most of the key milestones in romantic relationships but are supposed to be the loves of each other's lives.The third and last part is all about the Japan & Korea treaty and its consequences as in Korea losing their sovereignty and the so called righteous army trying to defend their country. Not much romance here either, only lots of blood and tragic deaths.So what was the purpose of this series? I don't really know. Neither the romance part convinced me much nor the historical part because major facts of how it even came as far as the treaty and Korea losing its sovereignty weren't well explained or depicted. The show made it seem like Korea and the emperor just sat back and watched until it was already too late. A quick research told me that this show has been openly criticized for having done poor research and not explaining and the depicting the events better and after watching this show I must say I agree.The heroism of some korean citizens, mainly the righteous army, seemed bittersweet in that context because you don't really understand why it had to come this far in the first place.Also, I hated the ending and not because it was bittersweet but because the female lead got more than she deserved in my opinion and because it was unfair to all the other amazing characters who deserved way better. But watch for yourself.Like I said, the cinematography was awesome and the OST on point.
Conclusion:
Great OST and cinematography, purpose/message of the show isn't clear, story lacks historical facts and better explanations of depicted historical events and how they came to be."
tt7094780,"Positives:
Beautiful costumes and setGood acting by most main characters (with exceptions)Beautiful cinematography, although some shots were overdoneNegatives:
Zero chemistry between two main characters, Kim tae Ri and Lee Byung Hun. The main story revovles around their love story, which can't be felt at any stage of the storyStory moves waaaaay to slow. The show needed a lot more action, twists, turns and more interesting dialogues/confrontations. There was so much potential with the historical context, that hasn't been used at all.Lee Byung Hun's revenge story wrapped up too soon/handled poorly. One of the few interesting elements in the story was written so poorly. His desire for revenge just somehow fizzled out and petered out to nothingEmbarrassing acting by all English-speaking actors, plus the French actor. Never seen so many poor actors in one drama. How can you can not make an effort to cast actual actors from America/France/Great Britain. I'm sure there are lot of talented actors that don't cost a fortune. Instead, it feels like the production team just picked up random foreigners they found on the streets of Seoul.Lee Byung Hun is a miscast. He knows how to play an action character, and I believed his rage when it came to his dead parents. Everything else (romance and humour) he just doesn't seem to be able to pull it off.Unncessary love triangle/quare(?). Was that really necessary? I guess so, since it is a K dramaToo many cliche K drama scenes (excessive use of flashbacks, soundtrack, and characters just staring at each other for long periods of time while they are about to cry)Overall: With all the hype, names, and money involved, definitely a huge disappointment. Regret having watched the whole show to be honest."
tt7094780,This is the most beautifully done series I've ever seen. Each frame of each shot was like a painting. The story is your typical historical k drama but because the cinematography is so on point it becomes like a beautiful story book. It's worth binge watching over and over again.
tt7094780,"Im ABSOLUTELY loving it. The writers did an amazing job with the casting( loved everyone role)and the scripts. It was, emotional, funny, educational, exciting, passionate, just a little of it all. The cinematography was absolutely breathtaking, the slow action parts bonus. First time I ever watched a Korean series with subtitle and it won't be my last. I can't say enough, but to give a chance, and watch it, and see for yourself. Thank you for a great series and thanks to the writers and actors. Wish you many more successes."
tt7094780,"Yes, this is a romance but a wonderful non-gratuitous love story. Pact with historical themes, very interesting characters, class warfare, revenge and absolution. What I enjoyed most was the pacing of the story, it rarely gets ""stuck"". Also the cinematography was outstanding, capturing the highlights of the story and the beautiful set locations. I highly recommend listening to this in its native language because the rhythms of actors voices would be ruined by any ""dub"". Cannot say enough on how much I enjoy ""waiting"" for the weekends to get the next episodes of this show."
tt7094780,"It is an age that there are countless dramas of love storyline. Among similar TV-dramas, the one ""Mr. Sunshine"" is a very high quality TV-movie series. Especially, the great performance produced by male lead Lee Byung-hun and female lead Kim Tae-ri are one of the delights of watching this drama. Mr. Lee is already a great actor well-known to the public. On the other hand, in my case, Ms. Kim first got to know her through this drama. The reason why I wait for this drama every weekend is her presence. Her beautiful acting and her elegant voice are one of the main factors that make the drama distinguishable from countless ordinary love story movies. Of course, the power of the drama script and the ability of the director are indispensable. The period of the drama is from 1990 to 1905. Nevertheless, the love story of the two lovers is moving beyond the times."
tt7094780,"I absolutely love Mr Sunshine. After watching each episode a number of times in their entirety I find myself watching my favorite scenes over and over while I wait for the newest to be released on Saturday and Sunday. The actors, the story, the landscape, the camerawork and direction are all perfect. I'm grateful to have stumbled on to it."
tt7094780,I just started watching Korean shows. This one is so good. I could go on and on. I'm telling you to watch this because it is so damn good. Maybe Hollywood should start watching Korean shows. They like to steal ideas. Steal the idea of making a good movie.
tt7094780,"It only takes one word to describe this series, Perfection... I don't even notice the subtitles. A must watch for the entire family. Enough said."
tt7094780,"I cannot believe how incredibly rich this Korean Drama is. As others have said, the first episode seems confusing, but stick with it and it quickly falls into place. It's more profound than Shakespeare and all of the characters will become part of your heart as the show takes you through the heartbreaking and brutally cruel narrative of the Righteous Army, cultural hierarchy, friendship, love and war in Korea at the turn of the last century.
The Exquisite cinematography is captivating and powerful. So too is the directing, acting, writing, costumes and music throughout the 24 episodes. You'll be fluent in Japanese and Korean by the end."
tt7094780,"Like many tv shows it starts off with great potential but falls into the trap of trying to milk every last ounce out of it. It could easily have been done in half the time. With hours spent staring blankly at each other, whispering then wandering off, only to repeat the same scene again, and again, and again. The plot needs to be a lot more fast paced and twice the amount of action. It could have benefited from getting some better quality American actors also as the ones used may as well be made out of wood. It still has several episodes to go so could rescue itself somewhat but now I'm watching out of some sort of obligation with very few enjoyable/interesting moments each episode as it's so strung out. Repeating the same scenes in the same locations...."
tt7094780,"Photography is great as has been mentioned by other reviewers. Too much in the way artistic shots with lingering emotional framing 
result in boredom. My mind wanders and i wonder why i am still watching. I couldn't make it through the first episode. No likeable 
characters but the beastiality of man is well portrayed."
tt10554898,"I was looking for some Mandarin-language TV show to improve my Chinese, and I stumbled across the Untamed. The actors seemed okay, the scenography was cool and I started watching. However, after just a few episodes, I was so into the story. The relationships between the characters are beautiful, and the story keeps on getting more and more sad but I couldn't stop watching.
I really liked the Lan Zhan and Wei Ying relationship. The way Wei WuXian says ""Lan Zhan"" in the beginning is so enthusiastic and kind of annoying, however - at the end of the series it becomes so gentle and caring.
Ironically, the reason I started watching this TV show was just to improve my Chinese. But now I want to improve my Chinese BECAUSE of this series."
tt10554898,"From the perspective of a novel fan, ""The Untamed"" truly surpassed my expectations as the live adaptations of Mo Dao Zhushi (Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation). The synopsis: A fantasy story set in ancient China about two young idealistic paladins who found themselves entangled in a bloody rebellion against an evil clan. One became a powerful demonologist and died tragically, until a strange event reunited these two friends years later. They joined force to solve the mystery behind a series of deaths, but unexpectedly uncovered a sinister conspiracy and many startling revelations about each other.""The Untamed"" brought this fantasy world to life with visually stunning scenery and set design, outstanding soundtrack, great plot and character development, as well as a team of talented new actors (major bonus points for giving us a parade of eye candies). I was a bit turned off by the substandard CGI...but I get that it's not a big budget production and funding must had been tight after the studio caught on fire.So what made ""The Untamed"" the biggest runaway hit of 2019 in the world of Chinese television? It has a well written script with a perfect balance between comedy and drama, as well as action and intrigue. I'm also very impressed by how the screen writers managed to fill some of the original novel's plot holes and reorganize the timeline to make the story less confusing. However, it's not flawless and some episodes had issues with pacing. For example, the first two episodes were bogged down by too many subplots and flashbacks at times. The last episode also had several repetitive and out of order sequences that felt like fillers before the final scene (nevertheless it's still a pretty good finale).Here's another element that made this a truly binge-worthy series. The casting directors of ""The Untamed"" did a superb job finding two talented lead actors who also had outstanding chemistry together on screen. Xiao Zhan is the perfect embodiment of the playful, dark, and passionate Wei Wuxian. He captivated audiences from the very first scene and was the main reason that kept me going pass the first two confusing episodes. Then there's the interesting casting choice for our second lead character...It's hard to picture a vibrant 21-year-old pop artist/TV host portraying the stoic and graceful Lan Wanji, but Wang Yibo's ability to convey a plethora of emotions with few words and very subtle expressions cemented his status as an up and coming actor. It goes without saying that directors Zheng Weiwen and Chen Jialin played a huge part in these actors' remarkable performance.It's also important to mention that ""The Untamed "" has one of the most well-rounded supporting roles with their own stories and character arcs. Their relationships with the protagonists were pivotal in the story's central themes: the fine line between good versus evil and the enduring love that exists between siblings, friends, and adopted families. There were talented supporting actors who were outstanding from the start while the rest took some time to get into their characters. Nevertheless, it's a pleasure to watch these young actors bring out the best in each other as the series goes on. Although there were some comically bad villains, but the screen writers managed to redeem themselves by creating complex antagonists with motivations and perspectives tht we can all relate in real life.Overall I recommend giving ""The Untamed"" a whirl even if you are not familiar with Chinese costume drama. You'll be rewarded with a thoroughly unique and entertaining viewing experience once you get over the heavy makeup and over-the-top choreography typical of traditional martial art series. So grab a couple of your fun loving friends (group reactions and comments will be a blast, I guarantee), sit back and enjoy the 50-episode fantasy adventure that is ""The Untamed""."
tt10554898,"At first, I almost gave up after the first few episodes, but I'm so glad I gave this series a chance. Fifty episodes later, I'm still obsessing over not only the two lead characters but also the actors who embodied them. I haven't read the novel nor seen the anime version, so there were no expectations going in. I won't go into the story as so many others have already done so. I'll just provide my opinion only.The various plot lines held no big secrets--predictable and routine for a xianxia story with often long drawn scenes which didn't make sense nor push the plot through. The CGI was under par but did the job. What held it together and won me over was the ever so strong chemistry between the two leads, supported by a very talented supporting cast. The BL arc didn't hit me until I did my research. I initially interpreted it simply as brotherhood love, strong friendship and bonding between soulmates (not in the romantic sense) that has been written in so many wuxia novels that came before this one. Then after reading reviews and other info, I had to go back and rewatch episodes to pick up on what really was happening. The longing gazes, the tortured internal conflicts, the array of emotions unspoken but seen through the slightest smile or nod or simple act...these little crumbs spoke volumes if you understand what's going on. Rematching and looking for these clues were Eureka! moments for me. I actually really appreciated the fact that, due to censorship or not, the production portrayed this aspect of BL so subtlety and poetically, unlike the in-your-face presentations that would leave nothing to the imagination. Bravo! The actor who portrayed the ""ultimate villain and mastermind"" behind the plot deserved his own shout-out...his acting was at once convincing yet heartrending! The emotions in which his portrayal evoked literally gave me a vertigo spin.Here's wishing much success to the two leads in their professional and private lives!! I can't get enough of seeing them together. Don't let the haters win."
tt10554898,"I can't remember seeing tv series that afected me so much. I don't know if that is because of the different style (Chinese movies have a unique approach to the viewers) or because of the drama plot itself but it was so good.
The first few episodes I've struggled with because there was so much information I had hard time remembering and a lot of names which I couldn't remember but after a few episodes it was easier for me to watch. I think the most interesting thing about the drama were the characters and their development through the episodes. There was a hidden message behind every scene which I found absolutely fascinating. The two main leads executed their roles perfectly. I was captivated by Wang Yibo's performance as Lan Zhan. To have a few lines and to have to count on the facial expressions it's the most difficult role to play. Good job!
Abou the plot - it was interesting, it touched very powerful and meaningful themes such as family relationships, brotherhood and even love. Some the scenes in the series were one of the most romantic things I have ever watched, even though there were only hints. I found that approach very powerful.
The costumes were great, the atmosphere was like a fairytale, the OST was perfect. And yes, after 30th episode when everything started to come to place I cried a lot and I'm not a movie crier at all. Every little detail moved me and after the last episode I can't stop thinking about that drama."
tt10554898,"This drama started off slow for me but the story really came together. Just be patient as the story is unfolding. The two leading characters did an amazing job portraying their emotions. The Main character Wei Wuxian has the most beautiful smile. He is such a talented actor. I love their chemistry. There are so many twist and turn in the drama. The beautiful music really pulls at your heart strings. I cannot say enough good things about it. Clearly the world feels the same as this drama has been trending for quite some time now and have launched the two leads into super stardom. The loyalty between the two main characters is beautiful. One of the best drama I have ever watched and I have watched a lot of drama. I am completely obsessed and have been following their careers since watching it. Even after watching it so many times, I am still picking up new tidbits. Kudos to the cast and crew of The Untamed. What a masterpiece."
tt10554898,"I have just finished watching this epic on Netflix and, in short, I have to say it is well worth sticking with it, as ultimately it is hugely rewarding on so many levels. Looking at a show like this with a western sensibility, we have to talk of some elephants wandering around the room.
Firstly the era in which this drama takes place means the depiction of strong class and social positioning, showing a degree of respect and politeness rarely seen in the west, except perhaps in the 18th century. The mannerisms and dress take some getting used to. The viewer must also get used to the fact that everyone has at least two names: given name, courtesy name, and sometimes a formal name. All the major characters belong to one of five clans.
Secondly the pacing of this series is likely to be difficult for a generation with a short attention span and a video-game paced expectation. This series has many periods of long glances, involved speeches and lengthy exposition. Sometimes it's difficult to know why some characters get so upset over things that are apparently so trivial. These social orders are strict indeed.
Then we spot that there are fifty one-hour episodes, a daunting thought, but more of that later. I would advise checking out more knowledgable reviewers to gain more insight into the clans and the people in them.
I cannot speak to the original novel. I have searched but cannot locate an English translation. Much is made of the relationship between the two male leads and, by all accounts, this is much more explicit in the novel. Nonetheless it became clear to me early on that there was attraction between the two that was more than just brotherly love.
The story begins with events leading to the death of Wei Wuxian (aka Wei Ying and the Yiling Patriarch). After this we are taken on a lengthy flashback detailing the development of the friendship between Wei Wuxian, the demonic cultivator, and noble and intriguing Lan Zhan (also Lan Wangji and Lord Hanguang). We learn how Wei Wuxian is framed for misdeeds and killings he did not really do. Some years after his death Wei Wuxian is revived by illegal means, is reunited with Lan Zhan and they embark on an investigation as to who is behind all the feuding and the discredit of Wei Wuxian, although this has been hinted to the viewer already.
Many of the confusions of earlier episodes begin to get resolved; you will easily find spoilers elsewhere if you want them. Suffice to say the final half-dozen episodes reveal a great deal and the end is satisfying.
The spectacular scenery, stunning costume design and and decidedly attractive cast make this whole journey unique and exciting. I have found the animated version online and have started watching that too.
The two leading actors, Xiao Zhan as Wei Wuxian and Wang Yibo as Lan Zhan, are mega-stars, across east Asia these days and they appear together on all kinds of tv shows (see YouTube). The intensity of their performances, coupled with the nuanced nods to more than just a bromance is enjoyable and skilfully done in a climate of censorship.
I can thoroughly recommend this, although it is unlikely that many westerners will commit to a fifty episode series and that is a shame. There is much to discover about a very different society and we could all learn much from it."
tt10554898,"It's a 9 out of 10 but only because it breaks my heart due to content regulations it can be exactly like the original source. I still think they did and amazing job adapting the script to make it GP friendly. I started the series, and once I started it was really hard to stop. The acting by both main actors, really reflects the original characters, Wang Yi bo totally nailed Lang Wangji, and Xiao Zan left me speechless, he delivered."
tt10554898,"I have no idea why this came up as a recommended title for me on Netflix, but I am so glad it did. I've never shown an interest in non-English titles, let alone those in Chinese, and I almost gave it a pass. I'm now blessing my lack of impulse control. I was charmed almost immediately, even if the first two episodes left me pretty much completely lost. I was still mesmerized. Sticking with it, I was able to piece together the story, and I enjoyed it tremendously.The lavish scenery, the music, the sets and costumes create a fascinating world, but the actors are enchanting beyond belief, and they sell this story like they were born for it. They all play their characters with an earnestness that makes the heart squeeze. Seeing the two leads bond throughout the series is a joy to watch, even throughout the emotionally wrenching periods of turmoil that drive the plot and the mysteries. There is something wholly profound, almost deliriously romantic in a way, about their relationship and how it deepens and evolves.Whenever the mischievous Wei WuXian smiles, it feels like sunshine bursting from the screen. When we finally see the ridiculously stoic Lan WanJi smile, it's breathtaking for all its quiet honesty. It leaves you sorely wanting more.It's not exactly perfect, though, this series. The effects are frankly sometimes silly. But it doesn't matter, with a story this captivating. The often fast dialogue can be tough to catch via the subtitles, but you do follow the gist. One serious negative is how the story treats the women on the whole. For any other series, it would be a deal-breaker for me. But I was otherwise so completely taken by the series that I can look past that. What I love about the series outweighs the negatives so much that I have no hesitation to give it a ten. It's earned that ten from me.This series was actually more of an experience, and I intend to go through it again. I'm not ready to let go."
tt10554898,"Trust me when I say this series is the most perfect blend of fantasy, subtle romance and family drama. Everything about this series has me wanting to rewatch it more than a few times. From the actors Xiao Zhan and Wang YiBo to the cinematography, the costumes, the sets and amazing soundtracks. This series brings me so much joy to watch!Would highly recommend this series to anyone that wants to appreciate a good Chinese drama."
tt10554898,"I can say I haven't read the novel etc, but of all the dramas I've watched I can this was one of the best ones and of all of the dramas I've watching the acting was flawless. Although I was asking for more, the drama didn't end badly. Take your time and watch a few episodes or the whole season who knows you might love it!!"
tt10554898,"This is a funny Chinese TV drama leading with very promising Chinese young actors, especially Xiao Zhan and Wang Yibo.Xiao Zhan is a unprofessional actor, but he presented a very excellent performance. His role is quite hilarious and charming. I enjoyed the fantastic story and the drama.
You won't miss it if you love ancient Chinese TV series."
tt10554898,"I'll admit that I've never read the original story, or seen the animated series, so I was going into this completely blind (basically; all I knew about the series before I watched it was all the guys have long, luxurious hair and fight each other graceful with swords whilst flying through the air... Oh, that and the fact the main two characters are in love...), but I have to say it really exceeded my expectations in many aspects!I don't think I'm the only one who'll say that the first few episodes are a bit confusing to get into (especially when you're not familiar with the source material) which makes them drag just a little bit. But I'd say if you're feeling this way at the start, definitely try to stick with it! The story continues to get more interesting and intense, as well as things get explained as it goes on! And the characters all go through some really great development through the 50 episodes, which makes them more relatable!As far as complaints go; my main issue is with some of the ways scenes are filmed and framed, particularly in very emotional scenes... It wasn't necessarily bad or too jarring, but it did pull you away from the immersion a little bit! The cgi isn't the best, but that's to be expected considering this didn't have a massive budget... It wasn't too bad to pull you out of the story, though, so I'd say it wasn't too big of an issue!The biggest thing I'll commend the series on is something I imagine everyone has already said: that being the handling of the relationship between characters, particularly the main two! It's no secret that this is based on an lgbt ('bl') novel, and that China have strict censorship laws that don't allow depictions of that on screen. However, the producers and scriptwriters really were able to develop a believable and touching dynamic between the two main characters throughout the span of the series in subtle and well done ways! And more than that, the other friendships and relationships of the series were made believable and touching too!Overall; it's an emotionally invested and well made drama, with some pretty decent acting on the most part and a bunch of really engaging and interesting characters!"
tt10554898,"Where do I begin with. Its a beautiful story about Lan Zhan & Wei YIng.Though I personally liked the book version better even the ending was very well handled in the book because the drama ending felt a bit lonely. Also the story telling was well maintained the flashbacks & current story when in drama it felt a bit overwhelming to force viewers to watch the entire flashback at once. Honestly flashback sorry didn't make sense in drama.The actors were brilliant and portrayed the roles very well. Actor playing Wei Wuxian was cute & charismatic just like its character in the book & actor played Lan Wangji was brilliant with his acting skills (& cant' stress enough but he was super beautiful just how he was mentioned in the book ""A fine piece of jade""). All the other actors as well were really amazing & specially actors who played Jin Guang Yao and Xie Yang. They were brilliant.Though drama changed the story a bit and left a few open ends for which, one need to read the book. Well choreographed action sequences, but had some flaws like every time anybody who played the flute I couldn't see them putting any effort, just pouting except Zhan Xiao(he did it well), felt a bit fake.The drama definitely worth a watch & I am sure viewers won't be disappointed & I really praise all the actors again, they did a wonderful job with their acting skills. Hope to see more of their good work in future.And the OST WangXian song was simply superb. Its beyond beautiful. The singers got really beautiful voice."
tt10554898,"I told my girlfriend that this is probably the worst thing that we have watched for queer content.The acting is so-so. I thought that the actor who played Lan Zhan did a better job in the later episodes when conveying his loving looks. The actor who played Wei WuXian had to voiceover most of his work, which was distracting.The special effects and the fight scenes were atrocious. The extras were awful. Watching the extras in the fight scenes would have been entertaining if it weren't so... sad.The story itself is fine. It's quite predictable and easy to follow... to the point where the last three episodes are almost completely unnecessary. They could have condensed it to one episode, for sure.We watched it on Youtube to support the creators, but oh my god were those subtitles god awful. I could barely follow the story because the subtitles were made by some robot. I had to ask my girlfriend SEVERAL times about what the hell was going on. But that's not the fault of the show, just the fault of the subtitles.The fact that the show cycled through the same three songs and their instrumentals did not help things. One of the songs in particular (the one about his sister) is a DIRECT SPOILER. So thanks for that, show."
tt10554898,Amazing story! The entire cast was fantastic. Xiao Zhan and Wang Yibo were brilliant in their performance together. I definitely will be fangirling them both in their future dramas. Cheers for this outstanding wuxia-fantasy costume drama! Loved it!
tt10554898,"This story is a masterpiece. The love and loyalty between the 2 main characters Lan zhan and Wei Ying really has an impact on you as a viewer. From the first episode on you are immediately invested in their story. The plot and side plots are strong, but the casting of Xiao Zhan and Wang Yibo in these 2 lead roles is such a stroke of genius, that it takes the series to a whole other level, an unbelievable performance, from both of them. The soundtrack by Lin Hai is also beautiful, especially the tracks with guqin music. I have listened to it many times. This series is so unique, that I hope it has a breakthrough also in the west. I don't randomly gives 10's. But this show deserves it."
tt10554898,"I have never ever seen such beautiful drama! This is the first Chinese drama I've ever watched and already finished it watching 5th time. Never have I ever thought I would be so much addicted to it and the main leads specially Wang Yibo as Lan Wangji, I just can't get over them. Watching this drama made my days so enjoyable now I really miss this. Hopefully able to watch the main leafs together again and yeah forever WANGXIAN!"
tt10554898,"It's totally a worth watching drama. 💖
The story is engaging and you keep wanting to know what's next. It had so many beautiful messages. All the actors are really good, and portray the characters perfectly.
what to say about the leads, their chemistry was so beautiful, best bromance ever.💕 The actors had killed it with their performances 👏👏
It was the most cherished bonding I have ever watched💖 The way their friendship gradually developed from being just 2 opposite poles to relying on each other, taking care of each other, protecting each other, even giving up their reputation & ready to cut ties with the entire world just to stay by each others' side took my heart away 💘
Thanks you team Chén Qíng Lìng for choosing such a beautiful story and also depicting it so mesmerizingly. Thanks to all crew members whom were behind the scenes, u guys worked really hard to get us such a delightful series .
I have already watched it many times and still like to rewatch it... Highly Recommend 💖
Love From India"
tt10554898,"This drama is amazing, unbelievable, incredible... If I had to choose only 1 Drama to watch in my life, it would be the Untamed..."
tt10554898,"Not quite sure how I found out about this Chinese fantasy drama but thankfully, I did. I'm a bit late to the game and not all that familiar with the background but from what I understand now, it was a book or web based story that was turned into an anime series. It's now been recreated live for the screen.At first, it's a lot to take in. I'm not familiar with Chinese shows so wasn't quite sure what to expect. There's a lot of information in the first few episodes and they're more on the silly/fun side. I was worried the whole show was going to be like that but it's not at all. It really builds who the characters are and the relationship foundations. I think it was around the mid teen eps where it started to become more serious and at some point along the way, I became so hooked. This is a binge worthy show which sucked because there are 50 episodes. I did not want to stop watching at all!The special effects can be quite funny at times however the acrobatics are cool, fun, interesting and overall, you forget how low budget some of it seems. The costuming is absolutely gorgeous. It's almost like they put the biggest part of the budget towards costuming rather than CGI. So worth it.The dynamic between the main character, Wei Wuxian and his significant counterpart, Lan Wangji, is beautifully developed and told as well as his familial bonds. The story creates these breathtakingly heartbreaking, emotional scenes that balance well with the lighter humourous scenes in between. I was impressed by the main actors range and with the limited facial expressions of Lan Zhan, that actor really did a great job in expressing so much by doing so little. Excellent!There's a lot to the story and a lot of characters which I had a hard time keeping up with. I'm now watching it again to catch what I missed and the show is just as good, if not better, the second time around. This is an intriguing, entertaining, addictive show that you will stay with you even after it's over. I highly recommend giving it a go."
tt10554898,"This is a small production series, of course the CGI on the most less important parts were done badly. I never thought that I would watch this and get addicted. Screw the people who read the novel, watched the anime and watched 2 episodes of this drama and give a bad rating. I watched the drama and went back to the novel and anime and investigate what went wrong. The drama actually made a lot sense... the problem are the first few episode which made many people a bit lost or just jump into conclusion. By the 6th episode and on, this will be changed around...you will see great acting, great story line, great plotting... and get addict to it... so much sorrow, sadness, joy, happy and fun I had watching this series. Most people came back to watch the first few episode and enjoy the fun after finishing the series! This is how enchanted and wicked this series is."
tt10554898,"This is an incredible saga. Its visually stunning, well scripted, and the actors are superb. I'm hoping for a season 2. I absolutely loved it. I literally could not cut it off. It was wonderful and it will not disappoint from start to finish."
tt10554898,"Literally the most amazing drama. I cried, laughed and fell completely in love with the entire cast. The chemistry between the two leads is undeniable and they're such amazing actors that they completely brought the characters to life. 50 episodes, 44m each is definitely NOT enough, I was left wanting even more considering I binged this show and finished it within 3 days. 10/10 recommend and I lowkey want amnesia so I can rewatch everything."
tt10554898,"Let me start off by saying that this had potential. im not the type to just settle for the bare minimum and say oh this is good simply bc they worked on it even if its bad. and im going to give my honest opinion. i am A BIG fan of mo dao zu shi and i knew this series existed but never watched it bc i thought the clips were cringy. and i still do altho ive warmed up to them. im going to rate everything except plot bc obviously its 10/10 aand imma give u the total breakdown k.1 - acting
the acting is.. fine. if u read the novel u know the actor of wuxian had no other choice but to act in such an annoying way. its just how the character is. all the main leads delivered a pretty decent performance. obviously humans arent natural born zombies and ghosts so when they act like that its going to be awkward, but that doesnt mean they couldnt have done better2 - camera work
the camera work omg yall its so weird. sometimes its rlly good when theyre showing the landscape and area but they zoom on the faces and sometimes theres rlly weird angles and theyre too close to the actors that it gave me secondhand embarassment.3 - props
the props are so bad. they look like pieces of plastic. listen if u dont have the budget altho u know that this series is going to need a lot of expensive looking props then dont take it up! do better!!4 - cgi
theres a lot of cgi bc this is based in a world where magic exists. sometimes it was good and then oh god it was just so bad. shouldve got a better team. the scenes where theyre flying gave me second hand embarrassment .5 - hair and makeup
worst part of this show is going to have to be this category. its not HARD to apply extensions and wigs and have them look good, but they failed to do that. it distracted me so much. idk why theyre heads look so thick making them look ugly probably bc of ur musty wig. these actors are so good looking yet ur stylists managed to make them ugly. Xiao Zhan was the only one who still looked good despite the horrible hair..and makeup? is it rlly that hard to find good artists? the cuts, wounds, scars and blood yk they just look so fake and poorly done. do better miss girl..6 - setting
omg whoever decided on the shooting locations deserves a raise bc theres some beautiful locations that blew my mind and look exactly how i imagined them too. the cloud rec and gusu in general was beautiful honestly. good for the person that picked these locations7 - costumes
this. this is the one. i have nothing to say other than i hope whoever designed and was in charge of costumes is sleeping well rn because they look so fkn good. saved the show and made me forget abt the other flaws.
in conclusion ummm watch this show with caution. the characters are relatable and u will become emotionally attached. byeee"
tt10554898,"I guess I'm the only one who thought that the acting was terrible apart from the two main actors. After watching the live action of Word of honor it was quiet easy to see the differences in quality (acting & costumes/props, and the grandmaster of Demonic cultivation - live action renamed as The Untamed - I felt could've done much much better. I didn't appreciate the changes from the original story either, altering nearly most of the main plots. Eg: WWU's ability to freeze someone on the spot (1st episode). I get that they can't add all the information in the book. The donghua/anime is much recommended and if anyone wanting to know the actual story, read the novel Mo Dua Zu Shi. There are some good English translations on the web."
tt10850932,"It has been several weeks since I watched the last episode of Crash Landing on You and I am utterly shocked by how much I miss these characters. And not just the main characters whose chemistry was magical but all the supporting cast as well. They lent a depth and breadth to this tale--the good guys were endearing and the bad guys were classic. Caution: You will have to suspend judgement about a few circumstances but if you ever read Peter Pan, you will easily want to believe they can fly. Personal note: I started watched K-D's because I am 75 years old and wanted to keep my mind sharp by reading subtitles. I don't know if my mind is sharper but my heart is warmer thanks to this wonderful series."
tt10850932,"I've never, ever watched a Korean show and this show just shook me to the core! The plot is out-of-this-world, truly original, and the acting is amazing!!!! I felt every feeling, I laughed, I cries and I can't get enough of it! It's way better than any Hollywood production. Just do yourself a favour and watch it!!!!"
tt10850932,I made an IMBD account just to write a review for this show. This is my favorite K-drama!!! The story line and the actors and everything about this show is brilliant. I was hooked 5 minutes into episode1!! There's never a boring moment. Love the mix of comedy and action and romance. I also like that each episode is well over an hour long. Easily rated 10/10!!!
tt10850932,"I don't watch korean series much! just randomly play this series on netflix, but this is exception. the more episode i seen .. i the more i am in love with the story line, characters of each role and many more.Hyu Bin & Sonye Jin you guys are rock! Congrats for making korean series worldwide via Netflix"
tt10850932,"Another korean drama that give me the vibe that hard to gain from other dramas. The chemistry, the plot, the cast, the place, the way they act, sooooo gooooooddddd!!! I really love this dramaa. This drama is freaking good. It has the feeling that hard to move on... And also become lot of peoples' favourite. I just don't want this drama to end...will be really missing them, all of the cast."
tt10850932,"What makes this KD different from other KDs?
1. They used older actors which IMO are better in acting. Hyun Bin & Son Ye Jin are definitely the best choice for RJH & YSR character. The chemistry are inevitable!
2. The story is flawless and not boring. There's a speck of love story, comedy, and action in one KD. What not to love?
3. Beautiful sceneries. Omo.
4. Everything makes sense. No stupid magic or ghosts whatever."
tt10850932,"With this KDrama, we have a proven team: terrific writer, director, co-stars, and cast in a delightful love story but also lots of fun with the captain's squad, the village ajummas, a really evil bad guy, and jokes and teasing. These charms are combined with the longing for reunification that handles both North and South Koreans with love and respect. And both leads are at their most beautiful and talented. I swear Hyun Bin has never been better with that quiet, low voice, steady eyes, and sly smile taking every scene but never dominating. And, of course, Son Ye Jin is wondrous: beautiful, brilliant, touching, and hilarious. This series is a treat."
tt10850932,"Anywhere from ""Memories of the Alhambra"" to extreme like ""Rampant"" , ""Crash Landing on You"" is by far more captivating. Anywhere from little hints to Looks of shuttle love gets me on the edge of my seat, but it's his emotions that make it so heartbreaking. He really brings so much emotional acting to the scenes and I should have known watching memories of the Alhambra. But, this has definitely got me hooked. Everyone wants a knight and shining armor with an edge. Korean dramas are much more on spot compared to many and I have to say the writers went where the love and mystery meet...where no one can go. Thank you and I hope to continue watching many more!"
tt10850932,"""If you give up on waiting, the pain of loss will kill you. That's why I wait."" -Captain Ri.Most people who have watched the entire series, love CLOY, which is one of KDrama's finest series, for some of the following points:1. The writer, Park Ji-eun, who also gave us ""You Who Came from the Star"" is one of the best, knowing how to balance drama, comedy, themes, and closure while keeping her audience intrigued and in love with her characters. The director, Lee Jeong-hyo, who has worked on many series and movies, kept everything focused and carefully paced so that the series steadily evolved each week.2. The cast is one of the best I've seen with immensely beautiful and talented leads, warm, hilarious village ajummas, and Capt. Ri's delightful squad, dubbed ""the ducklings""-all of whom became a family for one another and for the viewers.3. Themes varying from the pain of losing family, being abandoned and becoming a street orphan all the way to the belief in a Zen appreciation for patience and waiting, also kindness, protection, sacrifice, and unconditional love. The themes drive the plot, and the cast brought everything to life, making us impatient for each weekend to finally roll around so we can see what happens next to our beloved characters, whether love, laughter, danger and heartbreak, we got on that train with them.4. A great story that keeps the reader interested, a love story whose premise was there from the beginning and revealed brilliantly in the steady epilogues. But also the comedy of the sidekick-and the horror of the bad guy consumed with envy and jealousy that destroys innocence and beauty, making this the classical struggle between good and evil embraced by every generation since time.5. The touching, beautiful OST, which many fans have downloaded. The piano piece ""Song for My Brother"" leaves me in tears every time.6. A wealthy, beautiful but hurt woman who learns to love herself as well as others, who can be hilarious and sassy, yet who finds strength in loving and protecting the most amazing man-Capt. Ri.7. A beautiful man, a pianist who becomes an army officer, a quiet philosopher and tomato plant caretaker with a ""low voice""-the kindest man I believe I've ever seen in any narrative-who adores the hurt woman, knows who she is, finds her, protects her, and loves her no matter what evil, what danger threatens them. Yes, he sounds too good to be true. . . . .but he's not. The whole world is in love with Capt. Ri because Hyun Bin developed him and made us believe that such a man can exist."
tt10850932,"I never understood the global appeal a d popularity of K pop music, dramas and frankly, would have been ignorant if I hadn't given it a try. Netflix happened to be promoting this new title and I enjoyed the trailer...peaked my curiousity and wanted to see more.
I was hooked by the first episode - the witty script, dialogue, music, songs, cinematography and the palpable chemistry not only between the leads but the whole cast - it really caught me pleasantly off guard!
I have and continue to binge watch - since mid february till now (first week of May), I have completed seven K drama series! Am on my eighth one now.
I do have a clear favourite actor - Hyun Bin and pretty sure, many other talented names will be added to this list.
In lockdown, good opportunity to get 'pop cultured'!"
tt10850932,"I recommended this to my British friend who had script writing work experience. For the first 2 episodes, he said this isn't his style - cheesy romantic comedy. But I recommended him to be patient, if you like to write a story.Few weeks later, he texted me ""I am completely addicted to Crash Landing on You !! I blame on you!!!"" Haha succeed !I truly hope that all of you are wishing North and South Korea reunify one day.. and cry with us.."
tt10850932,"""Even if it breaks my heart because it's a dream that can't come true, I'd like to sincerely dream of the future.""I finished this Drama an hour ago and I am still just sitting here, not knowing what to do,...or to write, for that matter.
I am floored. My heart aches. I am happy and sad and amazed and grateful to have been able to watch this masterpiece. I honestly don't know where to begin. My heart is so full.""Crash Landing On You"" is a master class in screenwriting. The pacing, the revelations through flashbacks and unlinear storytelling, the perfect balance between tragedy, romance and humor,...and God, the characters!How is it possible to make each and every character of such a big ensemble so complex, relatable and loveable? I was so attached to every single character, that at some point I basically cried through entire episodes, because even when there were happy scenes, I kept thinking that things would probably not stay like that for all my poor babies. At any given time, while watching CLOY, I just had to think of the whole South Korea - North Korea predicament that they are all in and the tears started flowing.The scenes between Jung Hyuk and Se Ri are so raw and real that I often cried, as well. They say crying doesn't necessarily mean you're sad, it just means you are overwhelmed with emotion - no matter which emotion. And that's exactly how I felt. I was so overwhelmed that I cried when it was sad, romantic and funny.I cried buckets and buckets of tears but I also laughed so hard that my stomach was sore the next day. There are so many funny moments in both, North and South Korea, but I think my favorite was Se Ri's department store opening. I almost died laughing.As an aspiring screenwriter and filmmaker, I am deeply humbled by the masterful stroytelling and breathtaking cinematography. There are so many gorgeous settings, such as all the snow scenes, the night of the train break-down and all the scenes in Switzerland.I am Swiss and I've never seen Switzerland portrayed so beautifully. It made me fall in love with my own country, again. It was strange to see the tram I take every week in a K-Drama. It was strange to see the place I spent vacations as a child. It was strange to see the sights I walk past every day, and have them shown in a new light, looking at them through the eyes of these characters to whom Switzerland represents happiness and their own little paradise. Somehow, seeing some of these incredibly emotional scenes against the Swiss backdrop, made them even more emotional for me.I can't mention the Switzerland scenes without mentioning how perfect the OST is, especially ""The Song For My Brother"", ""Flower"", ""Sunset, ""Here I Am Again"", ""The Hill of Yearning"" and ""Photo of My Mind"", which are the perfect musical expression of the Drama's atmosphere and emotions.Last but not least, the acting is brilliant! I've loved Hyun Bin ever since ""A Millionaire's First Love"", and his on-screen chemistry with Son Ye Jin is out of this world. I am also very happy to have been introduced to Kim Jung Hyun, Lee Shin Young and Seo Ji Hye through this Drama.This drama touched the deepest parts of my soul and will forever stay with me!"
tt10850932,"For a KD to portray and pull off the North Korean culture and dialect deserves an award in itself. So many dramas fail to capture the depiction of North Korea in the positive sense of things, but this KD does everything in its power to show both the good and bad side of the country including the value of belonging in a community. The character development of both leads and supporting cast was also incredible to watch given no one outshone one another, and each character (whether their part was big or small) had an equal opportunity to tell their life story. Moreover, to unite the two Koreas by plotting a developing romance between two people with completely opposite lives and mantra was a genius idea. The energy and undeniable chemistry you felt from the screen b/w the two leads is honestly unmatched, and the fact that I cried in almost every episode goes to show how big of an impact most of the scenes had on me to feel the way I did."
tt10850932,"Recently, I have been trying so hard to get hooked on another K- drama. All I ask is that they keep the humor fresh and the romance sweet.In two episodes, I am already drawn in. I now hope that some romance occurs, but the future of this drama is yet to be determined.The series follows Ye Ri, a South Korean heiress when she accidentally falls into North Korea after a paragliding accident. All because of a tornado that had flying tractors. I laughed when she pointed that out.I hope Ye Ri has a good character development arc, I would love to see her grow. You bet I will continue to watch this. Sign me up, you got a fan."
tt10850932,"It was a long time that I had not watched K-drama before watching this drama and I must say I made a right decision. This drama packs
great scenery: the color and atmosphere are so soothing in Swiss that you wish you could be therelaughs and humor: unpredictable punch lines are not scarcebeautiful love story: you will smile /cry happily and swoon for the couples' cheesy momentsplot full of twists: this drama is not some kind of bland linear story. Its story has depth and meaningmany more: hot actors and actresses, funny supporting characters and lots of moral and life lessons delivered in deep and gentle waysJust watch it and you will have a good time"
tt10850932,How can something be so beautifully written and so amazingly acted at the same time? I have read a lot of other k drama reviews which say the best k drama ever and was disappointed after watching that. But THIS. IS. A. MASTERPIECE. I cried a river watching the last episode and I plan on crying a bit more watching it AGAIN and AGAIN..
tt10850932,"Last K drama I watched was princess hour. In my late 30s, I was told by EVERYONE of my friends and workplace colleagues to watch. After a struggled to watch and reluctance many weeks, one episode, bang, here I watched continuously for 2 days. Until now, I still kept repeat watching for tenth time. The palpable chemistry of both actors could exploded whole North korea, albeit there was very small intimated love scenes. You kept watching laughing, smiling, picking your pillow and crying whole boxed of tissues in one episode. Probably one drama like this in ten years time.
The Romeo Juliet love story like this could not be felt if not the superb acting on both protagonist actors. I hope they will get many awards and some chances to perform in Hollywood series one day."
tt10850932,"I finally finished it, 16 episodes and more than 20 hours of total running time. I'm not a fan of Korean Telenovelas, but I decided to give this one a try because of all the hype and also I thought that anything related to North Korea should be interesting.And it turned out to be quite an amazing series. In fact the hardest thing I had to do was resist watching the next episode because once you start watching it, it's pretty hard to stop.I think the North Korean setting is what makes this series unique and great, and also what kept me going thru some cheesy scenes (this is, after all, a Soap Opera). The setting bought the viewers to an exotic, new place with strange customs, and at the same time allowed the ""Fish Out of Water"" Plot Device on both sides of Korea (a minor spoiler there).Aside from that the series is also very well made in terms of Script and Plot Twists. It initially starts out as a Romantic Comedy with incredibly witty, you-will-fall-out-of-your-chair-laughing dialogue, and eventually evolves into a Soap Opera Thriller towards the middle of the season with clever Cliffhangers at the end of each Episode.The pacing is fast, there are always a lot of things happening onscreen, and the Cinematography is amazing, especially the scenes in Switzerland which made the place almost look like heaven.My only reservation is that is a bit cheesy at times as I mentioned earlier, and also a bit too wholesome for me, which made it feel a bit too unreal at times. I mean, no-tongue kisses, really?And no sex, despite all those gorgeous people sleeping around in each other's apartments? I think they just wanted the series to be as acceptable for as wide an audience as possible.Despite that, overall I would say that this is no ordinary series, it is much better than much of what I have seen on Netflix so far. I think it is an Instant Classic, a Masterpiece that must be seen. Truly outstanding."
tt10850932,"I even joined to this page to rate u guys. that's the only way we can pay our gratitude for u on making such a great drama. I really love this drama.I've got no words. I love the whole team guys.
I've been waiting for something like this and happy that i was recieved it. I am so in love with all actors and most specifically Hyun Bin and Ye jin. Thanks for the amazing acting.
Don't like to get addicted to dramas,that's what I usually do.But I failed this time. I am so much crazy about the whole drama,can't even wait up for new ones.
Anyway,will remember this love story forever and i hope there's gonna be a happy ENDING.
Love and hugs for y'all.
Sew from Sri Lanka..."
tt10850932,"It has many things going for it that will keep both men and women waiting for new episodes. The action, comedy, and drama all have perfect timing and the actors are all great at their craft. Sixteen episodes is not enough for this show!"
tt10850932,"The story is funny and emotional and sometimes also exciting. I really liked the first few episodes (good humor) and the development of the relationship between the main characters (in the beginning at least). I felt however that the chemistry between the main characters could have been better resp. Was not delivered. I also got bored by them halfway through the drama and was actually rather looking forward to seeing the secondary couple and their evolving relationship. Without the secondary characters (and here I mean the soldats, the women from the village and the other couple), I might not have finished the drama... although the scenery in Switzerland was so nice :) Gotta visit my own country next before going abroad #covid19"
tt10850932,"I might be the only one who found this show overrated. It is excessively long with too many unnecessary scenes and too much padding. The portrayal of North Korean people helping someone like Se-ri and being a mix of corrupt, unsophisticated, or peasant types is laughable. This show is the Disney-fication of North Korea, which, in reality, is a cruel, merciless regime. The storyline is utterly ridiculous."
tt11769304,"When we see Yoo Yeon-Seok in this series, one would think of Dr. Romantic. But the similarity stops there. Anyone who's expecting an exaggerated, overly-dramatic plot like Dr. Romantic will be disappointed watching this. Yet, I love this drama - simply for its ability to weave simple narratives into beautiful episodes every week.It goes against any stereotype of love, hospital melodrama, and friendships - and gives you a strong vision of what a healthy relationship is supposed to look like in any aspect. As there are 5 main characters instead of 1, it really is trying to tell us 'we are not the center of attention' - everyone is their own main character. The dramatic events may happen in another room, but the characters themselves are enriching enough that they can hold their own story.It also reflects very healthy and strong friendships. Not every gal and guy that come together must have a romance - platonic friendships can develop and last. Not everything must have an underlying meaning.Finally, I like that there is no 'THE' bad guy. That's the thing about this drama - there are no stereotypes, no bad vs good. It's about living out our lives to the fullest, and enjoying the community around us.Sounds lame? Well, that might say more of ourselves than about the show - how we thrive for excitement in dramatic things but miss out on the beauty and humour in everyday life."
tt11769304,Watch it. korea TV shows has better understanding of the real life then the hollywood does.
tt11769304,"There have been a number of ""hospital shows"" over the years. And yet, with so many, Hospital Playlist is unique. Why? Because it sticks with its strengths: chemistry between the five leads and staying away from the typical hospital politics.Instead, Hospital Playlist is about people. It's about how we, as people, can endeavor to treat others just a little bit better; to put ourselves in the other person's shoes rather than resort to snap judgments. If you remember Patch Adams, you'll find that--for these five doctors at Yuji Medical Center--the people matter more than the disease or injury. In other words, it no longer pays to be indifferent and to block out natural emotions.Hospital Playlist is actually a fairly light show. Yes, it has some tense moments, but overall, it never gets bogged down in melodrama. Instead, it relies upon the unique chemistry of the five doctors who've known each other since medical school. And once a month, they get together and sing a song. Hence, the Hospital Playlist.Each doctor specializes in a certain field. First we have Ik-Jun, who is a general surgeon but specializes in the liver and liver transplants. He's the lead singer of the group, and in many ways, he's the glue of the group. He's the first to crack a joke or do something humorous to lighten the tension. And Jung-Suk Jo is masterful at this! He's got as much talent for comedy as he does for singing. He never takes things too seriously. His job is important, but treating his staff and his patients with respect is always of utmost importance to him.Next we have. Song Hwa who is a neurosurgeon. She's kind, dedicated, and a bit of a workaholic. HIlariously enough, she's someone who THINKS she can sing, but she can't. Actress Jeon Mi Do is actually a professional singer, so to see her purposely sing out of tune is impressive.Seok Hung is the somewhat aloof but dedicated gynecologist in obstetrics. He's every bit as caring about his patients and staff even though it's not always obvious.Jun Wan is the brilliant cardiologist who can appear cold but to characterize him this way would be a disservice. Underneath the tough exterior is a man with a heart who believes that hard work and dedication is a key to success.Last, but certainly not least, we have Jeon Wong Ahn, the professor of pediatrics. Nurses and parents alike adore him for his unique way of handling children. He relates with them. He talks with them, and he never sees them as just another patient.There are many touching and heartfelt moments throughout the series as we journey along with them through the days, weeks, months, and even years. Don't be surprised if you find yourself shedding a few tears one moment and then roaring out loud with laughter in the next. That's the Hospital Playlist. In the end, it provides comfort. It provides hope that people can still treat each other with respect, with compassion, and with empathy.If you're a music lover, you'll find a cache of great songs, all sung and performed by the characters. At the end of each episode of Hospital Playlist, we are reminded not to take life so seriously. We're reminded that life is supposed to be joyous and fun.At some point, I will definitely want to re-watch this great series. So, if you're looking for something that is light, with many feel-good moments, as well as many hilarious ones, I'm sure you love Hospital Playlist!"
tt11769304,"Friendship. Love. Life. Death. Music.Not your usual medical drama. I laughed, cried, sang, and danced. Superb screenplay! Fell in love in Ik-Jun (Jo Jung Suk) Felt like I was cheating on Hyun Bin.😂My Thursdays won't be the same anymore. I truly loved this drama. Cheers to all the cast and crew. See you next year for Season 2.It's 10/10 for me. Highly recommended. 💖#HospitalPlaylist"
tt11769304,"Great series, great cast and storyline, this just gets you hooked up right from the beginning. Don't miss out on this wonderful series."
tt11769304,"A few of the reviewers seem to be turned off by the fact that there is no ""central "" storyline but i would argue that there is no central dramatic storyline is the very thing that appeals to me about the show. It is a story about an enduring friendship and the everyday lives of those in a hospital told with humor and compassion. There is beauty and love and tears and laughter and triumphs and failures to be found in all of our daily lives. What is wrong with trying to capture that in a drama? I really enjoy the ensemble acting and the mini-stories in each episode. I hope to be treated with as much compassion as these doctors show if I ever find myself in a hospital needing surgery."
tt11769304,"Hospital Playlist has been written by the same writer who wrote ""Reply 1988"", Lee Woo-jung. The producer is also the same, Shin Won-ho. The work that this combination creates is absolutely fantastic. Hospital Playlist shares a lot of the same vibe of ""Reply 1988"".Hospital Playlist does not have a central storyline. Instead, we see the storylines of the 5 main characters, who are all medical doctors in the same hospital, friends, and also musical band mates. There are plenty of smaller subplots that stretch out over multiple episodes, be sure not to miss those. And do not miss the easter eggs or cameos that the creators added that refer to ""Reply 1988"". This TV drama requires some attention span in the beginning, but once you are suck in their worlds, you will share their heartwarming joy and heartbreaking tears.Like Reply 1988, we have a group of 5 friends: 4 guys, 1 girl. We get a look in their lives. It is very realistic and funny. All the cast is sublime and excellent. They bring their characters to life in such a wonderful way. Each episode you get a very welcome musical intermezzo near the end when the 5 friends come together to play a song live as a band. The songs they play are older Korean power ballads with strong lyrics that capture perfectly the main feeling of each episode. And there is a running gag of the female neurosurgeon Chae Song-hwa, played wonderfully by Jeon Mi-do, who is tone deaf and does not have a feeling of rhythm, but still wants to be a vocalist. It makes you smile from ear to ear.I absolutely enjoyed Hospital Playlist, season 1. It is such a wonderful TV drama that is heartwarming and heartbreaking. You get to laugh and to cry. Definitely recommended, get started and watch it!"
tt11769304,"What a heartwarming tv drama! All five main characters are wonderful and what makes them even better is their friendship and how much they love each other.The hospital stories they show are both wonderful and heartbreaking. Extremely realistic.If you're thinking of starting this, do it without even blinking.I look forward to the new season!!"
tt11769304,"What a fantastic series. A brilliant, very highly talented cast of my favourites. I love the band! I love, love this Drama because every episode make me laugh and Cry😍🎶
Every Soundtrack in this drama give something valuable thing to Community..."
tt11769304,"Grey's Anatomy, Take Your Scalpel & Go Home, Now. K-Band-Aid is In The HOWSE-pitalI put off watching this highly rated show for a while because I found the name unappealing. Well, what's in a name?This series follows 5 friends from college that eventually end up working at the same hospital in Seoul. Now that they are all back in Seoul, they resurrect their college band by working on 1 song a month, to ensure they take time to be together. Whether the above pre-screening sounds like a solid basis for a hospital drama or not, it's merely the setting. What matters is the relationships, particularly as embodied in the writer/director/actors. In any case, HP has stitched together an outstanding fellowship of talent. Stick with the regimen for 3 episodes, at least, before determining its effectiveness. Ep1 gets off to a slow start and there are several scenes that won't be understandable until later. Once things get rolling they never slow down again.HP is about friendship first, but also caring+respect for others, love, parents & children, music, and lots and lots of #food. The hospital scenes, including staff dynamics and operating room procedures, feel realistic. The characters are a delight.Here's a shout-out to Jo Jung-Suk. I fell in love with him when watching the divine Oh My Ghost-10. He delivers another slam dunk with his performance as Dr. Lee Ik-jun. Everyone does a great job.This just pertains to season 1. I haven't started season 2 yet.((((🕕))))With season 2 now watched, the diagnosis is that their practice in season 1 rendered season 2 even #more effective. It continues with the uplifting treatment of the subjects, and it's a resounding hit. Picking up right where it left off, there's a seamless connection to season 1.Early in season 2 there's a 🏓 tourney. Cardio-Thoracic Sx was looking good - until they had to concede in order to respond to an emergency. At least half of the matches seemed to be decided that way. Instead of mic drops, we see paddle drops. We get to hear other docs gossip about the great Lee Ik-jun: 'I heard Dr Lee was in the 🏓 Club in college. In fact, I heard he was in EVERY club in college. He was even in the magic🔮 club.' Comfortably confident, Ik-jun tells Song-hwa: ""I'll return victorious before this tea gets cold."" (Nope. Nuclear Medicine runs the tables). His defeat is commemorated with these words: ""Tasting Defeat and savoring victory: These are the things that allow us to grow.""Let's take a moment to review the primary protagonists.In season 2, Lee Ik-jun continues to play Dr Cupid. While Ju-wan (the cardiologist) is worried about Ik-jun discovering whom he's dating. We must wonder: Why worry? How could Ik-jun deny anybody love? Watch to see. He has time to play cupid, and also cover for the lunch lady because he's so brilliant that everything is easy for him. Besides, he's friends with the lunch lady on social media, and her son had a parole hearing. The only thing that takes Ik-jun more time than other docs is walking through the hospital. That's because the highly loquacious Ik-jun is friends with everybody - security guards, aides, custodians, scattered guardians... Just everybody.Ah, the unparalleled and misnamed SONG-hwa. She can do everything: neurosurgery, research, office visits, lectures,,, one of her biggest timetakers is her mentoring of any and all residents in their educational, professional, and even personal lives. She can do everything but sing. She sings anyway, with masses of verve. She gets pleasure out of little things, like rain. She dances at church and eats like a Sumo wrestler. Utterly delightful, she's the heartbeat of the gang, excepting the band.Seok-hyung lost a little weight and he looks great in season 2. He declined to take over his father's business and continues to rise to near celebrity popularity as an Ob/Gyn, despite his modest and somewhat shy persona. Patients respond to his gentle and caring manner. One office visit depicts amazing ultrasound footage of a 10 week old fetus wiggling its arms and legs. The couple's reaction is precious. Still focused on Seok-hyung, his mother remains unable to resist attempts to try to control him. She wants grandchildren. Now. She tells him: 'I don't care who it is. Just get married.'Dr. Chu continues to try and insert herself into Seok-hyung's life. In season 2 he's neither encouraging nor rejecting her efforts. Dr. Chu is not easily daunted. In fact, she's downright inspirational. Openly pursuing Seok-hyung, she often makes him laugh. Dr. Chu runs into Seok-hyung's mother - literally. Mom was so offended that she even told Rosa she doesn't care whom Seok-hyung marries, as long as it isn't #HER!, speaking of Dr. Chu.Ju-wan is unchanged in season 2, and his relationship with Dr. Do, whom he is training, continues to improve. We get to meet Dr. Do's wife in season 2.The pediatrician, Dr. Ahn (Andrea/Jeong-won) treads the course set in season 1. There's not a lot to say w/o spoiling some surprises. He complains that his siblings are worried about mom, but as they can't help ""right now"", they bombard him with calls. In rich irony he laments: ""Why did they enter the church, really?""We see the return of almost all the side characters: Parents, siblings, other doctors, residents, as well as new first years. They all continue to round out the show well.Uju wants to go camping, so Ik-jun finally leaves his beloved city life for a weekend, because his son is his world. Hmmm. Who else loves 🏕?Gy-eol is looking relaxed and even pretty, especially with her hair down. We learn more about her in season 2.As a side note, there's a realistic basis for the show. The positive connection between surgeons and music has actually been studied. The participants currently playing a musical instrument, at the time of the study, performed the laparoscopic tasks significantly faster than those who did not. They determined that visuo-spatial abilities used in laparoscopic performance clearly may be enhanced for individuals playing a musical instrument. It seems obvious that finger strength and dexterity should also be positively affected.Even though HP is a top-ten show
in all of Korea's history, there are currently no plans for a season 3. The writer has completed the originally scripted storyline. That is the current status, but there's actually numerous ways to continue the drama. For now, it's a wrap. If you are one that dreads waiting for another season as it it's a multistage invasive treatment plan, it's safe to go forward with the HP procedure now, and hope for a recurrence in the future.IMHO〰🖍🎬9 🤔6 🎭9 ⚡4 💓8 🦋5 🎵 9 🎨6 🔚9Suggested Age 12& up, with a caveat: One unmarried couple is shown in bed together with enough skin showing to infer what's unmistakably been going on.

tt11769304,""" Hospital Playlist "" is one of the hyped dramas of 2020 and you are going to like it if you loved dramas like Reply 1988. However, even though there are not many reviews that are not praising this drama, Hospital Playlist is not for everyone.The drama keeps a slow tempo, with the story being spread throughout the drama, probably so it can serve the next two seasons coming up next. Maybe that's when the drama picks up. And yes, this is a slice of life, but, at times, it felt like there was nothing to look forward to in the next episode. Also, there were moments when the drama got boring too.That said, they did handle the romance masterfully, as to not overshadow the friendship and so that it didn't become the main focus of the drama. They did a good job with the blend of music and story too, as well as with the flashbacks of their old days.Finally, when it comes to performances, the drama of course had excellent ones, as the cast was consisted by the best of the best.So, overall, six and a half out of ten, because there were some nice moments to the drama, but it felt like there was no story to it."
tt11769304,"I dont understand how this dramas get really good reviews , I love drams because its short and show us interesting story with some cute and romantic moments including fun. As we knows that many of K Drama leads work in business companies but they dont always show us meetings and all but we see them hanging out having fun watch some romanic moments between leads. I watched hospital playlist because the review was quite nice , and I have to watch whole season while waiting for something interesting. The drama is more slower then turtle , believe me there was no story all the time they only showed surgeries. In half or more than half drama you will only watch surgeries. The most said dialogue is am on my way , I will be right there and just this. There was no reason to make season 2. They could have make 16 episodes with nice pace story. I watched 2 part while skipping half of episode because I dont want to watch surgery. I gave 4 star just for LEE IK JUN AND SWANG HAN character. Their chemistry was amazing amoung all of the couples. LEE IK JUN character always make you smile or laugh , I only didn't skip part of him except surgery one. Its based on hospital that doesn't mean you have to show us surgeries all the time. Am writing this big review so you guys can know what you are gonna watch. The story and drama could have more likable if they keep it short and showed less and more less surgery scene and more romantic and cute scene between main leads. Although its up to you now if you want to waste your time or not."
tt11769304,"This is one of the few TV shows I can wholeheartedly give a 10 rating. I love this series, watched twice the first season and going on the second season.The friendship depicted in this series is so heartwarming, not just for the 5 main casts but also their interaction and kindness towards their interns, fellows & nurses. Even the long lasting friendship between Rosa and the Director of the medical centre is just so warm - a friendship spans for 65 years and still going strong!The characters' development is another success, we grew to love all the cast (even the supporting roles) bits by bits through their actions, interaction with each other/other characters. Each episode provides us a good life lessons focusing on human behavior and emotions, the happiness when love one is healed, sadness when love one passed and the pain in between waiting for miracles to happen. It really pulled my heartstring. It motivated me to become a better person, be kind and more attentive to my family, friends and be more compassionate/empathy to strangers who are in need.I love all the actors and actresses; they all give very good performance. The child actor is so cute and the music is simply superb. One lovely thing about this series is the romance is not cheesy, because we all know Korean shows tend to get OTT cheesy when it comes to romance, and we do not have any super ""bad"" people, we see people of different characters/behavior, all with their own flaws but aren't we all have flaws?Overall, I highly recommend this series to anyone."
tt11769304,"Brilliant and beautiful; sweet and wonderful. Strongly recommended, and cannot wait for the next seasons with this fabulous cast, director, and writer. What a treat."
tt11769304,"I love how this series doesn't exactly have like a 'main conflict'. the storyline revolves around the everyday life of the main cast and i love how it just flows. it is also heartwarming and funny. the chemistry between the main cast is also amazing. i think this series is for those who are looking for light and fun dramas, without too many cliches or conflicts."
tt11769304,"I loved all the characters so much I finished this drama in about 2 days lmaoo. The storyline itself isn't too heavy, but at the same time covers so many different emotions. I'm so excited how season 2 will turn out!"
tt11769304,"This drama deserves the attention and love from the viewers. It's full of lessons about friendship, family, humanity, and love. No dramatic twist, no political treachery and no characters to be hated. Simply, it showcased empathy rather than an individual's story. It made you smile, laugh, cries, and surely will miss your friends especially these pandemic situations.For the first episode, you might be confused about the characters and faces because there are so many casts; Doctors, Nurses, Interns, and others. But as the story progresses you can identify them and you'll be impressed how well the story lined up from the hospital to playlist. This drama gives you a warm touch with morals and lessons that are taught throughout the 12 episodes.Bravo to the main cast because they lived their characters impressively. Each portrayal has its own unique factors and differences. I love their music, their band, and bonding. I love this medical drama, and I can't wait for season 2 hopefully by next year."
tt11769304,"I must admit this drama has everything!
It is not any typical ""hospital Kdrama"", this drama is surely different. There are many scenes where I could feel the scenes! For example, the doctor-patient relationship, the father-son relationship! These things happen in reality, not like other 'hospital stories' we get to see in hospital story based dramas! And those real emotions literally touched my heart!!!
Hats off to the all of the actors! Moreover, the songs, refreshing scenes.. Honestly, I cannot finish saying all of the sides for which everyone must watch this drama.
I just want to say: ""I am genuinely glad that this drama has been made & I feel happy for the fact that I did not ignore the drama rather I have watched this beautiful unique drama!""
Whoever is watching my review, please do watch this drama. I can bet you will tell yourself, your time was worth of watching this drama!!"
tt11769304,This show is so heartwarming that it just makes you feel happy after every episode. I've finished watching season 1 a long time ago but i find myself re-watching some clips at times when i feel down. The OST is great as well!Highly recommended!
tt11769304,"Life's definition is very different for every one. In this drama we get to meet 5 characters who have been friends since medical school. Unlike the other medical drama which usually go for dramatic, suspenseful and depressing tone, this drama went for a light, musical feel. It's a success. This show hits all the right notes with its ensemble cast of musical actors, best direction and great script. So what if the series has no specific theme to it? How will it be different from other kdramas then? The series derives its distinct identity in this only.. It tells several mini stories through the eyes of these 5 characters. Loved their musical jamming. I felt envious that I never got to make such a gang of friends. Can't wait to see season 2. Shin won ho has done it again. Exceeded all expectations.. After all he has given us the Reply series, and Prison Playbook. Aloha... 😘😍"
tt11769304,"Only revolves around hospital, patients and eating food. Totally waste of time. Please reconsider before watching. Over 90% of scenes are of hospital and surgery surgery surgery. Story is good but same plot each episode with little bit of difference which creates curiosity to watch next one."
tt11769304,"I'm giving this 2/10 as the cast is good but that's pretty much it. I've watched 4 episodes only but that's because that's all netflix has released at this stage. I tried watching and thinking it'll get better in the next episode. Never did. Nothing happens. Like another reviewer said, ""there isn't a main story line"" or something like that and they are right. The medical story lines have been recycled a million times over. If you've watched any hospital drama in the past you've seen this one. The only difference is is that there isn't actually a point to their stories. If you want to see 5 friends hang out, play music, and talk about nothing and the storyline not have any drive or hook then go ahead and watch this. There might be mini stories within the episode but nothing gripping. I honestly can say it's just about 5 friends who all happen to be great doctors in their chosen fields and who all happen to work in the same hospital and that's about it."
tt11769304,"The most easy to view because of the wonderful chemistry seen between the characters. It makes me love each one! And look up for other shows of each actor.
I love the show. I'm waiting with enthusiasm another season. It was a long time before I see every episode twice. Please, start season 2 soon!
Thanks for that drama show."
tt11769304,"If ur looking for drama and plot twists, its totally not for you. The movie weave simple narratives about daily life into each ep. Felling like all characters are main, they got their own signature that set a special impression. The academic content makes it so real and professional. I had to replay some scenes cuz its super cute, funny, lovely, etc. Truly love it. Production team please do till ss 10 and more."
tt12190580,"To all of the people who say they like reality shows - THIS is actual reality. Not The Bachelor or the Real Housewives of wherever.and certainly not anything to do with Kardashians. You not only see what these people have to deal with in what their job is, but you also see what they have to deal with that ISN'T their job. And you fully see medical procedures, surgery, birthing... and that's all in the first episode alone. This show will give any viewer a new-found appreciate for what these people do and how much they sacrifice for others."
tt12190580,Lenox Hill is the best docu-series I have ever seen. It is so real as you are literally in the OR during brain surgery. It is so fascinating to see how well these doctors work together and how well they treat their patients! Cannot wait for season 2!
tt12190580,"I don't watch reality TV shows. Just not my type, especially after associating them with the Kardashians or Wifes ""something""..
Even reading a bit of description of it being about working in a hospital. But anyway, I was really stressed one day so i just pressed play on Netflix. To run it in the background while I was finishing some work.
Wow! I can't even write on the qualities and the faith and respectbit gave back for the hard work, ethics, humanity the medical staff show throughout the episodes.
Not only that is entertaining, but is also educational(!). Im addition to this, I was very hooked also on the cases they show throughout the series. With the permission and support of the patients and their families we can actually witness the real hopes, fears, joy and tragedies the families and medical staff are going through.
A big round of applause is in order for the patients, their families, medical staff and the producers of this show!"
tt12190580,"What a lovely peek into the human side of being a medical professional. All the talent, publications, money and glamour doesn't change the fact that they are all just human beings who need love and encouragement and some compassion just like the rest of us. Well done"
tt12190580,"Wow, I have such respect for all these doctors. What a well implemented reality show that shows the real operation of a hospital, the integrity, heartaches, headaches and joys of being a physician in a wonderfully rich hospital. This was fine tv! Thanks!!!!"
tt12190580,"Can't recommend this enough. It's riveting- full of beauty, pain, sadness, hope. These docs and these patients will stay with you long after you finish watching. I've been an RN for 31 years, but away from the bedside for a decade. This makes me ache to go back and reminds me what a privilege it is to do this work."
tt12190580,"I thank Netflix and the neurosurgeons in this documentary for showcasing Glioblastoma. No one wants to have anything to do with this cancer and yet, we have to live it. I hope this documentary helps people to understand this cancer as well as inspire others to help find a cure."
tt12190580,"A must watch. I cried, I laughed, I got angry. It was good to see motion from surgeons. I always feel like they're complete robots but to see them feel & cry got me so emotional."
tt12190580,I feel privileged having almost a firsthand experience of what goes on in the world of medicine and surgery. I particularly like the way they also follow the personal lives of the doctors themselves. Well worth your time!
tt12190580,The creators of this documentary are absolutely geniuses. The people are inspiring. It's really interesting. What a great work! I can't wait to see more of what they have!!
tt12190580,Have just watched the entire series with my wife back to back. Real like issues with the most amazing people who do every day try a save lives! Highly recommend!
tt12190580,"Lenox Hill is a reality documentary series following the daily lives of four physicians-- an ER doctor, an Ob/Gyn and two neurosurgeons, at the Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. The show gives you a great sense of the day-to-day for these professionals, which include both long hours and highly stressful and emotional situations. The ER doctor and the Ob/Gyn have an added storyline in that they are both pregnant through the span of the series and get to experience the system as patients themselves. The last episode is something of a bonus as the show revisits three of the doctors as they cope with the initial stages of the Covid pandemic in New York.This show is real life and then some. We get to witness several live births, a whole bunch of harrowing brain cancer surgery, and an incredibly unpredictable parade of patients through an urban ER. Some of the scenes are heartbreaking, especially those when one of the neurosurgeons has to explain to a cancer patient and their family that they have exhausted all options. Some scenes are triumphant, as especially two neurosurgeons are cutting edge practitioners who do miraculous things to save their patients. Everything is fascinating, as you get a really good sense of what life would be like for you if you had followed your parents' advice and become a doctor. I feel actually rather lucky that these professionals have invited everyone into their world to see what their lives are like."
tt12190580,"There are some good story lines in this documentary. it is well-directed and doesn't fall into the trap of other medical documentaries of only focusing on the success stories.The were well-developed stories on the care-givers that were easy to follow. The stories on the patients were more fragmented, and the editing created problems for me to follow all of those. A couple patient stories were well-told.It was worth the time, but it could have been better."
tt12190580,It's actually the best medical documentary I have ever seen !
tt12190580,"This docu series is truly spectacular. Rich story telling and beautiful cinematography. I love how NYC is treated like a 5th character. Wonderful to see the frontline caregivers before Covid which makes you realize they were heroes all along. Would love to see a season 2 to see how the biggest healthcare crisis in recent times impacted them, their patients, their community and their hospital. Well done Netflix."
tt12190580,"I just watched this series and I am deeply impressed! The love and compassion these teams have for their patients and each other is amazing! I hope this series continues!As a retired Social Worker, I would like to see the staff reach out to them for themselves and their patients."
tt12190580,"Dr. David amd Dr. John are, in their own unique and loving ways, two of the most caring amd compassionate people. They truly are devoted to their field without aroganance.Really, really enjoy the show"
tt12190580,"This is an incredible show! An emotional roller coaster in the most realistic sense. The highs the lows the happiness and sadness. The laughter and also anger, you will feel it all. If you don't feel completely and utterly in awe of these phenomenal people then there's something wrong. I have always been so intrigued and interested in the behind the scenes ongoings of hospitals and the medical field in general. Seeing these talented and gifted doctors doing their jobs and so much more is a beautiful blessing. I feel honored to have been able to ""get to know them"". I truly hope there are many more seasons bc this was fantastic."
tt12190580,"About to enter my first year of medical school and this was really touching. Gives me a lot of motivation and drive and just awe at the whole medical community and the wonderful work that they do. People are so layered and so complicated and this was an experience of that. Great series, really well-made."
tt12190580,"I have been a HUGE fan of medical shows such as Grey's Anatomy, ER, New Amsterdam, etc. and I have to say that Lenox Hill was AMAZING!! This show was well put together and truly portrays the day in the life of these docs. I am a nurse that works for a cardiac ambulatory practice for Lenox Hill and it gave me great pride to watch this. These docs are truly changing the lives not only of their patients but the family members of those patients who walk their journey together. I have to say that I personally cried from episode 4 to the end. I lost my mother 7 years ago to a Glioblastoma, so I felt very connected to the stories of Dr. Bookvar's patients. He passion and compassion for not only his patients but for the work he does and the research and clinical trials that he continues to push for are a testament to his dedication to his field. This is a MUST watch! You will not be disappointed!"
tt12190580,"This is a beautiful series, and I feel thankful for being allowed this view into the lives of the staff of this hospital."
tt12190580,"It's obvious from the start that the Doctors are supremely talented at Lennox Hill that care deeply about their patients medical health. However, the drawl should be about the patients- especially undergoing life and death via risky with some surgeries -almost guaranteeing a quality of life change in return.After three episodes, I have yet to see anything more than a brief next day check-in from the doctors before they head on to the next thing. What happens to these patients next, how are they holding up when returning back home? Drug addicts get no counseling and the Doctors barely look at them. What happens to the homeless that come in.Doctors aren't that fascinating often completely unaware of that the viewers can handle the diagnosis and would like to hear more about the diseases. That's interesting! The patients and their family dynamic is far more interesting than watching doctors and staff briskly th Rey Pugh halls, eating snacks and talking on the phone. Trade that for the real stories and more follow up and you have a great binge worthy series.(Typos :/ )"
tt12190580,"Couple of episodes in, this docu-medical-procedural shows what it actually is: real-tv. Which of course isn't especially truthful but just deals with the trash.Often soapy, rarely authentic, presents mildly uninteresting characters whose standings span from politically correctness to downplayed autocelebration. From stoic workaholicism to ""inspiring"" progressive views and good will to hippie/theological attitudes.
Exactly what is expected to cater to its target audience (families, mostly women, >40yo).The most interesting parts are those few in which we see these physicians not act in front of the cameras. I.e. when they explain (gild the pill? lie? an act in the non-act?) to their terminally ill patients that the surgery went ""well"" or that there's yet another new promising experimental procedure they should be trying. Or when they lose their temper, deal with the bureaucracy, the repetitive/exhausting shifts or anything truly unexpected.Unfortunately the production shows these more as an accident than as the unheroic substance of these people's lifes.Don't get tricked into thinking that since it's effortless to watch, then it's a good thing: it's like another ""Big Brother""; you feel like you're among real people... and you're actually wasting your time."
tt12190580,"Not as dramatic as GA but just as watchable. Gives you blunt facts straight to the face, an insightful show that leads your to understanding not only what goes behind the curtains (no pun intended) but also inside their head. You'll have a whole lot more respect for health workers after watching it, totally worth binging."
tt12190580,A trully compelling docu-series and we can def admire all the doctors that participated in it. Their honesty vulnerability and incredible strength was heart-breaking and amazing to watch at the same time.I hope they will continue with a second season in the future.
tt6163070,"I heard from a friend of mine that this is totally worth the Netflix subscription service because of multiple reasons like this show teaches kids about all kinds of topics like dinosaurs, cars, space and colors along with funny dialogue and recognizable and rememberable characters you have got yourself a 10 out of 10 show to remember."
tt10687464,My 6 year old loves it! I love that it's educational. I hope Netflix continues to make this series. Great for home/virtual schooling!
tt10687464,"My kids ages 2-6 all enjoyed this show. I Loved that they were short and included an at home version of what they do each episode. Fun thing to include in at home learning.
Also bonus: it's not annoying to listen to in the background while catching up on chores 😆"
tt10687464,"Short episodes covering various scientific topics, plus an easy activity at the end. This show is really fun, and doesn't talk down to kids. I think kids of any age would benefit from watching."
tt10687464,Episodes are a quick watch (less than 15 minutes) and enjoyable to learn some quick science facts. Activities are fun to watch and the home activity is easy to do and will keep your children or grandchildren engaged. Great new show and perfect to use as a teaching aid as schools begin welcoming back students whether in person or virtually.
tt10687464,My daughter's 2nd grade teacher recommended. Such a fun show with cool experiments to try!
tt10687464,"It's hard to find shows that I feel comfortable letting my daughter watch, but Emily's Wonder Lab is fun, educational, and I don't mind having it on in the background while I work. It's a great show!"
tt10687464,My science- loving 5-year-old binge watched all 10 episodes. Emily is a wonderful teacher and role model.
tt10687464,My kids love this show and I love having more female science communicators. I had an instant reaction when I noticed she was pregnant during the filming of the first season. It's so rare that women are shown on air pregnant and it made me super happy to see it!!!!
tt10687464,My young daughters are fascinated by Emily's Wonder Lab. They have seen every episode at least 10 times. Emily does an incredible job of making science accessible. This is the EXACT kind of show that as a parent I want them to watch. I hope Netflix listens to all the parents out there that want good educational content and brings Emily back for more seasons.
tt10687464,"Like the kids on the show, each episode teaches everyone, including me, a 69-year-old fogey, some interesting things about science. Sometimes I find kids' shows more educational than documentaries."
tt10687464,All 3 of my kids love watching this show! I hope they continue it!
tt10687464,"I usually watch science show for kids, with my kids. Thisone is no better or worse than others, my kids like it, so I'm ok with that. But the kids' lines are SO horribly cheesy and scripted that I really (personally) can't stand watching it. It's the idea by an adult of how an annoying knowitall brat SHOULD talk. Education by the trowel."
tt10687464,"Emily Calandrelli is fantastic in this, but the terrible child actors, lousy production decisions, horrible music and superficial science lessons are burdens that are impossible to escape. Why in the world did they think that casting hammy kid actors and having them do reality tv style confessionals (with punchline zooms and canned laughter, for some reason) was a good idea?As a science lover with a young child, I couldn't be more disappointed that this fell so flat."
tt10687464,"Let me start by saying, I think the show ranks pretty high among children's science shows. The downside, however, is that some of the experiments aren't very practical or accessible to be redone or attempted by children of th suggested audience age range. And the show is so exciting and interesting that your kids will want to try it and be upset that you can't afford 500 gallons of corn syrup or toothpaste. One experiment in particular involved lighting a teabag on fire, so that it would float away and burn up. There's no mention that this is a very controlled experiment and that not all teabags are created equal. Five times at least now I've had to stop my son from wanting to light teabags on fire, and on the same day he saw the episode, we extracted some more thin paper from our toaster that he had stuffed in trying to recreate the experiment after not being able to recreate the one in the show. Do I blame the show? Not exactly, kids develop an interest in fire - but I think that episode in particular was pretty thoughtless about the fire experiment given the age range of the show."
tt10687464,Both of my kids love this show! It is so great showing such a positive female role model for my daughter. Girls can love science too! And I love the hosts cute pregnant belly!! It's a fun show to watch even for adults!!
tt10687464,"I grew up watching Bill Nye the Science Guy in elementary and middle school and was drawn into how awesome science and experimenting can be. It has clearly been a catalyst for the person I am today, now in my 30's. Emily's Wonder Lab gives me that same feeling some 20 years later. Knowing that it was her dream to film a science show for young, curious, little scientists and to see it come to fruition just about makes my heart explode with happiness!"
tt10687464,My 3 year old daughter loves this show so much! We have been able to do the experiments with stuff in our house. I love that this introduces science for kids and is educationally entertaining instead of just fluff to entertain.
tt10687464,"Teaching summer school, the kids are usually exhausted from entire school year and just want to have fun. These episodes are perfect intro videos to our science lessons. There's not a ton of information getting thrown at them, it's just enough to get them excited to explore the ""why?"" Then I go through them and we discuss any questions they might have. Then do an experiment to keep them asking. Love it."
tt10687464,"They dropped the ball with this show. The presenter is a little annoying but that's not a deal-breaker.The thing I dislike most about the show is the obvious scripted and rehearsed comments from the participants. Honestly, those kids couldn't come across less natural if they tried.This trend of cutting away to people being interviewed as though they are organically commenting on the events has gone far enough. It isn't convincing and it adds nothing to the flow of the show. Indeed, it detracts from the show.On the other hand, Emily's Wonder Lab has the potential to be quite engaging. The experiments and the actual scientific content are all interesting... it's just a shame about the execution."
tt10687464,She needs to keep her agenda to herself and stick to real science. Otherwise she has no business teaching children. She needs to stop looking for attention to her personal opinion of matters that have no business being mentioned on a children's program. She's trying to groom children.She needs to be fired.
tt10687464,"I had such high hopes for this show, but found it to be very lacking in actual science or information. The concept is there, the host is enthusiastic, and the activities are eye-catching, but the education component is half-baked. The child actors' lines are predictably cheesy, and overall it was not a great use of screen time."
tt13885302,I have to say that this drama has moved into my top 3 favorite shows. I can't wait to see the next show and I find myself becoming more and more emotional with the development of Lee Chae Rok and Shim Deok Chul's heartwarming relationship. The director Dong-Hwa Han should be given a standing ovation as well as an academy award in my opinion. I look forward to seeing many more shows by this amazing director and awesome writers Lee Eun-Mi and Hun. The cast is also academy award worthy. They work so well together.... outstanding job of cast choice!
tt13885302,I wish more people would watch this drama. It's not a typical romantic or action series which interest the majority but the story alone can move anyone cuz it's so heart-warming and touching. Plus the acting is superb.
tt13885302,What an incredible acting! I knew that koreans are good artists but the performances of In-Hwan Park and Song Kang are worthy of a Golden Globe. I waited until the last episode to write this review. This is an amazing drama about life itself from the very beginning to the end. This series made me cry and I must point out that I am not an emotional person.
tt13885302,"No spoilers here, but this excellent series is even more well-done than most Korean dramas. It puts American TV to shame. I don't give many ""10"" scores but this one effortlessly earns it. Acting, story, staging, music ... this one scores in every category. Not to be missed."
tt13885302,"Amazing story, the acting is great, you can feel both main characters dreams! You can definitely enjoy this show."
tt13885302,"Heartwarming story of a friendship and care being developed between a young man and an old one.Never give up on your dreams no matter what, is the 1st message.Talent with no hard work and practice is not enough to win, is the 2nd message.Forgiveness and understanding warms and heals people's hearts, is the 3rd message.What can I say about this MASTERPIECE!!! I am speechless!!!The 2 leads were performing so amazingly that they were capturing the screen and our hearts! Park In-Hwan was so great!!!! Song Kang (OMG!!!) was stunning, a God of acting and beauty!!! I admired him for his versatility and his skills!!!The aesthetics of this series in the ballet scenes was out of this world!!! I loved them especially in the last episode, where I watched them again and again!!!I have seen about 90 kdrama series so far, and this one is definitely now one of my top favorites in my list.Very well done to all cast, director, script writer and the rest crew. You all did a great job! :)"
tt13885302,"One of the best dramas I have seen. Is a reminder never to let go of your dreams no matter how old you are, it is inspiring and so beautiful.Had me crying so many times, specially touching as someone in my family suffered from dementia.You can't miss going on this journey with Duk-Chol.Thanks for making this wonderful show."
tt13885302,Just finished watching the last episode with tears in my eyes but also with the biggest grin. It was a very satisfying ending to a beautifully done story of a man achieving his dream long after an age when most wouldn't even begin trying. The love and respect between the teacher and student is obvious but so is the love of family and friends. A great family show that can be enjoyed by a wide audience.
tt13885302,"This is the only Kdrama in which I cried on all episodes! Bravo, Song Kang (Chae-Rok) and Park In-wan (Shim Deok-chul)! You both deserve awards for this drama.I am truly impressed on how all the actors delivered their characters magnificently!Massive salute to the Director, Han Dong-hwa and Screenwriter Lee Eun-mi!10/10 without a doubt! Highly recommended!Grand jeté! 💞
Soar high, everyone!!! 💙"
tt13885302,"A story that is worth watching .
Best plot and great acting."
tt13885302,"Much like the image of the butterfly and the soul in poetry and art, this series is superb, sweet, and compassionate with the grace and elegance of ballet as the frame for the deeply touching real story. The cast, direction, cinematography, and writing are outstanding: not a misstep anywhere as all involved work to tell the story of discovery, friendship, love, support, forgiveness, and healing. Filmed with such love and gentleness, this is one of Korea's finest series in its relatively short but brilliant history. Strongly recommended."
tt13885302,"It's good enough but not that good! It's highly rated so it's only natural to get into it with high expectations, unfortunately, it became quickly evident what kind of show I'll be getting. As a life drama, it lacked the essence of genuine human connection and eventually dipped in mediocrity trying to achieve that artificially by adopting quick, dry and cutthroat life cliches lacking nuances, depth, relevant characterization and thematic attachment. Aside from the 2 main characters, none of the side cast was interesting the slightest and clearly had the absolute minimal amount of effort put into them which is why the drama may come off as boring sometimes. Speaking of effort, the soundtrack was abysmal if you are watching it from Netflix! They clearly didn't give any attention to it and slapped in some royalty free default tracks because it's easier for Netflix to distribute it world wide. The TV version had real music and songs which is really important for a drama of this theme. Stupid Netflix as always. One more thing, the drama has this habits of sprinkling in a handful of random mini stories for the side characters that doesn't get attention for more than 2 scenes or contribute to the overall narrative in a desperate attempt to buff up the drama. The only noteworthy thing about this drama is having an elderly cast getting the spotlight which we don't see often, otherwise, it's a bland collection of life drama cliches with the occasional nice moments."
tt13885302,"I liked Song Kang in Love Alarm and Sweet Home, but even he can't save this. This show is just so boring. It's boring from the very start but as it goes on it becomes even more boring. I can't even finish the seventh episode.I don't know what it is trying to even tell, it feels like there is no story to convey. It is like watching some random 20-year-old man's life that is not interesting. The fact that he trains ballet could be interesting but him actually doing it is shown maybe a minute per episode - very weird, since the whole premise kind of revolves around it. Otherwise, there would be no plot at ALL.So, I don't understand why is this even a show. Why not show more of Song Kang dancing rather than focus on all the pointless drama that goes no where? Episodes are filled with pointless dialogue and drama. Some scenes are entertaining but rather than that, lead to no where or give any substance to the story whatsoever. I don't get the high raitings for this one. It's not an 8.8. I'd say it's one of the worst dramas of 2021 (if not the worst). The actors did a great job but other than that, the show is bland. The main character is bland and so is his love interest (though she's a good actor). I liked the grandpa but even he gets boring around the sixth or fifth episode. There is just no interesting story. Even the bully and his motives aren't clear and it feels like the writer is keeping things from the viewer, as for waiting to reveal more in the future episodes, what ends up filling episodes with pointless drama and stupid dialogue, and scenes. Who cares if the grandpa's son does not like that the grandpa does ballet!? No one!Most of this is just pointless filler but the vibe is fine. The characters are boring but work well. 5 stars for the acting (especially for Song Kang's effort). But I can't finish this.Don't watch it even if you like slow ""slice of life"" type of shows like Romance is a bonus book. You'll be disappointed."
tt13885302,"A beautiful story told in a beautiful way. I really enjoyed watching this programming regardless of my lack of interest in ballet. I thought I wouldn't enjoy it since ballet doesn't pique my interest. The acting was good, the cinematography was good, the cast was good and the directing was good. Everything was good!! Some parts were quite emotional and very well executed!!"
tt13885302,Absolutely beautiful show wih amazing casting and well written story... each episode leaves us with wanting more to warm our hearts.. simplicity is the essence of this drama and yet it touches the heart.
tt13885302,"1.) They picked the cutest old man for this roleI really almost could not finish this series because of the emotions it made me feel. I was in tears.It took me through the full spectrum: Inspiration, joy, sadness, grief, and hope. I felt a longing for family or the familial in a very visceral way.2.) They picked the cutest youngin' for the roleThere is a beautiful juxtaposition between youth and age. Being at the peak of youth and sunsetting after well after you prime. It was poetic watching the two main characters interact, feed each other, motivating each other, and the ultimate take away for me:You can learn at every stage of your life, that family/security is important, and that it is never too late to dream.10/10 recommended."
tt13885302,"Really THE best K-Drama of the year for me.It's really moving, so refreshing, and thought provoking.I cried for every episode, but I also feel so healed and encouraged by the show.It really touched some of the softest part of my heart.The first episode is a little bit slow, but it really builds the foundation well. Recommend it to everyone.Also strong shout out to amazing acting of Park In-Hwa and Song Kang! I'm surprised by Song Kang's flexibility and range of acting (plus his ballet scenes in the snow at end of EP8 is absolutely gorgeous.)"
tt13885302,"Why did I upgrade from a 9/10 to a 10/10? Because this series deserves all of it. I am still very emotional when I think of it and honestly I do not believe this Series? Movie? Could be done any better than it was. The Chemistry between the two Leads is incredible, the lessons you will learn are important! Your life will be made better and your heart will be moved when you watch this. Do not miss out!"
tt13885302,"I cannot believe how much I cried with this drama. I was probably in tears every single episode. Each of the characters has a struggle and a story of their own, and the series could not have told these stories any better than it did. Having said this, if the prospect of a depressing drama concerns you, worry not! I laughed a lot too -- deep down this drama is quite lighthearted and uplifting. The ending was also very satisfying, with all subnarratives coming to a natural resolution by the end. Definitely recommend!"
tt13885302,"The aged ""Mr. Sim"" is a loving grandfather in a touching tale about an old man's battle to fulfil his frustrated childhood ambition to learn Ballet, but Mr. Sim, in his battle to find his most cherished desires becomes an unwitting agent of change for almost e-v-e-r-y-b-o-d-y around him. The nice thing about this human drama is that no actor stands out too far from the crew, though all make a genuine contribution to presenting the audience with this sometimes sad but often heart-warming tale."
tt13885302,"This is the first Korean series I have watched. I was drawn to it because of the ballet. It turned out that there really isn't that much ballet in this drama but I kept watching because I really felt for all the characters and wanted to see what would happen to them. However, I feel that the series was too drawn out and could have been told just as successfully with fewer and shorter episodes."
tt13885302,"I usually give a longer review. However «Navillera» needs just two words... beautiful and touching. Just watch and enjoy every episode!Ps. If you shed some tears while watching, that makes your session complete."
tt13885302,"Almost immediately, the characters are introduced and from then on it is a heart wrenching story of challenge, rising from the ashes and maybe being born anew.I think it teaches us that what we love in life is far more important than what others think we need. One of the best movies I have seen in a long time."
tt0317248,"Cidade de Deus seems to have a lot of praise on the IMDb boards, and with good reason too. It simply is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary films ever made.Based on true events and characters who live in the overlooked and poverty stricken slums in the shadows of Rio de Janiero, where life expectancy doesn't reach the 30's and drug dealers are kings.The tale of the City of God, and its myriad of characters is told by Rocket, a young man who struggles to make something of his life, other than to wind up another victim of drugs or gang wars.Not only are the characters in City of God absolutely fascinating, and also very endearing, but also convincingly acted by groups of young and unknown actors. The stoies are well-told, and at times, funny, and at others, brutally shocking.The cinematic style of the film gives a nod to Tarantino, with some clever time-jumping, freeze-framing, and texts indicating another chapter of the film. In every sense, a bit of a Brazillian ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Goodfellas"", but with its own unique flavour to it.The City of God is a marvel, and a highly recommended film to watch, but not recommended for the over-sensitive or easily distressed."
tt0317248,"The film revolves around the, 'City of God,' a favela (or ghetto) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a horrifying area where drug dealers run the community, and where children killing children is not an uncommon occurrence. The story begins with the early stages of the City of God (in the 1960's) showing where many of the problems stem from- the extreme poverty, overcrowding etc. Here, in the early stages of the favela, we meet our main characters, along with the supporting cast. The story revolves mainly around two characters living in the favela, Rocket and Lil Ze, and how they take two different paths through life. Rocket's dream is to become a photographer and to escape the City of God while Lil Ze becomes a powerful gang leader and drug dealer.The film offers an unflinching look at gang life in the City of God, as it follows the favela through three decades; the 60's, 70's and 80's, and shows how violence just spirals into more violence with the disturbingly high amounts of violence in the favela, most involving teenagers and children. The direction, cinematography, and editing are all Oscar-worthy. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen- with a very visceral, jerky feel, very reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan. The editing is very frantic, which makes you feel like you are on the streets of the City of God, and the direction is flawless, seamlessly blending the many elements of the story.The film was definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. The story, the direction, the cinematography, the editing and the acting all add up to make a excellent movie that I would recommend to all. 10/10, A+Would also recommend: Bus 174 and Carandiru"
tt0317248,"Such an amazing film that deserves the accolades and acclaimed hype it's garnered. One of the best foreign language films there is and one of the best films personally seen recently, after a long time of being on my to see list but taking a while to get round to it due to being so busy and going through a difficult phase.Perhaps 'City of God' is not for everybody. It is not some audience members' idea of being entertaining, and is pretty unflinching, uncompromising and challenges the viewer. It does, with that being said, a superlative job bringing those qualities to life, and there are others, including myself, who judge films by what they set out to do rather than just wanting to be ""entertained"". There are many hugely entertaining films, while there are others that are clearly intended to be things other than entertainment and either are deep character studies, deliberate mood pieces and poignant dramas and shouldn't be denounced because of stereotypical views of what a film should be like.'City of God' is very well made, with some stunning and hard-hitting images, even if the budget is not high or enormous. It's all audaciously shot and edited with a lot of gritty atmosphere and sense of tension. The music fits well and has some haunting moments without being intrusive, while Fernando Meirelles's direction, particularly in the visual style, is superb.The story is not hard to follow, with lots of provoking thought, tension and emotion, while the action is positively explosive, frighteningly brutal and designed with a real meticulousness. In no way either does it glamorise crime and gives an unflinching view of gangland rivalry, provoking comparisons to Martin Scorsese and 'Goodfellas'.Alexandre Rodrigues and Leandro Firmino da Hora are fabulous in their roles and carry the film and their compellingly real characters adeptly.Overall, a masterwork. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0317248,"I have seen this movie only recently (2005) and it's easily one of the better foreign films I have seen. Actually, it's probably just about one of the best films I had ever seen.The characters really make this movie come alive with each of their compelling personalities shining though in the backdrop of oppressive conditions and constant violence. One thing which clearly comes to mind is ""Lil' Dice's"" ear to ear smile - so vivid and yet so ironic since he personifies pure evil.The City of God is a world you don't want to visit, it won't be featured on a post card, and it's said to be the city ignored by god himself. This movie makes you feel uncomfortable, puts you on the edge of your seat -- you are right into the middle of the City and you too are caught up in it's violent temptation. More importantly, it's about the triumph of the human spirit against all odds.This movie in effect is fast paced and hard to follow (with the added stress of subtitles over Portuguese), but it's worth it; and in fact really adds to the impetuous and impulsive undertones of the movie. In addition, the quintessential Brazilian music blending into the film like a well made Caprahina makes it feel authentic like the Italian music in the God Father.You see the flaws of these men played out in an almost fatalistic nature -- hated, greed, futility; and in it all we see ourselves, our own flaws, and our own condition."
tt0317248,"The film, directed by Fernando Meirelles, tells the story of life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, in an area known as the Cidade De Deus, the City of God.  The story is told from the narration of the young photographer, Rocket.  The different scenarios of life that make up the wider-story are presented in Pulp Fiction style chapters, complete with on-screen titles for each different story component.  The story covers all the facets of the life, charting the growth of several key members of the gangs from childhood through to young adulthood, with their transformation from young hoodlums to local drugs barons.  The final parts of the story focus on the battle within the Cidade De Deus between two different groups, when business and personal matters lead to an unavoidable confrontation.  And what a confrontation it is, although details will not be given away here.  The result is a powerful telling of life based around real-life events.Martin Scorsese seems to have a heavy influence on the direction of this picture, with many moments looking familiar to fans of the legendary American filmmaker.  Close ups, sweeping scene shots, freeze-and-zoom shots, and a frenzied handheld approach are all trademarks that will be recognisably traceable to Scorsese, having been used throughout his career. Many shots remind the viewer of Scorsese's narrative dialogue-camera relationship in Goodfellas, in which the camera was used to brilliant effect to highlight the main points in the script.  This technique is used heavily in the first twenty minutes of Cidade De Deus, with the freeze frame trick being used to introduce the story's main characters alongside the dialogue of narrator, Rocket.Throughout the film one cannot help but watch a scene and think, 'I've seen that in Raging Bull, Goodfellas, or Casino', and this may make some look less favourably on the film's direction.  However, it is not fair to consider this 'a Brazilian Goodfellas', as one critic has observed.  The story has parallels - the underlying ideas of gangsters, drugs and violence -, the direction is similar, and the story is told with narration, much like Ray Liotta's role in Scorsese's epic.  But to regard this film in terms of what styles it repeats or nods it's hat to, is to be very ignorant. Fernando Meirelles,  has done a wonderfully hypnotic job of blending the old styles, and bringing them up to date with flashy and sometimes dangerously kinetic direction and editing.  Look only to the leaving-party scene in which strobe lighting is used to extraordinary effect, almost suffocating the story below a bombardment on the visual senses.  Think of a crossover between the visual energy of the Matrix and the violence of the club scene in Bad Boys.Cidade De Deus is much more than a directorial assault on the senses.  As Raul Walsh said if you don't have a story you have nothing, and many flashy Hollywood films have fallen short in using 'ultra-modern' direction to disguise the fact that no substantial story exists underneath.  Cidade De Deus is most brilliant in that it combines directorial and editorial brilliance with a story that is almost second to none in recent times. Only the true greats manage to cater to these two needs of cinema, and this is one that does.  The direction is amazing, but not to disguise the story flaws, and the story is brilliant, but does not overwhelm directorial originality.  But simply, Cidade De Deus is a perfect film for avid fans of cinematography, and those just in search of two hours of a bloody good story.I cannot decide yet if I would consider this better than Amores Perros, but it is certainly not inferior.  The at-the-same-time stylish and brutal visuals of Amores Perros are replaced by a grittier, more hands on approach to the subject.  Whilst in Amores Perros the characters took precedent, in Cidade De Deus the location is as big a character as those who live there. As a result we get a much greater feeling of the environment in which the characters exist, and so it is perhaps easier to empathise, and/or sympathise with them.  As the official press synopsis says, Cidade De Deus is a character, but is a place not a person.  Amores Perros triumphs in creating relationships between the audience and the characters, as it concentrates for a long time on relatively few people, each of whom we grow to know and ultimately care about, which is important for the emotional impact of the film.  Cidade De Deus deals with dozens, even hundreds, of characters, and so it is only a minority that we become attached to.  This means that while the film leaves a lasting impact we are not left with the same inquisitiveness about the future for the characters that we meet in Amores Perros.  Both films leave open ends, but Cidade De Deus feels closed. Whether you consider this a good or bad thing is a matter for personal choice.Cidade De Deus is essential viewing, and is cinema at its most brilliant. It will of course feel the wrath of critics who will dwell on the almost unimaginably high body count, but there are always those who will reject violence in the movies.  In fact the violence in Cidade De Deus, even the apocalyptic ending, is not as raw and bloody as many will expect.  Blood spilling is a rare sight, and the violence rests mostly, but not always, on choreography rather than in your face bloodshed.  The result is violence, but it is often so artistic that it looks beautiful rather than deterring. Like Scorsese's Taxi Driver the violence is abhorrent, but admirable from a cinematic perspective.In short, this is a superb achievement, and is easily one of the best films of the year, and of the decade so far.  Like it's predecessors, this is the latest film to come out of South America that indicates the emergence of major new talent in filmmaking.  Hollywood beware."
tt0317248,"I knew nothing of this film before I saw it by chance in a rare Pub open screening, but boy was I glad I got the chance to take a look. I was riveted all night - I completely ignored my friends! I thought it was an awesome re-enactment of a true story - powerful, moving, raw, real - and even funny in parts. I walked away afterwards, beaming. It's rare a great film like this is made, especially these days. I gave it ten out of ten. Please see it if you can."
tt0317248,I agree with the other positive reviews here. I just saw this again after 15 years - still far exceeds anything made today when it comes to struggles of troubled youth in urban slums plagued by drugs and violence. So raw. So shocking to the system. Highly recommended!
tt0317248,"Wow, this is one of those different movies - meaning not run-of-mill by any means - and one of those which isn't pleasant to watch but one you might find yourself mesmerized by it.This also is one of those ""based on a true story"" films which makes it even more shocking, if its mostly true. The story is of the many young (pre and early-teen) criminals inhabiting an area just outside the big city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. It has the feel of a documentary with real-life street kids but is upgraded considerably by fantastic camera-work, some very innovative cinematography. In other words: stylish.Make no mistake: without that stylish look, the film might be too much of a downer. The street kids are interesting but really brutal, so be prepared. I mean, how often do you see 12-year-old killers portrayed on film? The violence, language and drug use are rough in here and what a sad comment on this social problem in Brazil, a country with a huge problem with these street gangs. Overall, a very tough but fascinating film."
tt0317248,"Li'l Zé and his gang is having fun chasing a runaway chicken in a Rio favela called the Cidade de Deus ""City of God"". The chicken comes to Rocket with his camera. Then flashbacks to the 60s tell the story of Rocket who becomes the photographer of his friends. Li'l Zé and his best friend Benny grow up to be the crime boss of the city. There's Carrot who is a criminal leader tolerated by Benny and there's Knockout Ned who turned away from crime.It is truly a new Godfather. It is the harsh brutality of the slums. It's the randomness of the world. It beats with a human heart. It's a little messy. It's visceral. The kids are played by kids. The criminals are remorseless. The amateur actors are authentic. The cinematography is terrific. The location can't get more real. It is a new crime masterpiece."
tt0317248,"I am a big fan of foreign film, because its great to see directors with different points of view than the average American director. City of God is the epitome of a great foreign film. It shows the classic struggle between right and wrong, in a brand new way. The raw directing style, coupled with a great soundtrack makes for a movie which many different kinds of people can enjoy. Weather your a Harvard intellectual or the local idiot, you can enjoy this. The vicious cycle of the gangster lifestyle is portrayed with haunting accuracy. It even forces the audience to sympathize with some of the nastiest thugs in the world. All in all, City of God is one the greatest movies of my time and each time i watch it i enjoy it more than the last."
tt0317248,"The movie deals about children and adolescent factions in the impoverished Favelas , Rio Janeiro , for 1960 and 1970 years . And it centers upon a teen who tries to leave that world by means of the photography . The final confrontation among the motley gangs for Favelas control is pretty violent and bloody . In the motion picture there are shocks , emotion , sex , violence and a little bit of social criticism . Runtime film is overlong but it's fast moving and that's why it isn't boring but it results to be enjoyable . The picture is similar other film from 1981 : ¨Pixote¨ (Hector Babenco) that was likeness in atmosphere and showing the delinquent vagrants . It's a thought-provoking and clever studio of juvenile paupers and unflinching remark at the underbelly of Rio Janeiro city , where teens and children become into burglars and assassins . The movie was not actually shot in Cidade De Deus slum as it was too dangerous ; it was shot in a neighbouring , less dangerous área . Principal actors' interpretation is outstanding , in spite of most are newcomers . All of the amateur actors were recruited from Favelas (slums) in Rio de Janeiro, and a couple of them actually lived in the Cidade de Deus (City of God) itself . Fernando Mereilles direction is awesome and stylish , he even has been hired by Hollywood to make lavish films . The motion picture had an Oscar nomination and obtained a lot of success at box office around the world . The movie is produced by Walter Salles , the best director and production manager from Brazil .The film is rated ¨R¨ for crude murders and sex and isn't apt for boys , only for old people (+18) , neither squeamish. The flick will appeal to social drama and thoughtful films lovers . Rating: 7/10. Well worth watching."
tt0317248,"I have made an effort to watch all the movies in IMDb's top 100 rated list. As of now, I'm looking for a place where the DVD for Sunset Blvd. is (currently at #30). But this movie is one of the movies I've seen that's on the list. And I find it an amazing film (currently #5 on my top 10 list). What I enjoy about this film is the visual look of the film, but also the way the director puts you in the story. At the end of the film you have become friends with just about everyone in the film, even though some of the characters are very despicable people. The violence hits you in the chest like a load of bricks sometimes, especially when you recognize that many of the kids involved in the violence are right around 10 or 11, but you also realize that this reflects the culture of the slum these kids live in.Gangster films always seem to make for good dramas (e.g. the Godfather, Goodfellas), where the culture of evil almost always triumphs as the dominant character. This film is no different, but it shows the life of children in places where bribery and corruption reigns supreme. It also shows the bravery of many of these people when even the government won't stick up for them.If you're thinking of starting to watch some foreign language films, this is a good place to start. It is a classic IMO among films made in languages besides English. I did find that the subtitles in this film were done rather poorly (they displayed on my DVD player at the wrong times and it took a few plays to figure out who was saying what.) But I think the film itself is a truly great film."
tt0317248,"This movie does not take any prisoners. Although I have not been into any ""favella"" (= ghetto) and I don't really know if the movie depicts it realistically, I do know that it is a gripping story. About kids growing up in a violent environment. Not that this movie is an action movie. It's a drama, with action scenes in it.The style and the look remind you a little bit of a documentary, just to make things scarier/real. It fully achieves it's goal. The ""actors"" (the director mostly used people who really live or lived in Brazilian ghetto) are superb too. And since the story is well written and told, there is nothing more you could wish for. Of course if watch it in it's original version and don't speak Portuguese, than you will have to read the subtitles ... but it's more than worth it (and I personally prefer it that way)"
tt0317248,"In Rio de Janeiro tensions ferment, Li'l Dice to Li'l Zé shows great intent, building on shoulders of others, those he once thought of as brothers, taking hold of pastures new with pure torment. The favela is the place where war is raged, like a prison where the disparate are caged, where the currency's narcotics, with allegiances firmly fixed, the chances are you'll never get too aged. To tell the tale our navigator is called Rocket, skirts with trouble, keeps his head below the parapet, then a camera comes to hand, a chance to break out of this land, but there are those who will impose their will with threat.Still a great piece of filmmaking."
tt0317248,"The story begins in the present days, in a barbecue party in the slum of 'Cidade de Deus', with some bandits chasing a chicken. Then, a teenager called Buscapé (Alexandre Rodrigues) tells the story of the Cidade de Deus and the main characters of the movie (Zé Pequeno, Bené, Cenoura etc.), since they were kids. This movie takes place in Cidade de Deus, a set of buildings originally built in the 60's for poor persons originated from a big flooding in Rio and from some slums. In the 60's, this area was isolated, without any infrastructure. Nowadays, with the construction boom, it is located close to Barra da Tijuca and Jacarepaguá, very valuables zones. Rio de Janeiro City is surrounded by slums, where the situation presented in the film is the reality of thousands and thousands of honest poor persons. This movie is remarkable: the screenplay, the direction, the performance of the cast, everything works perfectly. The frantic camera looks like a documentary. Today the DVD was released in Brazil, I bought it and I have just watched it with my family. I really can imagine the reaction of foreigners watching this sad side of Rio de Janeiro. It is strange, because a person who does not live in Rio probably may think that this movie exaggerates in some aspects. However, this is our reality. Lost bullets, robberies, violence is part of our day-by-day life. By the other hand, the same person may think that life in Rio 'stinks', and again it is not true. My city, like a golden coin, has two sides: heads and tails. If you can afford, you have wonderful places to live. But unfortunately, a great part of the population lives in slums, like the ones showed in this movie. The lack of perspective in life of the children, unemployment, ridiculous salaries, lack of education, lack of the faith, all of these factors contributes for the formation of the next generation of drug dealers and bandits. The traffic offers positions to the kids, like showed in this movie. And in the end, even when the 'grown-ups' are arrested or murdered, there is a bunch of children to occupy the spot. A sad social problem, but true. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Cidade de Deus"" (""City of God"")"
tt0317248,"Incredible film. Not much to say, yet I could say it all. The film is absolutely splendid in its use of colour, characters and especially music. Though some might complain of the shaky Super 16 footage, it is evidently for effect as the first half (golden age) is filmed with lots of aerials, and smooth, precise shots.Stunning in every sense"
tt0317248,"Before anyone says anything, hear me out. According to the IMDb Top 250 list, ""The Godfather"" reigns supreme as number one, while ""City of God,"" or more appropriately, ""Cidade de Deus,"" is at the number 17 slot. But to compare the two is like comparing an Arnold Schwartzenegger movie to ""Crash."" They are just too different. But for me, while Francis Ford Coppolla's 1972 film is rightly considered a masterpiece, ""City of God"" is more memorable and packs a bigger punch. That, and ""The Godfather"" has had 30 more years under its belt to gather its legendary status. And it's in English (which, sadly, makes a lot of difference).Now, ""City of God."" What a rush! Fernando Meirelles's masterpiece is a film to behold. Many critics have described films as ""explosive"" for the punch they pack, and/or the unflinching reality of the subject matter. But there has been no film I have ever seen that can match ""City of God"" for energy. It has so much energy that instead of unfolding, it throws itself at you all at once, leaving everything else to be done afterwards. The actors don't act; they don't have time. They just...are. Everything is done to such an extreme, it's surprising that Meirelles manages to make none of it sensationalistic or exploitative.Some people will tell you that this film is the chronicle of two drug lords. While there is some truth in that, the plot, if one could call it that, is better described as the chronicle of the ""City of God"" itself. Characters float in and out, with the ""out"" part frequently involving a bang (or more likely, a series of them). The characters are given background only if and when they are needed.Like I said, there's really no time to develop subtly-nuanced performances. The film moves with such breakneck energy that to do so would only slow it down. There are only a few characters that really matter. Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) is our window into the hellish slums. The result isn't voyeuristic, instead Rocket is more like a guide (albeit with only the narration addressing the audience). He's a normal teen, with interests in girls (particularly Angelica (Alice Braga)), sex, and aspirations to be a photographer. But his main goal is simply to survive each day. Also of note is Li' Ze, who we see growing up with a taste for violence as a kid (kids shoot and kill people just as frequently, if not more so, than adults). His increasingly drug-addled brain and his ambition makes him more frightening by the minute. The only one who keeps him grounded and (relatively) under control is Benny (Phellipe Haagensen), the ""coolest hood in the City of God."" There's some truth in that statement, as spoken by Rocket. He's the shed of brightness in this hellish city (though he's no goody-two-shoes). Finally, there is Lil Ze's rival, Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge), who has the film's most notable character changes.But this is Fernando Meirelles movie. He throws in everything he can think of, and then some. References to Tarantino are abound, and there are probably more, but Meirelles takes the energy level up so high that there's no room for even a ""please"" or ""thank you."" Desaturated colors. A constantly moving camera. Loud noises. An upbeat soundtrack (which is the film's saving grace from becoming too grim). It's all here.People may not agree with me that this is the best film ever made, and that's okay. I respect that. But make no mistake, it's an unforgettable 130 minutes."
tt0317248,"A no holds barred look at life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, a place that consumes many, but now and then, people escape and make good.It is an outstanding piece of cinema, I was told to watch it, that I would enjoy it, it absolutely blew me away.I would argue this film isn't for everyone, it's not a thriller of drama as such, it's too real for that, instead it's a detailed look into real life. It's not casual viewing, you need to concentrate, so ensure you have two peaceful hours to absorb it.Relentless, bleak, at times it's quite upsetting, if you're sensitive, this will leave a mark on you, several of the scenes which involve kids are quite hard to follow.Gun violence, drugs etc, it really doesn't hold back, it's graphic. The visuals for me are the film's best element, it looks terrific, it's very stylish.@The acting is terrific, especially when you consider the size of the cast, and the number of youths.10/10."
tt0317248,"Wow, what a great movie! I'd heard plenty about this low budget Brazilian gangster film before I got around to seeing it when it showed on television in the middle of the night, but I was fully prepared to be disappointed. Many times a film has been hyped up so much that it's a let down when I finally see it, but not so this one: CITY OF GOD is a tremendous film, a masterpiece in fact. In many ways it's like a lower budget, more realistic version of the classic gangster films made by the likes of Martin Scorcese and Guy Ritchie and in many places it equals the heights of those two directors at the top of their game.The film follows the misadventures of various, almost feral children as they attempt to eke out an existence and then a living as they grow up in a Rio de Janeiro slum in the '60s, '70s and '80s. The central narrator isn't a gangster at heart; all he wants is to become a photographer and yet he's caught up time and time again in the violence surrounding his drug-dealing friends. Particularly good is Leandro Firmino as Li'l Ze, a psychotic hood who becomes a gang leader and who thinks nothing of having kids executed if they dare so much as get in his way.The direction is top notch, with Fernando Meirelles employing hand cameras on more than one occasion, so that this has a vivid, on the street look to it. The editing is slick and sleek, the music fits the action perfectly, and almost every actor seems to fit his or her role like a glove. I'm trying to think of things to criticise, but there's nothing, really: the story drew me in, got me interested in finding out what happened to the characters, and before I knew it a good two and a half hours had gone by while I sat back and was lost in this film's world. Of course, it's a tremendously violent movie, unflinching in its depiction of violence against children, and one of the most hard-hitting films I've witnessed, so not for those who prefer family-friendly fare; but if you're up for it, this just might be one of the best, most realistic crime films ever made."
tt0317248,"There are certain people who have developed a very negative view towards Hollywood movies and U.S. cinema. In this mindset, any movie coming from the US is automatically lambasted, while non-US cinema is praised without merit. City of God, or Cidade de Deus, is one such case. Its serious overvaluing can only be attributed to a cloudy-eyed sentimentalism for the real situation behind the movie without even considering whether the movie itself has value in portraying that situation. And the unfortunate case is, no. Meirelles and Luns' generic directing is completely devoid of feeling and insight, and the actors are merely going through the motions, lacking any emotional impact in the actual proceeding of the screenplay. For these failings, the film collapses into a jiltingly generic mashup of violence and crime, with nothing to tell. There is no shock value, there is no empathy, there are no thoughts evoked. Perhaps this movie has some appeal and bearing to people who are more closely connected to Brazil and the kind of events portrayed, seeing as they can draw from another experience to put some weight into the matter, for this film by itself has none. It takes a special kind of pretentiousness and self-delusion to rate this film highly on its own merits, and the kind of a critic that dares not criticize a film with a sensitive subject. Yet this film desperately needs more of a voice of reason to call it for the empty shell it is."
tt0317248,"'What are you doing, you're just a kid?' ""I steal, I kill, I carry a gun, how can I be just a kid? I am a man.""Many who visit Brazil the first time, tend to view Brazilians as lacking serious ambition. They seem to party the night away, and appear to seldom work. The old joke about Brazilians is that they have breakfast at 2:00 in the afternoon.But such a narrow view does not take into account the fact that while we in America work to live, sweating away for pennies which the government steals at every turn, they in Brazil Live to Live. It is a different kind of living, a life that sambas with the vibrance of the swaying palm and the bounding drum. A life that understands that we are only on this earth for a cup of cafezinho, and we should have fun while we can before the end comes, but quick.But as the City of God also shows us, Brazilian life is often nasty, brutish and short. A certain degree of anarchy overshadows all the denizens of the film. But Director Fernando Meirelles takes a situation lacking definite boundaries and clear authority, and creates a framework, a structure, that of Gang Rule. The gang-members are not seasoned, old-time criminals like Fredo Corleone or even Tony Montana. Instead, they are a bunch of sweet-faced kids. No one is older than 25, partly because of choice, but mainly because no one lives past this age.On the surface, in this context, City of God is a coming of age story of two young people, a sort of Brazilian ""Angels With Dirty Faces.' One character escapes from the City of God, while the other succumbs to it.But when one scratches beneath, one finds the film a comment on the morally bankrupt City of God in Rio De Janeiro, and a mirror on Brazil itself. Far away from the party hopping, Travel and Leisure postcard perfect white beaches, is another world, one of marauding bands of displaced children.The most surprising thing about City of God is its references to American films. Most Brazilian films, as the films of all countries do, owe allegiance to their own particular cultural situation. Brazil owes a cultural debt to Europe (Portugal, Germany, Italy) and Africa. However, the United States has a far more distant cultural relationship to Brazil. That is where City of God triumphs to me an American film goer. It uses the chapter format made famous in Pulp Fiction and more recently, Kill Bill. It uses the familial structure present in Goodfellas. It uses the 'white-suit cool' present in Miami Vice and the Bacardi and cola ads from the preview before this very movie.The fact that City of God can be subtitled Grand Theft Auto: Sao Paolo, is not a surprise nor a mistake. The film is built like a video game in its use of random acts of violence. But the fluid perfect camera work and editing give way to a film with enormous contradictions. Contradictions as large and as vast as the noble country itself.Stylistically, the camera work does not conform to its premise as a gangster film. A gangster film never looked this good. It is as if the camera is released in the wide open beaches, and kicked around like one of Ronaldinho's headers. It starts on the sand and moves steadily across. It picks up on the story but then heads into the sun. It then leaves us, the film-viewer, with the most indelible image in years as we see Sonia Braga (A world icon and sex symbol of Brazil)'s niece, sitting on the sun-drenched coast putting her arm around another young boy. The innocence conveyed in this scene is something to behold. It literally takes your breath away.You see the slamming of different, competing themes. You see the subtlety and tranquility of the beach, smashed into scenes of battered youths dying on city streets. You see a wealth of hypnotic ambiguous images pulled together, much like the very Culture of Brazil itself."
tt0773262,"Dexter is the show I have been waiting for my whole television watching life! The complex and damaged characters, the twisted plot line and Dexter's foster dad grooming him, educating him, to make him the perfect avenger,its all so intoxicating! I am breathlessly anticipating the next episode. This show is not only well acted, with each and every main character holding my full attention, but written with such deep intensity that I find it absolutely irresistible! I really find it difficult to wait and see more of how Dex was traumatized as a child, more of Harry's lessons, more of the growing relationship with Rita, more of the ice truck killer, more forensics...More of this great show period. Kudos to all involved...this show will surely be a huge hit!"
tt0773262,"I read Lindsay's excellent books - Darkly Dreaming Dexter and Dearly Devoted Dexter - some time ago, and when I heard that there was to be a series based on the books, I was extremely excited. So much so, in fact, that I feared disappointment merely because my standards were so high.Thankfully, ""Dexter"" absolutely delivers. The show maintains the uncomfortable atmosphere of the novels with better fidelity than one could ever have expected, and Dexter (played by Hall) is all there.The visual elements from the show are stunning, to say the least. Disturbing, certainly, but more than that - fascinating. Watching the show, it's impossible to keep from finding a certain agreement in oneself for Dexter. He's a monster, and yet it's completely possible to identify with him.10 out of 10. This one has a permanent spot on my DVR."
tt0773262,"Dexter is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best shows ever created! It follows Miami PD blood splatter expert Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) as he both solves murders and commits them too. He only murders bad people who've gotten away from the law. Being a blood expert he's able to outmaneuver the police at every turn. It's a thrilling, one of a kind TV show that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. Michael C. Hall is perfect as Dexter and the rest of the supporting cast is just as fantastic! Yes, the ending was terrible but like Game of Thrones, Lost (or any other show with a bad final episode), a few bad episodes at the end doesn't spoil what an overall great show it was and that's what Dexter is...a GREAT show."
tt0773262,Dexter is easily one of my favorite tv shows of all-time and one of the few shows I can watch all the way through several times over without getting bored. It's hard for me to put into words how much I love this show. The only thing that's not good about it is the ending. The ending was pretty bad but that still doesn't take away from how good the show is overall. You should watch this show for Michael C. Hall's performance as Dexter alone. He's amazing in this. If you haven't seen this incredible show yet just make sure you give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge watch it as fast as you can. Once you start watching you won't be able to stop.
tt0773262,"Absolutely brilliant. True to Jeff Lindsay's books. The visual contrast between the darkness of Dexter's secret life and and the gloss of Miami adds an almost surreal quality. Character development is right on the money, bringing out the background slowly so one can see the development of Dexter's sociopath personality and his confusion of human behavior compared to his own. Dexter is an actor in his own life; his relationships between co-workers and his personal life are well shown in the video media. The fact that he is a blood splatter expert This is a dark work, but set in the bizarre world of life in Miami is almost believable. Developers of this series should also look to Andrew Vachss's books."
tt0773262,"This is going to be my first ever review on IMDb, there is not a day when I do not visit IMDb to check the reviews about movies or TV series that I watch, I watch lots of movies and series.For the first time in my life it happened to me that I could not sleep after watching a series. I have seen prison break, heroes and a lot other. Prison break and heroes first season was awesome. They inspired me so much that I got some tattoo's done on my body. However both these series cut loose as soon they go to the next season. Heroes was big disappointment but DEXTER.. OMG series after series it starts to make me so curious about the next episode.. damn the season 4. I just could not sleep the whole night after watching it. I spent my weekend watching the episodes back to back.To start with Dexter (Michael C. Hall) his darkness was off the edge he played the role so well that sometimes I wonder if he is the same in his real life but then I found that Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) is his real wife who is playing his sister in this series. Damn Debra is one character who is so confused and mostly been controlled by the people around her, she always end up doing something wrong but always gets credit for the good things too.I love the part when you get to know what is going on in Dexters mind when he thinks about something or when someone is talking to him also the part when he talks to his dead father Harry. (he just thinks what his dad would say in that situation). All the episodes/characters and all the seasons are written and played so well that you can hardly find any flaw in it.My favorite characters are Dexter (Quite obvious), Rita and Vince Masuka damn Vince is so funny, he just utter one word in his entire episode and comes out to be damn funny.I just cant wait for the Season 5 and I am sure whosoever watched dexter feels the same way just like I did.(Apologizes in case my first review has some mistakes and offends somebody's feelings)"
tt0773262,"Dexter, a forensics expert at day, serial killer with a touch of vigilantism at night. Dexter is creating a believable and very detailed portrait of a, lets say troubled, sociopath. One of the parts about the show I like best is the emotions that normal people exhibit, thus forcing Dexter to mimic them. Good laugh when the emotions Dexter fake get real, and he is scared out of his mind, like in the relationship with his ""girlfriend"" Rita, mother of two and victim of her abusive ex-boyfriend. Also liked the acting of Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's sister Debra, adds a nice touch colour to the show, without drifting into clichés.Thrilling story, many details, and one of the best opening sequences ever."
tt0773262,"Between Dexter and Weeds, Showtime has a corner on the original new shows market. Not only are both of these shows completely original and innovative, but they are REALLY good.Dexter, in particular, should not be reviewed by anyone who hasn't seen more than three episodes. I almost feel as if the first episode in the series is a tad-bit melodramatic (note Dexter screaming in the face of his first victim) just to pull in viewers that otherwise need something more visceral than a great screenplay.By two more episodes the viewer should be absolutely intoxicated by the complexity of the character Dexter and the acting of Michael C. Hall. His own co-stars admit to being almost ""scared"" by how well Hall absorbs his character. Personally, I think that without Hall's mastery of Dexter there would be nothing to watch. Don't get me wrong, the plot of this show is extremely intriguing (and original, to be redundant), but the excitement lies purely in the way Dexter/Hall responds to A) his girlfriend, B) blood, and C) other serial killers.I think that it is very reasonable to chuckle at Dexter's attempts to ""fit in"" social situations and I believe the writers of this show planned on it. What I am still stuck on, however, is whether or not to cheer Dexter on in his methodology (serial killing serial killers). This had better be the first of many seasons, so spread the word......Edit: I watched this series finale last night and come back to this review (which I wrote after the conclusion of Season 1) with my hat in hand to say: ""I'm kind of sorry for the hype.""If my review was the impetus for your 'Dexter' obsession (I, too, was obsessed) then I owe you an apology for the way it all ended. Sure, sure, I couldn't have known how poorly written the resolution of this once-magnificent series would be. But, you see, I shouted praises for this show from roof-tops...telling every friend who would engage me in discussion about pop-culture that they NEEDED TO WATCH DEXTER, it's the greatest drama on television!Alas, I will not leave any spoilers here and if you've come along the journey with me then you will undoubtedly watch how it all ends, but I write this edit in vain so that you, internet friend, cannot say that I didn't warn you: 'Dexter' leaves me wanting a real ending."
tt0773262,"Hard to believe that Showtime would let a piece of gold turn into a turd after four seasons, but they did. Seasons 1-4 are as good as any show I've ever seen, a solid 10, would recommend to anyone and beg them to watch. Holds up wonderfully even in 2021. Seasons 5,6,7 were not good, but had some good moments. Season 8 is as bad as you will find anywhere. Honestly think it was written by sixth graders, I was begging for it to be over - how the actors could put up with the idiocy is beyond me, but I guess they were being paid plenty by then. If you love the first four seasons, watch the next three and enjoy the characters, then read the spoilers to see how season 8 ends. It will truly leave a bad taste in your mouth if you watch the last season."
tt0773262,"What started out to be a phenomenal series, Is not ending well :(. I crack up weekly at everyone's reviews but never got irritated enough to post my own. Well 8yrs later the day has come this is by far the worst season.... OK sure it has a few highs but far more lows. I love Dex but he is turning into a whiny b**** which defeats the purpose of his original purpose. :/ So there's my rant I wont even get into the others or else I might as well right a report.Wtf is this 10 line crap I see one liners all the time????So they want us to write a whole report. Well this is my 1st review which is obvious at this point lol.So you want 10 lines here is your 10 lines."
tt0773262,"This is undoubtedly, the best ever TV Series I've watched. So addictive, thrilling and entertaining. No boredom, super-fast and it'll glued you to the screen just from the 1st minutes of the 1st episode."
tt0773262,"Although I am not a regular proponent of serial television shows, the eclectic, in-depth storyline and character development in Dexter are far beyond what I expected from Showtime or any network other than HBO. Dexter is a unique insight into the mind of a serial killer protected by his occupation as well as the lessons derived from his father's teachings. By having a resounding premise of catching a notorious serial killer while trying to conceal his own identity, Dexter enters each week with a new sociological dilemma as well as a new criminal to dispatch. What is best about Dexter is his own personal facade of trying to be normal. While other characters in the show are obviously dysfunctional, the audience are privileged to see the flaws of Dexter while people within his own world cannot. Darkly humorous, well-paced, and morbidly addictive Dexter is the best show of 2006, without a doubt."
tt0773262,"In the realm of cinematography and scriptwriting, it is advised to limit character narration allowing actions, conversations, and scenes to speak for themselves. However, if there exists an exception, and it goes by the name, Dexter!From the start, I found myself captivated by Dexter's character - a dark, introverted individual. The strength of character development was evident, bolstered by impeccable casting and an engaging, crime-filled storyline.Seasons 1 and 2 stood out exceptionally, earning a commendable rating of 9/10. However, the show's quality began to wane afterward. The introduction of new characters and excessive drama weighed down what was once a classic series. Despite my love for the character, I sensed a gradual decline in its charm, including that of Debra.The writing and direction were solid, yet Dexter himself stood as the towering centerpiece as his portrayal of dark humor remained a standout aspect. His narration throughout the episodes was a unique perspective where we learnt how he perceived things, people, and crime; it was utterly captivating.I recommend this series, but I urge viewers to approach it at their own pace and choose the number of seasons to indulge in. However, I must stress that the first two seasons are a must-watch and should not be missed."
tt0773262,"HBO Actors, HBO Directors, HBO Writers, and Showtime's willingness to take risks that HBO might not see as profitable these days (Carnivale + Deadwood R.I.P.) make for a killer combination in ""Dexter,"" the new Sho Comedy/Drama about a Serial Killer Killing Serial Killer (you read right). In my opinion, Showtime has always had a hard time producing an original series that's truly original and good, so it's incredibly refreshing to see the network pull such a ""Hail Mary"" move and come out on top. ""Dexter"" is, without spoiling anything, an excellent vehicle for Michael C. Hall, and explores the inner monologue of a Serial Killer in a way that has never been approached before without seeming too predictable or hokey. Watch it and you will not be disappointed. You'll even want to watch the next episode, which says a lot considering the network. I just hope they don't screw it up."
tt0773262,New season 2021 confirmed. They say its limited. Let's pray otherwise. I'm so excited!!!
tt0773262,"Over the past couple of years I have gone through some of TV's most followed series of recent years (Breaking Bad, Lost, Fargo, etc.). I've LOVED it: the great storylines, character progression, scenes that make your jaw literally drop. That being said, the TV series Dexter is my favorite, and it's not close. Never have I been so emotionally attached to something on the television. My mind literally correlates memories and relationships made during that time to where I was at in the series at the time. I finished the show in 4 months, and let me tell ya, it was on my mind the entire time, throughout the entirety of the day. I loathed daily responsibilities that took away Dexter's screen time (very unhealthy looking back, not that I could help it). One year after finishing the show, Dexter still crosses mind on a regular basis (one example: me writing this review at nearly 3am in the morning lol). And oh my am I looking forward to the reboot next fall!One request: please please please do not be turned off by all of the negative reviews about its ""tragic"" ending!! Everyone wanted their own perfect ending (impossible), but what the producers put together is perfectly on brand with the 8-season storyline that precedes it. I have to believe true Dexter fans understand this!"
tt0773262,"Dexter is hilarious; it is easily the best new show on TV! Dark, dry humor crops up in the most unexpected places, and the settings and dialogue are laced with CSI's pseudo-scientific appeal. While the show may appear to treat standard morality as irreverent, it is actually an excellent study of humanity at its best -- and worse.The character of Dexter, a disassociated, psychopathic serial killer, is somewhat reminiscent of Data, the android in the Star Trek series. Dexter is devoid of normal, human emotion, and has to learn behaviors by rote. Seeing the world through his eyes enables us to closely examine what is ""right"" and what is ""wrong."" We have to pause and wonder about our own perception of reality.Overall, the show is a side-splitting outlet for the vigilante/serial killer/dysfunctional being in all of us. Well done!"
tt0773262,"Having watched Dexter right to the bitter end I have to say I won't miss it at all. What was a better than average series, stylishly directed with a great cast was forgiven for being a bit repetitive. It should have ended 3 seasons ago, this last season was pathetic, it was as though the writers had been sacked, some new ones brought in and told to keep it ""ticking over"" and told to end it all in the last 2 episodes. for a show built on secrets very few were revealed, this went out with a pathetic whimper. The penultimate series built to a real dramatic high that promised so much for the final series, instead of keeping this up and pushing the characters to new extremes it was as if they were all too tired to be bothered, every character acted as if they were ready for a retirement home."
tt1856010,"The moment I heard they are gonna drop Kevin Spacey, I knew season 6 is going to lose its soul & suck hard... But they re-defined sucking in season 6...
Although it started even before that announcement when Claire Underwood broke the 4th wall and stole the intimacy between the audience and Frank Underwood... Yeah that was when all the charm and anticipation went out of the window for the next season...
This sets a new precedence where a stark contrast between season 1 & season 6 shows the greatness and ridiculousness of a good show exhibiting itself...
The ones who made the the decisions to completely ruin the legacy should be ashamed & retire...
I would love to give this show 1/10 because of season 6 but I am keeping my original rating intact for all the goodness of previous seasons...
PATHETIC..."
tt1856010,"I loved this series, Kevin Spacey made this show awesome. As soon as he was gone the show just went from brilliant to bad. The plot didn't work and the character chemistry was gone. So unfortunate - this could have been one of the most iconic tv series in history."
tt1856010,"House of Cards is about a ruthless politician (Kevin Spacy) and his wife (Robin Wright) who go to any lengths and do anything to get what they want. It really is as good as everyone says and I now understand why it won so many awards. I just watched this recently with all the free time because of the pandemic and I'm mad at myself for waiting so long. I originally gave it a try years ago but was got bored during the first few episodes so I stopped watching it, this time I powered through and next thing I knew I couldn't stop watching and binged the show pretty quickly. I do have to agree with most others here that the show dropped off a lot after Kevin Spacey left (or was fired and for good reason). It's really not even worth watching once he leaves. Spacey and Robin Wright were perfect for these roles and were both brilliant!"

I have to agree with most others here that the show dropped off a lot after Kevin Spacey left (or was fired). Spacey and Robin Wright were perfect for these roles and were both brilliant!"
tt1856010,"I love spectacular TV-shows with amazing production values like Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead, but I have to say: although House of Cards has little interest in jaw-dropping images or gruesome make-up effects, it delivers just as many dark thrills to keep you glued to your seat as the action-heavy flagships of HBO and AMC. It's a testament to the writers', directors' and actors' talents that a show which mostly consists of people talking is as much a prime candidate for binge- watching as the shows I've mentioned before, so for those of you who haven't started watching it yet, be warned: House of Cards is highly addictive.The show is based on the acclaimed BBC mini-series of the same name from 1990, but while the original show focused on the inner workings of British politics, the remake is entirely US based and concentrates on the rise of power-hungry congressman Francis Underwood who is played by Kevin Spacey. On the surface, the show might appear to be a political drama - which it certainly is - but it's also so much more than that. House of Cards combines a vast number of genres; it's a thriller, a love story, a black comedy and a satire - and a very interesting lesson in US politics, which, given creator Beau Willimon's profound knowledge on the subject (he used to work as a campaign aid for Hillary Clinton, Bill Bradley and Howard Dean), is probably a lot more accurate than what we would like to believe.It's also worth mentioning that House of Cards was heavily inspired by certain works of William Shakespeare. The character of Francis Underwood is a combination of Richard III and Macbeth, and in true Shakespeare manner, he often addresses the audience directly to inform us of his evil schemes. As in the bard's two famous plays, the villain is also the protagonist and - to a certain degree - the person you root for. And what makes him so much fun and so compelling to watch here, is - regardless what you think of him as a person - Kevin Spacey's performance. Spacey's portrayal of a charming but deadly predator is simply perfect; despite the character's obvious willingness to go to extreme lengths to get what he wants, Spacey always keeps him believable and avoids the temptation of making him appear like a caricature or as over-the-top as Richard III in the play. But many of his co-stars are just as impressive; some of them actually downright outshine the famous oscar-winner, and especially Robin Wright gives an amazing performance as Underwood's equally ambitious wife and partner in crime (yes, season 6 is a let-down, especially the final episode, but that's not Wright's fault).To sum up my overall impressions: Under the guidance of David Fincher (who serves as an executive producer on the show and also directed the first couple of episodes), Beau Willimon has developed one of the smartest and most entertaining TV-shows - with one of the most impressive casts - contemporary television has to offer. Seasons 1-5 are highly recommended.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"
tt1856010,"It's not the same without Kevin, he is one of the best actors out there and I'm so pleased to see he's got upcoming films coming out. This show is Kevin, unfortunately Robyn can't pull it off without him. A real shame too that the producers didn't back Kevin up."
tt1856010,"No way around it, Season 6 was awful ...in every respect that the first few seasons excelled this fseason 6 failed.. Preposterous and confusing storylines, awful script, poor directing, the episodes had a soap opera like energy, as the saga provided empty thrills, and culminated in the most bizarre and ridiculous finale I've ever witnessed on television.... The first few seasons were great and deserved the highest of ratings; unfortunately Season 6 was a complete waste of time."
tt1856010,"I firmly believe that one of the major aspects of what makes House of Cards so good is the ability to watch all the episodes back-to-back with no commercials or programming schedules to get in the way. This small but hugely significant idea will be an industry game changer and I am certain that this is just the beginningTo me, the biggest advantage that this idea contributes to House of Cards is that it frees up significant time during episodes because it makes things like flashbacks or repeats of events almost completely redundant. There's simply no need for them because everything is so fresh in your mind, which leaves all that extra time for more story, more action, more conspiracy, more drama, more of the stuff that viewers really want to see. However it must be said that it does take a few episodes to get used to this, and you have to be really switched on and completely focused to ensure you don't miss a beat, because you really will pay a price if you do because what's said is never repeated, only referenced further down the trackAs for the show itself, I can't sum it up any better than by saying it's incredibly good to watch. The one aspect of the show I enjoy the most is the monologue, or removal of the fourth wall, between the viewer and Underwood. It's an incredibly effective method of storytelling as well as the expression of emotion or opinion, and Kevin Spacey does a superb job at pulling it off, along with every other aspect of his complex and intriguing character.The quality of writing, directing, and storytelling is as good as you'll ever see on the best shows in the world right now. Underwood has a massive ship to steer, and it is fascinating watching how he does it, through manipulation, blackmail, greed and determination. Each and every character has a critical role to play - there's no characters you could cast aside as being irrelevant or unnecessary to the story. That is a very difficult feat to achieve, and House of Cards easily passes that testIf you're going to pioneer something, like Netflix have with how viewers can watch House of Cards, you have to do it well. Everything has to be perfect, otherwise it will flop. A top quality show in House of Cards coupled with the worlds best internet streaming service is a very very good place to start. Netflix and the House of Cards team deserve a huge round of applause for daring to go places where no one has gone before. The $100 million gamble has definitely paid off, and I cannot wait for moreNeedless to say, House of Cards earns a 10/10 rating, and an absolute must-watch from me"
tt1856010,"This series was an exceptional political thriller, until Robin Wright destroyed the last season. This series didn't work without Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood. I gave this a 10 for the seasons Frank Underwood was the lead."
tt1856010,"There should be a petition to reshoot s06 now Spacey has been cleared of any wrongdoing. The 6th season was already written with Sir Spacey as the main character. Netflix owes all the fans of this show some closure. I have refused to watch the 6th season for years now, waiting for the real life trial. One of the greatest actor in history was outcasted without a trail. Now 6 years, 2 presidents and a couple of wars later the fans deserve some closure. How many Netflix subscriptions were bought because of house of cards? Spacey was not the first and will not be the last victim of Netflix their cancel culture, it is time to right a wrong!"
tt1856010,"I've reviewed all the episodes for Season 6 but feel the need to respond to the entire season. There were moments where I felt engaged because of the clashes of evil that took place here. With the exception of the press people, I can't think of a single person I could admire. I know politics is often corrupt, but without Frank's leading us through his various enterprises. Claire is a psychopath, not much different from Doug, and the two of them basically cancel each other out. The sad thing is that I don't care what happens to them. Finally, I wonder how much fun this season would have been if Spacey hadn't screwed up. Claire's posturing throughout is really tiresome. She's sort of Lady Macbeth. She's sort of Cersei from ""Game of Thrones."" But what is missing is a developed plot. I still don't know what she wanted. Was it power or a godhead or what. Or was it just to punish men. This whole thing was a mess."
tt1856010,Simply not worth it anymore after Kevin Spacey left... the series lost all heart and soul...
tt1856010,"I cannot recall ever watching a series ending in such a horrible manner. The plot was confusing and the entire storyline was ridiculous. How they drew this nonsense on for eight shows was amazing. The annoying background music throughout the entire series may the watching of this disaster even worse. My advice, watch Seasons 1-5 and then walk away."
tt1856010,"I enjoyed every bit of HOC 1-5.. Both the lead actors and the supporting cast were excellent.. Season 6 is Dull as Ditchwater.. A painful watch.. If they did this so that the hundreds of workers on the show wouldn't lose their jobs that's sad.. The show which IMHO was the shining star of the Netflix stable has crashed and burned.. Robin Wright is a great actress but without Kevin Spacey, her acting is insipid and boring to say the least.. For HOC fans, stay with the happy memories of Seasons 1-5.this leaves a bitter aftertaste"
tt1856010,"Frank Underwood is what this show was all about. Its a sin to imagine this show without Kevin Spacey... Netflix, you destroyed such a wonderful show.."
tt1856010,"When I thought about Francis Urquhart of the original House of Cards series, I could not help but imagine Kevin Spacey in a way that was similar but a role of his own making. Spacey's role of Francis Underwood, in Netflix's original series, is nothing short of a tour de force. The convenience of being able to watch the whole season right away is also something to mention as a new, fresh and exciting method of television excellence. No longer do we have to wait and be fed slowly the episodes as we wonder what might happen and find ourselves somewhat disappointed -- now we can be swept away. And that's exactly what will happen to you when you sit down to watch this. 13/10."
tt1856010,"This is one of the best shows; excellent story, good script, exceptional acting by everyone, and good cinematography. The fifth season was a bit slow, but, what's disappointing is Spacey's departure (removal, rather) from the show. No matter how good the others were, Spacey is what made this show perfect. Without him, there is no way the show can survive. The series has ended for me."
tt1856010,"If television series were ships, then ""House of Cards"" is without a doubt The Titanic. Both had their origins in the U. K. Both were launched amid much fanfare and had an amazing and fruitful beginning and middle run. And both slammed into an iceberg and ended in disaster! Of course this proverbial iceberg for ""House of Cards"" is Season 6.It's sad to see how Netflix likes to launch amazingly popular and brilliant series only to stab them to death or just dump them far too soon. And, in the case of ""House of Cards"", it was because of the ""Cancel Culture"" bullcrap that is spreading like a cancer throughout our society.Fortunately, seasons 1 through 5 can stand on their own, and they are a worthwhile watch. Kevin Spacey is one of the most talented actors out there, and what he did or didn't do 3 decades ago really doesn't matter. He made and carried ""House of Cards"", and without him, the show became pointless.Enjoy the first 5 seasons. Then move on.N. B. The 9/10 review is for Seasons 1 through 5 only.!"
tt1856010,"I was so looking forward to this, having been a big fan of the original BBC series, with its masterful central performance by Ian Richardson. In fact when I logged in to Netflix (like a lot of people, this show is my sign-up moment), I realised that my expectation level was really high.Within the first 30 seconds, Kevin Spacey's character Frank Underwood has killed something- in this case dispatching an unfortunate dog which has been hit by a hit and run driver. And as the political intrigue starts to develop around him, Spacey just fills the screen. By the end of the first episode, it isn't so much that you have forgotten Ian Richardson as Urqhuart, Underwood's British cousin, but realised that Spacey is taking us somewhere different. With Francis Urqhuart you got the impression he was always a psychopath, waiting for the trigger to start his Macchiavellian and murderous rise. Underwood seems to be just a more clever, more ruthless and less hypocritical politician than those around him. The fundamentals of the show - the scorned and bitter political back room fixer, the Lady Macbeth figure of Francis' wife, the ambitious young woman journalist, but all updated.Mrs Underwood is no Tory wife, waiting ""in the country"" while her husband charts his rise to power. She is the one giving him the backbone to do it. And as we see her brutally wielding the axe at the charity in which she works, it becomes clear she is no slouch in the ruthlessness stakes herself.The character of Zoe Barnes, the young reporter, is in a lot of ways more rounded than Matty Storin in the British version. Here she is ballsy, ambitious and a bit ruthless herself. While she retains the innocence of the character, she gives the impression she thinks she knows what she is doing. Which will make later episodes much more juicy as she realises she is way over her head.The show is shot beautifully, as you'd expect from the calibre of the team behind it, and the production values are excellent. Supporting roles are great. It looks like a movie or The West Wing before they ran out of money.But the undisputed joy of this series is Spacey, who is a more world-weary, more cynical Francis, and who is setting about his task of revenge and ambition much like he destroyed the unlucky dog at the start of episode 1: its an unpleasant task but someone has to do it.Spacey is every bit as good as Ian Richardson in this show and Netflix's big gamble deserves to pay off."
tt1856010,"Just watched the first episode. It is outstanding in every sense of the word. Fist of all I'd like to say, Kevin Spacey is amazing. He's not the dull politician we're used to seeing, he's a deeply written character with nuances to his actions and speaking. You can definitely see Fincher's style in the first episode, at least. It contains some of the similar themes he has tackled before in his film and adds to those. He crafts the story very tightly woven and complex. Kate Mara is also great, she adds to the list of modern Fincher characters. I love the points of satire in Spacey's character and some of the symbolism used. The show is outstanding in every aspect, unlike a lot of other political dramas on TV, can't wait to watch the next episodes.Definitely a must watch for any fan of TV or Fincher or anyone interested in this."
tt1856010,"Fans of David Fincher and Kevin Spacey have been eagerly looking forward to House of Cards. Not only is this an opportunity to see an elite Hollywood director and actor take on a new medium, but it represents Netflix's first attempt at original programming (I guess Lilyhammer came first, but House of Cards is a much bigger investment for Netflix). The CEO of Netflix has said that House of Cards is meant to be a show on the quality level of the top cable stations, such as HBO, and the final product delivers on this promise.House of Cards follows several characters involved in the political scene in Washington D.C., including politicians of various rank and influence (Kevin Spacey is a House Majority Whip in the House of Representatives) and an upcoming reporter played brilliantly by Kate Mara, who you may recognize from the first season of American Horror Story. The cast in uniformly excellent and thrives under Fincher's direction. Occasionally, Kevin Spacey's character will talk directly to the camera and offer some narration, which is the only area where the show stumbles, but it isn't too distracting. Speaking of Fincher's direction, it shouldn't come as any surprise to know that House of Cards looks great. The atmosphere is moody and resembles a tone somewhere between The Game and The Social Network. The music is equally good, complementing the mood of the show without becoming overbearing. Being a political drama, one could be understandably weary of taking the plunge into a 13 episode season if they don't find politics interesting, but that shouldn't be a concern. The writing is sharp, engaging and clear, and the characters are interesting and well developed. The editing helps: it is tight and keeps the plot moving briskly, making the political intrigue both exciting and easy to follow. Netflix has really created something impressive with House of Cards. When hearing that an online streaming service was creating an original show, some may have been concerned that it would be cheap looking and generally not on par with what AMC, FX, Showtime, and HBO are offering. Well, Netflix got some talented people and gave them the money to make something good, and the product speaks for itself. House of Cards comes highly recommended."
tt1856010,"Worth watching for the performance of Kevin Spacey and the dynamics between him and Robin Wright. Very good stories overall, you do not even have to like or know politics. But please do not watch s6 it's not even worth daytime tv."
tt1856010,"'House of Cards' much of the time was one of the most compelling shows. Sadly, it has also become one of the most frustrating. Not since 'Once Upon a Time' and 'The Walking Dead', and before that 'Lost' has such a brilliant show of great promise declined so rapidly.Lets start with the many great things first. For the first four seasons, 'House of Cards' was seriously addictive, must-watch television and very quickly became one of my favourite shows. Throughout its run, it's one of the most stylish and most atmospheric shows personally seen, with cinematic-quality photography and production design. The direction was smart and intelligent, especially the first two episodes with David Fincher's, to me one of the better directors of the last twenty five or so years, involvement (the first episode earning Fincher a Primetime Emmy) and the music knew when to have presence and when to tone things down to let the dialogue and characters properly speak.Also smart is the writing. Biting, thought-provoking and tightly structured, the writing in Seasons 1 to 4 was an example to all television. The political elements were intriguing and not heavy-handed, a problem so common in film but avoided in 'House of Cards'. The stories didn't go at a ""fast"" pace but it never dragged in the show's prime days, and they were also very layered, had variety and were suitably complex without being convoluted.The characters engaged and intrigued, Frank being another example of one of contemporary television's most fascinating lead characters. 'House of Cards' throughout has been so strongly acted, with Kevin Spacey on tour-De-force form and Robin Wright giving career-best work.So it just feels incredibly frustrating that a show of such brilliance in its prime declined so rapidly in Season 5, to the extent that it feels like a completely different show altogether. The production values and acting have remained top notch, but even they can't save the show being the complete anti-thesis of what it used to be.Pace became incredibly draggy, thanks to flabby writing, simplistic characterisation that is suggestive of the writers not knowing what to do to progress the characters and stories that have become repetitive, both devoid of complexity and confused, ridiculous and like the writers have run out of ideas.It to me was no surprise when it was announced that Season 6 would be 'House of Cards' last season, but it is somewhat saddening that production has now been suspended/cancelled following the Kevin Spacey sexual assault allegations that have now cost Spacey his future on the show (and done serious damage to his career). Season 5 cried out for another season, so that the show has ended on an incomplete note because of the controversy is a real pity, despite Season 5 being such a disappointment 'House of Cards' as an overall show deserves better than that.Overall, brilliant for the first four seasons but Season 5 was so disappointing, enough to bring down the rating considerably. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
tt1856010,How do you go from 10 to zero in sixty seconds? Kevin Spacey WAS the show. You should have just cancelled if you wouldn't bring him back! So I guess he really wasn't acting after all?
tt1877368,"I've loved most of the British shows that have made it across the water, and this one is exceptional! I love that they don't have disguised 'professional' bakers, just people who love this as a hobby; they do this as a true 'labor of love'!Another aspect is the judging. They don't hide catty commentary or mean-spirited comebacks in the 'helpful' comments they give, they're honestly decent in their feedback and don't make 'authoritarian' statements such as 'this is wrong' when it comes to the taste of an item. Rather, they might say 'I'm not as keen on (whatever), but the design is lovely'.Such a nice diversion from the 'reality' food shows in America! Pay attention Food Network execs!!"
tt1877368,"Unlike typical American shows where the chefs are at each other's throats, screaming, fighting, competing in stupid challenges, this is just calm and relaxing. They all respect each other, the hosts actually know what they are talking about (Masterclass), and it's a simple concept. Three challenges and a clock, that's it."
tt1877368,"Yep, 9 stars for a cooking show! Even I'm surprised at that. Thank you Netflix for bringing 4 seasons (series) to your U.S. audience. Please bring us more! I would love to see every episode since its inception. I had no idea Brits take their baking so seriously so this was a real eye opener. The variety of bakery items and the wide range of genuine talent among hobbyist home bakers is truly astonishing. This show has wonderful personalities in key roles, plus the contestants present us with their unflapable, always polite demeanor, along with a good deal of humor as they deal with the nerve wracking stress of their tasks. The contestants are all so engaging that it's hard for the viewer to pick a favorite from show to show. One contestant in the U.S. Series 3, Ian, could have his own tv show, he was that entertaining. Be prepared to get a craving for something sweet when you watch this."
tt1877368,"Thanks to our English friends across the pond for creating this show! It's a fun and serious show, but the people always treat each other with respect and kindness (of course this no longer happens on American television shows). Me and my wife seriously love to watch it. It's slowly becoming a dream of mine to become a guest on this show :-)"
tt1877368,"I love watching this show! I like that everyone is being treated respectfully and they're not trying to make a drama out of contestants' personal lives or try to up the pressure with stressful music, meanness or shouting or things like that."
tt1877368,Each season a group of lovely human beings gather under the tent to bake their hearts out. Everything about this show is wholesome and kind. Love everything about it!
tt1877368,"American here, a wonderful calm show. Comparing the show to the different American versions this is so much better. The contestants are just regular people and don't look like a casting director walked into a modeling agency asking 'who likes to bake.' There's no schtick with the contestants personalities, they are who they are and production doesn't force some ridiculous image on them to carry through a season. The judges aren't yelling at anyone but giving helpful advice. I LOVE the Technical Challenge where they get scant information and figure it out. I don't think the show needs a host much less TWO hosts who don't add anything and they aren't funny at all. No offense, they're just not needed. All in all a great show, so pleasant and the natural friendliness isn't forced."
tt1877368,"I love this show, I've watched it from the beginning. It was a little hard to get used to Prue Leith after watching Mary Berry for so long and I still miss Sue, Mel and Sandy but I really like Noel. But I'm sorry, Matt Lucas is just horrible! He's not funny, half the time his jokes are crude and insulting. Hopefully when the 2021 season airs, they will have someone else. He tries to talk over Noel and is just infuriating! I don't know who the idea he would be good, but they were so wrong."
tt1877368,"American here. This show is fantastic. Watching through Netflix, and confused by the series being out of order...I think(?!) I also find Sue and Mary HI-larious! I adore all four of the hosts/judges and their dynamic. Absolute perfection! Lastly, I find it laughably ridiculous that some reviewers below found themselves ""put off"" by the one or two times a person on the show may have made an unflattering comment about the U.S.A. Get. Over. Yourselves. It's a T.V. show. It's entertainment. As an unaffiliated, moderate-leaning, 30-something-year-old, hetero, female, 1st-generation-college-goer, Democratic, cat-owner (because I know some folks like to keep track of their stereotypes and labels) I do declare, ""To all 'snowflakes;' if the art offends thee, don't look at said art."""
tt1877368,I've watched TGBBS since it was first made available to the US audience as the Great British Bake Off. I look forward to each new season. I've even gone back to rewatch past seasons. Matt Lucas is neither funny nor entertaining. He's downright annoying and unwatchable.
tt1877368,"The good for me: The baking element of the show is good and I enjoy that these are home bakers. It is nice to see 3 different rounds of skill challenges that focus on different aspects of the baker's abilities. The show seems to have a well-rounded variety of tasks that make it interesting to watch and instructional. The bad for me: Why can't the hosts just host? As an American watching this show, it is appalling when the hosts seem to only be able to make crude jokes about sex, genitalia, and the like. It's a baking show. If that's the best you can do for hosting then find hosts with some talent for crying out loud. Maybe the hosts could ask questions that focus a little more on the contestants or some history on the desserts or the challenges but the vulgarity is absurd. I would never watch this baking show with my children, which is quite sad."
tt1877368,"Love this show. I will probably always love this show BUT Matt Lucas is not a good fit. The problem is the addition of Matt Lukas (who isn't quite as funny as he may think he is) forces Noel to play the ""straight man"" and that is not a good role for him. Sandy was a much better ying to Noel's yang. Still love the show, just not as much."
tt1877368,"It is absolutely amazing! I don't have much else to say other than it's one of the best shows on TV!You can get very attached to it and the contestants because many of them have such amazing personalities and its just great seeing all their amazing bakes. They're all so creative and look amazing! It's just an amazing show overall, it was a great idea and it's one of my favorite shows in the whole world!The presenters are funny and they know what they're talking about. This show cheers me up a lot, it makes me very very very very hungry!I definitely recommend this to everyone, of all ages! It's suitable for everyone and it makes you smile on gloomy days. I wish i could make such amazing bakes like many of the contestants!"
tt1877368,"This is such a great baking show. I loved it most when Sue and Mel were the presenters. When Noel and Sandi took over, they grew on me and I continued to enjoy the show. But I just cannot enjoy when Matt Lucas is on camera. He is simply not funny. In fact he is cringingly uncomfortable to watch as he interacts with the bakers. His comments are most often childish and inane. You can see the discomfort from some of the bakers as well when he is talking with them and their laughs are politely forced. Why they kept him on for a second season I cannot fathom. I am sure he is a nice guy, but he doesn't fit here and I hope if this show comes back for another season next year (fingers crossed!) they part ways with Matt and get someone funnier and better suited to this show."
tt1877368,"I was impelled to write a review in an attempt to drown out the homophobe and the rabid nationalist at the bottom of the reviews; pay no heed, this show is a wonderful celebration of talent, hard work and artistry from all kinds of skilled but novice bakers. I am enjoying the new hosts and mentors, although I do miss Mary."
tt1877368,"I've been watching since the beginning. Original hosts Sue and Mel were terrific. Good friends chemistry, they were empathetic and kind to the contestants. When they left, Sandy and Noel came in. Loved Sandy but Noel irritates me. Sadly, Sandy left and Matt came in. Noel ramped up his in-your-face chats with contestants and has gotten way too handy. He's made contestants lose valuable time by constantly indulging in long, silly rambling conversations. His creepy faces to the camera are ridiculous. Matt is slightly better but not up to past standards. Bring in some hosts who aren't as attention-seeking as these two guys! Loved Mary, love Prue, and of course, the big guy with a steely demeanor and soft heart, Paul."
tt1877368,"The contestants are excellent, giving their best each week. They are real people, real lives, makes it great to watch successes and great breaking losses. Paul and Pru are terrific judges, offering encouragement while seeing very high professional standards.The only thing that detracts is Noel Fielding's poor attempts at comedy. This 2020 season has devolved into cruder and cruder innuendos. Here comes across more and more as a predatory old man. Disgusting!"
tt1877368,"Paul Hollywood needs to stay out of the contestants' heads, especially when it is obvious that some of the bakers have self esteem issues. Also, the tents need air conditioning. It's bad enough the bakers have to deal with hot weather; seeing chocolate creations melt or cakes fall due to the heat is pathetic. The producers should have enough money to get fans in the tents. Finally, contestants with long hair should wear hairnets. They continually touch their hair, then touch the food. Or those with long hair actually wind up brushing the food when they bend over. All things considered, it's an entertaining program and it's touching to see most of the contestants supporting each other."
tt1877368,"Not so much this season. I love British tv, and in years past this show is amazing and entertaining, but this year it's a bit of a dud. The judges and presenters are still fun to watch, but the bakers this season don't seem to be as talented, and the bakes haven't been very good. As popular as the show is, you'd think the show would have it's choice of fabulous UK bakers and all the contestants would be outstanding. This season makes me now wonder what their criteria is for contestant selection. Nothing else to say except I may not be interested in watching next season if it continues to.recruit mediocre talent."
tt1877368,"It is just me, or are the hosts of this show becoming more and more irritating as the years go by? Having just binged seasons 6, 7 and 8, I can say for certain that not one word out of their mouths did I find funny or interesting. They are clearly there to distract and annoy the contestants, which it is clear they do. And they annoy me! Never have I used the 10-sec-forward button so much. Skip the lame hosts and false drama and get straight to the final products and the judging, which are always interesting.The things that make the GBBS charming are still there--friendly, supportive contestants, bucolic setting with cutaways to baby ducks and butterflies, interesting and sometimes bizarre challenges, doing it all for a cakeplate, etc. But the hosts are killing the show."
tt1983079,"I have to say I am a bit of a BBC miniseries junkie. So, I am always looking for a new world to jump into. I have to say that ""Call the Midwife"" is one of the best series I have seen. I am enchanted by the young girls and their commitment to caring for their community. And what makes it even more perfect is that they work alongside nuns and can see the world through their eyes. I watch this show over and over again hoping to be dazzled once again (and I always am). I don't know how accurate it is (I have not studied the time), but I do think it is a fantastic commentary on poverty, the role of women, and social class differences. If this were only a drama I wouldn't watch it again and again. But the humor (CHUMMY!!) and the light hearted moments among the business of birth is perfect! Truly, I would love to drop myself into that time and live simply where my only goal was to help women and love people well. You will thoroughly enjoy this show it sisterhood, faith, love, and courage interest you."
tt1983079,"If you want history at its truth, watch a documentary. As entertainment this show has it all. Every episode has had me in tears from either laughter or poignancy. The casting is perfect and beautifully shot. It really shows the diverse community that has embedded itself in our culture today. Who cares if the docks were not in the right place! The show is about people coming together in tough times and bonding with a community regardless of class and colour. It makes me yearn for that kind of spirit in todays world where everyone has so much and yet is never satisfied. I really hope the BBC invest in a new series - I already miss Miranda!"
tt1983079,"Whether or not this series' depiction of the East End in the 50's is completely accurate or not seems of little relevance to me. The characters are very likable and the acting, even by the guest actors, is brilliant. However, the main reason I love and wholeheartedly recommend Call the Midwife is because it is so well written, without avoiding the harsh realities of life yet filled with hope and incredible human connection. Miraculously, it manages this without ever becoming cheesy. Every episode leaves me feeling proud to be a human being. I don't think many TV series are able or even try to achieve this and it feels especially important in our times when faith in humanity seems to be in decline."
tt1983079,"As I was a student nurse in the East End of London during the mid fifties,(now an ex-pat living in Mexico) this series brings back many memories. I'm glad that some episodes include general nursing and even male patients as well as midwifery. Perhaps doctors were not always as good as the nurses in those days.I even remember an anaesthetist who sat doing his crossword puzzles during operations and no one dared utter a word of reproach.Now that the East End is suddenly fashionable, even Shoreditch and Brick Lane, what has happened to Wapping where I trained and which used to be so scruffy?One thing has changed for the better. In those far off days when a woman was admitted with an attempted abortion, euphemistically called ""incomplete abortion"", the police had to be notified and a policewoman would sit by the bed (drinking tea with the night nurse) until the unfortunate patient (who probably already had half a dozen children at least) was well enough to be arrested."
tt1983079,"**UPDATE AFTER SEASON 6: If I could mark 11 stars, that would be it. The episodes about the Thalidomide children were hard but very well focused and treated. I am intrigued at how they film the scenes with just born babies in the very hands of the actors, with wide shots, not just close-ups. Call the Midwife is a most humanistic show indeed, focused on believable, realistic positive values. In a time when humanism seems to be disgraced and devalued everywhere, it is most welcome in my screen.***This show is extraordinary.It portrays so vividly the changes of an era in Great Britain, when the latter half of the 20th century blasted into people's daily lives at poor East End London, with all its hopes, marvels, progress, and shifts from a traditional to a modern lifestyle.The performances are brilliant; the characters are as lovable as well-written; the atmosphere is perfectly recreated, and though quite serious health and social issues are crudely shown along the episodes, the tone is always permeated with hope, love and joy of living.We do not come from a Christian upbringing, and I am not a Catholic, but I strongly sympathize with the humanistic and sensible approach of Nonnatus House's team of nuns and midwives, where tolerance, acceptance and care for life ranks higher than dogma or empty beliefs.It is very hard to write a really deep, philosophical and poetic show while maintaining a light-hearted spirit and lots of humour, and Call the Midwife really makes it in a masterly way.I have to say it gets better and better as the seasons pass, always intertwining the main characters' personal stories and individual cases with relevant and updated issues of public health and bioethics.By the way, the admirable British public health system, which made wonders in the 50s and 60s and promoted equal access to safety, well-being and human development, also becomes a magnificent political statement in our own age, all the more appreciated in a retrospective look.There is nothing to complain about of this show, which exerts an honest, compelling, deeply satisfying magnetism on viewers.For those of us who love motherhood, babies and pregnancies, there is the unique plus of rejoicing at the sight of so many just born babies at the moment of delivery, in a remarkably natural and non-sensationalist feat of cinematography. You can feel the unmistakable miracle of life in each episode, with its sufferings and joys, which is so unusual among a current TV grid full of violence, special effects, overt sex, glorified evil and frenzied action.Kudos to BBC! Yes, they have made it again, once more!"
tt1983079,"This is one of the most beautiful shows I've ever watched. The writing and acting are both superb, and the incredible stories take us on a journey to show us the true meaning LOVE. Do people with this much compassion actually exist? They do, and Call the Midwife reminds us of that.This show epitomizes acceptance, patience, and perspective. It's the unconditional love and nonjudgemental views of the characters that make your heart swell while you watch.I'm rewatching and this time with my 13 year old daughter. I recommend the show to all my friends and get excited when they tell me they've started."
tt1983079,"Obviously I am a man, and will say without any hesitation that we are hooked on this series! My wife and I are best friends and there is nothing more we enjoy than finding a good British series to immerse ourselves together. We have done this for many years, initially finding them in our travels to Britain, and find that British shows seem to ""out weigh"" our American television on many levels.The subject matter is really unique and absorbing and the acting superb! The complexity of the characters and their interaction, the humor, the secrets, the context, and the weight and undercurrents of its gracious messages have impacted us and continue to do so.So many times it seems that these British series don't last and are canceled just as we are dedicated to them. It is rewarding to see ""Call the Midwife"" continuing on and we hope it does so for many years to come. We will continue to be fans as long as ""Call the Midwife"" lives!"
tt1983079,"I recently found this series on Netflix and instantly fell in love with it. I have never read the books, so I have nothing else to go by. The characters are fabulous. The actors/actresses are amazing. I think every episode has made me both laugh and cry, and I'm looking forward to more! Some of the episodes can be hard to watch, especially since I am pregnant, and I think that anyone feeling overly anxious about their pregnancy may want to hold off watching this series, because it really shows the good, the bad, and the ugly sides of pregnancy and child birth.I found one major goof that had me laughing: In one episode they mention knitting blanket squares, and people are shown knitting them. When assembling the squares to make a blanket what they actually have are crocheted granny squares."
tt1983079,"It's hard to believe that anyone could be as compassionate and tender as the midwives in Call the Midwife, compassion and tenderness being rare qualities in the increasingly disconnected world of the 21st century. I suspect those qualities are a real incentive for even the casual viewer of this series, which depicts the lives of midwives toiling in the east London of the late 50s- early 1960s. The world of almost 60 years ago was a very different one from today, both from a social and technological standpoint. I'm impressed by the attention to detail in the series, which allows viewers to immerse themselves in the stories, which touch upon issues such as abortion and incest, as well as the then real threats of polio and tuberculosis. More recent stories have even addressed the thalidomide tragedy. The acting is, without exception, top notch, especially that of Judy Parfitt as Sister Monica Joan. I tend to be especially critical of shows that rely on lachrymose sentimentality to further the story. Call the Midwife is at times tender, sweet tempered and, well, nice, but never false as it displays the panorama of the human condition."
tt1983079,"You do have to admire this series for surviving for nine seasons now (2020) - and don't get me wrong, I love the fantastic sets, locations, costumes, and little period details. Not to mention the great topics that each episode brings up, related to midwives working in the 1950s and 1960s in the East End of London. The acting is great, although Sister Julienne and Sister Monica Joan, Trixie the nurse and the doctor are possibly the only original characters. In the beginning, the series tried to make births look realistic, with a bit of blood and babies not being born freshly washed. Those scenes are less realistic these days. But lately two things have bothered me. Firstly, the penchant for happy endings. It doesn't matter if there's a woman considering an abortion or a baby born with a birth defect or a disabled boy sent to an orphanage - everything has to turn out rosy in the end. No one has to live with an incurable disease because there's no cure. If someone suffers racism, there are hordes of people to treat them nicely and to strike back. The writers ignore how in the real world, unpleasant things happened to people and sometimes there isn't a happy ending or cure. The other thing I hate is that treacly, apple pie language. The midwives all talk as though they're reading a very crisp British children's book of the 1960s. They don't swear, they always behave impeccably and never do or say anything sly or dishonest. No one is that perfect. I really hate the continuing Vanessa Redgrave voiceover at the start and the end of each episode, too. But this series has been up and down, so my next review might be a better one."
tt1983079,"I was a schoolchild in London in 1957, so I watched this programme expecting to see the London I remember recreated. I had to go to school on the tube and underground. I was from north London, but quite a few of my school friends came from East London. When I went to tea with them after school, their homes were clean and perfectly respectable. One thing I do remember though, was the warehouses and the docks were strictly out of bounds, although we could, and did, play on the bomb sites. I still have friends who were brought up in East London in the 1950s. I think this series is based on the exceptional cases rather than the normal ones. Certainly there were homes in the area, which had survived the bombing and had outside toilets and tin baths. In my experience, my friends' Mums kept their flats immaculately clean inside. The, houses, warehouses and the dock walls were all blackened with soot from the railways. 1957 was before the clean air act and fogs and smogs were common. It was good to see people getting about by bicycle, cars were few in the 1950s and mostly black saloons. I don't remember meeting or seeing any exceptionally large families. All the friends and family I had and now have, who were born and brought up in east London, are either only children, or have one or two siblings. I will watch the rest of the series with interest."
tt1983079,"I was such a fan in the beginning. Story lines that shed light on post WWII London and it's poverty and need for healing. The characters were interesting. But as the new seasons have unfolded, the writers have failed to replicate the magic of the season before. I miss Chummy, Sister Evangelina, Tom and Barbara and even young Jenny. Running out of stories, perhaps? And now, their attempts to film under Covid-19 restrictions are resulting in lack of chemistry among cast members, underdeveloped stories, and an odd draggy pace to the dialogue. Has this series run it's course? Possibly. Maybe it's time for the final curtain."
tt1983079,"Probably the worst season so far. Bringing up a lot of issues that is more relatable to modern day than 1964. My Mum lived in the neighbouring borough but had friends who were under Tower Hamlets care, and had three kids in the 60's and half of what has been brought up this season wasn't around then, cervical screening for one (my mum had no clue about this until the mid-70's) midwives, especially nuns had little to no sympathy for women who had back street abortions and would show it and unmarried mothers, a rarity, something she didn't come across at all. The program used to be entertaining, but now it's just dull."
tt1983079,"This is one of the best shows on tv. I discovered it two years ago while watching a Masterpiece presentation. Haven't missed an episode since. I prefer shows like The Americans, The Walking Dead, Fargo, etc. but this one struck a chord somewhere in the depths of my psyche and I instantly liked the stories, the scenery of 1960's London and all of the characters. This is television at its best.An update, my favorite tv night is watching Call the Midwife and Billions back to back. That pretty much covers humanity from A to Z. Writers on both shows deserve A+'s and the actors do too. Keep 'em coming and I'll keep watching."
tt1983079,"I would have scored 10 for this series, except for the fact that it doesn't truly follow the accounts written in the book from which it is taken.Some of the diversions from the book are to allow the characters other than Jenny Lee to have stronger story lines, which I can accept to an extent. But some of the story lines have been expanded for dramatic effect, so they are not relying upon the original author's memoirs, but rather the imagination of the scriptwriters, which I think is somewhat regrettable.Having said that I am finding the series entirely watchable, and enjoyable. All the cast seem to be good, but I must say I am most impressed with Miranda Hart as Chummy, what a brick she is."
tt1983079,"Call the Midwife is an awesome series, and probably the best currently on television. The story lines are excellent and seems to be, for the most part, historically correct and accurate. This series is based on the best-selling memoirs, Call the Midwife, by Jennifer Worth, who died six months before the first episode aired. The series depicts, in part, and has been expanded upon, her work as a district nurse and midwife in the East End of London during the 1950's and 1960's. Obviously, story lines needed to be expanded to create a long-running series such as this, but that does not hinder the enjoyment of the program, and in fact, probably adds to it, as it allows for development of new and existing characters. Every single cast member is believable. The acting of everyone is phenomenal and realistic. The writers have done an exceptional job with the scripts. The sets seem to be relatively accurate for the time period. You couldn't ask for a better more realistic series. While some reviewers have complained that this strays away a little from the memoirs, I can't see that anyone could expect a long running series not do so. When Jennifer Worth was writing her memoirs, she was writing them as a memoir and not in preparation for a long running television probgram. For this to have worked for television, , more needed to be added, and the script writers have done it in an exceptional way."
tt1983079,"I've been a bbc fan since I first watched Monty Python in Dallas where it 1st aired in the early 70s.
Call the Midwife is so well done. The cinematography and the acting especially is superbly done. I forget I'm watching a show and am brought to tears every episode. I can't wait to watch it all again but with my wife this time."
tt1983079,"My wife and I have been regular viewers of PBS' various British dramas for more than 40 years. I believe that ""Call the Midwife"" stands with anything that PBS has shown in that time. The cast is outstanding, and is aided by terrific writing. The producers and writers have done a very good job of pulling stories from the books, and presenting an element of 20th Century London history that most American viewers knew nothing about. There is a wonderful blend of humor, sadness, and an overall sense of time and place that is rarely achieved in TV dramas. I have particularly liked the sensitive portrayal of the sisters throughout the series, since (believe it or not) my mother had studied to become a nun. They are consistently shown as a complete person, not characterized as stiff and robotic people. If you haven't read the books the series is based upon, try them. You will see how faithfully the producers have followed them. A wonderful series!"
tt1983079,"Somewhere along the way 'Call the Midwife' has become the nations favourite drama, often toppling Downton in the ratings and earning a reputation as the must watch programme over Christmas.The reason for its success on paper is simple. It features good actors, good story lines and is gentle viewing on a Sunday night. It's not afraid to tackle big issues, but there's always humour along the way.The show has had to change over time, losing its main leading lady in Jessica Raine after series three and then dealing with Miranda Hart's decision to scale back her appearances.The BBC's decision to commission multiple series ahead of time shows how much 'Call the Midwife' has touched the public's heart."
tt1983079,"Good acting, good directing, but good lord this show is schmaltzy with a capital S. I wish folks would realize there is a happy medium between serious and uplifting versus Highway to Heaven meets a hearty side helping of cheese."
tt2433738,"I absolutely loved Wentworth. I don't think I've ever been more surprised by how much I've liked a show quite like this one. Every episode of every season is good. It's addicting. I binged the entire series as quickly as I could and I would dare to bet you would to if you haven't seen it yet. It takes a look at the lives of the women inmates and the staff at Wentworth prison. This show is intense, violent, gritty, intelligent, all of those. It's a pretty if cast and there's not a weak link among them. They all do a fantastic job. I can not recommend this show enough. Give it a chance and I promise you won't be disappointed."
tt2433738,I cannot overstate just how good Wentworth really is! It will hook you from the first episode and keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. Like everyone else on here that has compare it to Orange is the New Black (which I liked) I have to agree that this is the far better show! It's a lot like Game of Thrones where no character is safe no matter who they are. Some of biggest characters on the show will die or leave but the quality stays the same season after season!
tt2433738,"When I read the summary for Wentworth I thought it was going to be an Orange is the New Black knock-off, but I was wrong. Australian prison drama Wentworth is a ruthlessly dark. It's tragic and gripping, it has a lot of characteristics of OZ. Wentworth's careful plotting is a great example of what can happen when a show actually tries. It's smart and well acted. I actually prefer this show to OITNB. It has more depth and character, it just more real and gritty, like OZ. After each episode I just wanted more and more. It nice to watch a show that isn't over advertised or filled with famous names to rely on viewer ship. Superb acting from all of the cast."
tt2433738,"I was a huge fan of the first season of Wentworth Prison when it was shown on Channel 5 in the UK last year. I thought the series proved to be a great 'standalone' drama with high quality production values, excellent writing and acting. The series at the same time also paid subtle and gracious homage to Prisoner, a special and ground breaking show. Well the second season doesn't disappoint, building on the quality of the first season, and it is mostly down to the clever introduction into the Wentworth mix of one character - Joan Ferguson. Pamela Rabe is simply brilliant as Joan Ferguson - taking on the mantle of one of the most iconic of TV characters and breathing a new 21st century life into her is no easy job, but Rabe achieves it, obviously relishing the opportunity to play such an unusual female character. Rabe's on screen presence, controlled physical stillness and a real glint in the eye hides an obvious wealth of feelings, which comes out in small doses throughout the season, in carefully played scenes where unexpected kindness and sincerity adds real depth to an already complicated individual. The 'new' Joan Ferguson has obvious OCD and abhors physical contact. Her compulsion to control every part of her environment (including her office) her staff and prisoners is wonderfully realised by Rabe, with a series of subtle physical ticks, cold stares and calculating mental games with everyone around her. Great use is made of prison security cameras which become Joan's 'All seeing eye'. Clever adaption of surgical gloves is used as a visual tease (and a wink) in the early episodes of what is to come from Joan later on. The writing, production and cast are universally excellent once again, with particular mention to Nicole da Silva and Danielle Cormack who play Frankie and Bea. As in the first season, the use of slow motion image capture and end sequence music is particularly effective. I for one can't wait for season three."
tt2433738,"I put off watching this for a long time, under the false impression that it would just be a different version of 'Orange Is The New Black' (which I do love, but am not really searching for shows similar to it because I don't particularly like jail/prison shows) but man was I wrong. It is NOTHING like OITNB. Their similarities begin and end with it being set in a female prison.When I finally gave in and started watching, I was instantly hooked. Each episode is filled with action and drama and plenty of moments that make you either laugh or cry. The characters are unique and truly wonderfully played, you will quickly grow to love or hate each of them (sometimes both!) and as you learn their backstories you get a sense of really knowing and understanding them. There are some scenes that will literally have you on the edge of your seat, with your heart racing, yelling at the TV. After finishing this, I had to go find 'Prisoner Cell Block H' and give it a try. While it's nowhere near as good as 'Wentworth' (in my opinion) it was definitely neat to see the differences between the two. I'd definitely recommend Wentworth to anyone, I can't think of anyone I know who wouldn't like it, all of my friends who have watched it agree that it is one of their all time favorites! You will be kicking yourself for waiting so long to watch it!"
tt2433738,Every season has been great and it just continues to get better. There are so many holes and unbelievable storylines and I couldn't care less. Sure it's more like a really strict high school than a prison but it's always entertaining. Characters come and go but there's always something new and juicy - highly recommended.
tt2433738,"I thought Orange was a great tv show. Very well done with good flow. But let's be honest. Wentworth brings you the truth nitty gritty of a women's prison. This is Orange on drugs and set on fire.This show is simply amazing! I wasn't so sure I was going to like this. But it's sucks you in and I binge this every single day. The waiting and chomping at the bits for the newest season to release.The acting, stories, characters, flow, scenes very much done with excellent execution! This show is a true prison show that just about our ranks all others.I've recommended this show more than I can remember. If you haven't watched then you need to. You will not be disappointed. (P.S: this is not for kids)"
tt2433738,"Just finished episode one of ""Wentworth"", the 2013 remake of the totally brilliant Prisoner Cell Block H, The characters names are the same, Erica, Vera Bennett, Bea Smith, Lizzie Birdsworth, Doreen Anderson, Mr Fletcher, even Frankie Doyle.The first episode leads us down the route like the first episode of the original with some surprising differences, and one huge change from the original, which you will have to watch Ep1 to see, it came as a shock and surprise to me, and I loved it, it made sense to do it this way.As long as the great writing and acting continue then Wentworth Prison will last for many many years, it would also be great to see some faces from the original pop up albeit as someone else, how about Val Lehman as governor, now that would be amazing.If you want a really gritty drama, that harks back to the 80's but is new, modern and right up to date, along with great acting and writing, then this is definitely for you, currently it is on Wednesdays Channel 5 10pm (UK), go on, you know you want to."
tt2433738,"IM an old prisoner fan. queen Bea and her mates were fantastic. I was a bit reluctant about the remake. But i have to say its been amazingly good, gritty and fully entertaining. Wentworth is on its way to being just as good as prisoner cell block h, don't be put of because its not the same as the old one , in a lot of ways it can be better. you'll love it. The prison looks good. No wobbly sets. Some of the characters are still here, well in fact most of them are, You will find some have just been switched around. Its set before the original one. It gives the viewer a better idea of how and why things came to be, that in its self is making the whole first season."
tt2433738,"A tense, thrilling and grasping TV series. Very much underrated. I love prison based shows so i was a huge fan of this. It got straight to the point and doesn't disappoint. I cannot wait till its back. I also watch Orange is the new black but this concept is different because its more serious. You cannot compare the two even though both is based around womens prison unit. You do not have to like a certain genre to watch this or be super intelligent, you can simply enjoy it. I'm really upset hardly anyone I know doesn't watch it which is why i had to write this review as to why everyone should! Again like any other show there are characters you love and hate which is awesome I get so attached to them. It is not a typical storyline in an everyday prison is what i loved."
tt2433738,"100% my most favourite TV series ever and I've seen a lot of TV series. It's gripping and gruesome with great storylines and acting. I will be disappointed the day that it ends as I look forward to this show airing each year, the most."
tt2433738,This show is surgically executed. It builds and builds and when you least expect erupts like a violent volcano. I warn you it can be bloody and violent but that's the shock of it because you don't see it coming. Just when you think it's become stable BOOM. THIS is the best prison show hands down. The casting and acting is out of this world. Each of the seasons finales are staggering. I've watched all 3 seasons and each is a prize waiting to behold. This series is brilliant. The way the lead has grown and transgressed is so awesome. I love this show. Orange is the new black I can't even watch after I first saw this. It literally changed the game. You don't understand how much of a favor you'd be doing your self by watching this incredible show. Bravo
tt2433738,I hate that the main characters with great character development had the most hardship then you have Doreen who cries for 5 straight seasons with a happy ending
tt2433738,"Looking back now, Prisoner was a laugh riot. Dad and I were laughing when they repeated the original series, again, that seems so cheesy now, if of course unrealistic, judging by the larger than life plots, and some highly and insanely unlikely scenarios, that caused a bit of eye rolling. Oh, how times have changed. This new, better series is more modernized as now having security cameras with much better looking women and better actors, although the ones from the original must be praised too. Don't fault them, it's what they had to work with. We retain our chief characters from the original, though some, altered, here and there, especially Vera 'Vinegar Tits' Bennett, played wonderfully by a familiar Seachange face. Danielle McCormack holds her own, very strong as Bea, and a much hotter looking Frankie Doyle, is a very animated and absorbing character, wonderfully played by De Silva, up there by McCormack. Even the brief Jim Fletcher character is reprised by McCleod's Daughter's Aaron Jeffrey. But it's Pamela Rabe as the notorious Joan Ferguson, who's really scarring and creepy to the max. I was impressed and admired her take on the role, that's so creepily haunting, I prefer her to Maggie's Kirkpatrick's portrayal. It's great to see different actors do the same role, putting their own spin on it. Hey if they copied the other actors, it would be boring, and unwatchable, but when actors breath a lot of originality, life and traits into that role, you know it will be, and I'm not just saying that about Rabe's, but her performance was the one, who had the real effect on me, that sly smile, and those unreadable expressions in that steel gaze of hers, that only leaves you wanting more. This is one of those successful remakes, a much scarier and tougher Prisoner this time around, some women you don't want to mess with, the much younger ones, some real cuties. Hey, if you want laughs and escapism, just go back to the original, as this one, a much more serious and intense series, is far different from what went on 24 years earlier. Excellento."
tt2433738,"Initial skepticism of trying to remake a classic serial drama like Prisoner was quickly dispelled in the first few minutes of episode 1. This is a completely new take on a long running series from the 1980s with the necessary level of added grit needed in 2013. Whilst employing many of the well known character names; the ""new"" version has created juicy variations to the originals. Those familiar with the original series should not allow themselves to by put off in the early stages by casting of different types to play the original characters. Ep 1 was edgy, well paced and the acting overall was very good. If Wentworth can maintain the same intensity over its remaining 9 episodes of season 1, it will be a treat to watch. As well as seeing how the initial variation to different main characters develop, perhaps growing into their more familiar traits from the original series as the new series progresses. Clearly this re-make is attempting to tell the background story as to how the likes of Bea Smith, Vera Bennett, Meg Jackson and Frankie Doyle came to be like they were in the original Prisoner series."
tt2433738,"I think this is the best TV series I have ever seen. Gets me chills everytime. Seasons don't lose their quality as it usually happens in other shows, this one only gets better and better. Wentworth, you are under arrest, you stole my heart!"
tt2433738,"This is a series definitely binge worthy. Better than ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK (in my humble opinion) and based on PRISONER, which ran on Network Ten (AU) from 1979 to 1986. I give this series an 8 (great) out of 10 and have become very attached to it's characters. {Drama and Intrigue in a Women's Prison}"
tt2433738,"S1 - ( 8.3/10 ) very slow at first yet builds up important character arcs and AMAZING ending.
S2 - ( 9.5/10 ) HERE WE GO! This is where the good stuff starts, mainly due to the rise of characters and one of the best villains of all time, enters the story.
S3 - ( 9.2/10 ) You are addicted now. You will want to watch one, after one, after one. Like every episode ends with a cliffhanger that pulls you deeper into Wentworth
S4 - ( 9.1/10 ) Very sad season. Love it!
S5 - ( 8.5/10 ) ehh, runs a bit dry yet still compelling. One of, if not, the BEST FINALE EVER.
S6 - ( 8.7/10 ) New characters are introduced so it's a bit hard to get by that, but soon they become iconic and part of the family. Story stretches a bit yet by this point Wentworth is in your heart and you can't help but continue watching. Super good !
S7 - ( 9.2/10 ) AMAZINGLY JAWDROPPING. Considering it was originally going to be the end, it was beautifully written and acting, visual is great. Story arc is scary! Yet very appealing. BEST FINALE EVER!!!!!! Seriously, you have to watch!!
Overall it's an amazing show that is a MUST WATCH (9.8/10)"
tt2433738,"The last thing I ever expected to appear in the TV listings was a new series based on the excellent Prisoner Cell Block H! Being a big fan of the original series I had to see what it was like.The acting is good and it has the same mix of tragedy and tension as the original. I think it's a good move that they didn't try to exactly copy the characters and stories of the original, instead opting for some familiar names and a whole new story with some reminders of Prisoner for the fans.You have to hand it to Australia, there are some genres of TV they do better than the rest of the world, namely soap opera and prison drama. Great stuff, I will definitely be tuning in next week. Well done to Channel 5 for buying in something worth seeing for a change."
tt2433738,"After reading the rave reviews I decided this must be something special. About half way in my wife and I looked at each other and laughed. The cheese factor, terrible acting and unbelievable setting and circumstances is beyond calculation. Thay so many people think this is good TV makes me question the fate of mankind."
tt1733785,"First of all. It's sad to say, but ""Smockan"" and ""seattle_kid"" seems to have COMPLETELY missed the fact that the female police-officer Saga Norén in the series, played by Swedish actress Sofia Helin, is a portrait of a person with Autistic spectrum of Asperger type. And they unfortunately confuse it with bad acting in their reviews. Well, well...To me that mistake never became a problem. Then again, I am myself a person with a Autistic spectrum of High-functioning type (HFA). A ""near cousin"" to Asperger. And I was simply stunned. Sofia Helins interpretation of a police-officer with Autistic spectrum of Asperger type was just excellent. Maybe not perfect, but excellent. And it is without a doubt one of the best performances I've ever seen, made by an non-autistic actress/actor. (Watch out, Dustin Hoffman *wink*)The chemistry between the actress/actor Sofia Helin and Kim Bodnia are excellent as well. I'm actually not going to say anything about the plot itself. It would be wasteful. Just be aware that the female police-officer in the series actually is a person with Autistic spectrum of Asperger type (for less confusion), see the show, and be amazed. I was.Me, I'm now impatiently waiting for ""Bron/Broen 2"", which is planned to be aired 2013."
tt1733785,"I haven't seen the Killing yet, but I will. I certainly will if it is as good as this Scandinavian crime drama. The story is very compelling, gripping and brilliantly executed. The acting is first rate, especially that of the two leads Kim Bodnia who plays Martin Rohde and the utterly brilliant Sofia Helin who plays the clever but quirky Saga Noren. I have to say she makes the show for me, alright she is blonde, beautiful and Swedish, but her performance is exceptional and you can't help but love her character. Saga works very well with Martin in trying to solve the crimes and the satellite characters and stories work equally as well. I also have to mention the direction, camera work and general production of this series as it is as good as anything I have seen. I shall be very sad when it finishes."
tt1733785,"@ Robert-Temple ""To say that it is impossible to feel even the slightest twinge of sympathy for Helin's character,"" As some one with Aspergers myself, I fully appreciate how far you are from being able to understand why you should be able to feel sympathy for Helin's character.Helin's portrayal is fantastic, and thanks to programme like this Aspergers and Autistic Spectrum disorders are finally sinking into the public's consciousness to the extent that, one day, we might be able to live in a world that can find more than the slightest twinge of sympathy for the way that we behave.I had no idea her character was an aspie - I had no idea about anything to do with the show before I watched it, but I picked up she was an aspie in the first scene she was in. She is great. And, despite what another reviewer has said, she is hot. Irrelevant, but fact."
tt1733785,"No special effects. No 'nice weather' filter/overlay. Not a new case every episode. Instead, a well written, well balanced story. Realistic, suspending and occasionally funny.The main characters are very well written and well played in my opinion. So much better than the Hollywood variants! Both the story and characters are believable and not overacted, like the many, many Hollywood variants.Also a very important aspect is the overall story line. Too many police/detective shows have a 1 or 2 case per episode methodology and hardly a background story. That gets old fast. Bron/Broen does this well: one (big) case (so far) with many other related things happening for following episodes.Have seen only 2.5 episodes so far, but had to mention this. Excellent!"
tt1733785,"I absolutely loved this series. The story is intriguing from the start: a corpse is found on the bridge between Denmark and Sweden, carefully positioned so that each half is in a different country. The story that evolves from there is satisfactorily complex, without getting silly, and full of suspense. There are a lot of interesting characters in the series, but the stars are the two investigators. Saga Noren, who clearly has a fairly serious Asperger syndrome, mixes an infuriating lack of understanding of people's feelings with an endearing innocence and admirable honesty. Martin Rohde, a more traditional investigator, is a man that often doesn't really think about the consequences of his actions,and is willing to break rules. The relationship between these two provides a lot of interest and plenty of really entertaining moments. Everything is greatabout this series - the story, the ending, the characters, the music,the photography (the night shots of the bridge and the city that are interspersed during the series are mesmerising). More like this please!"
tt1733785,"To sum up in short: suspense, good acting, real empathy for the story line, great appropriate music, twists that keep you hooked wanting to keep going. The two leads are very different, and equally interesting and complex. The support cast is first rate, and the suspense just keeps building.Best drama/ mystery that I've seen for ages. Well worth it. By epp2 I was pleasantly surprised that it kept the intrigue up. By Epp3 I was thinking of ringing in sick for work to keep watching. If you like your mysteries to keep surprising you, and adding layers, and layers, then this is for you. There aren't the usual ""holywood"" dumbed down explanations at the end of each epp, instead it makes you keep thinking.I have to say that they have done a first rate job with the music score too.Although even without it, the storyline gives you plenty of emotional reaction.This is one show to set aside free time for, with out distractions. And just enjoy."
tt1733785,"So far (episode 3) ""Bron"" provides all the classic criminal genre elements with a modern and smart touch. The characters and actors fit their roles well (albeit being caricatures of the genre). I especially enjoy the humorous and feminist take on Saga Norén's character. For me all these little stylistic touches just add to the enjoyment. And the plot elements fit an interconnected Scandinavian/European reality without seeming overdone or simplified. I'd say this is one of the most exciting crime dramas of the decade, even since its function is not intended to be a long-running series with one main protagonist. I like the ""issues"" approach of ""Bron"" more than the classic European detective drama we've seen so far in the 2000s."
tt1733785,"The Wire was gritty, politically interesting and great TV. Dexter had beautifully rounded characters; every one unique and interesting, quality acting and intriguing moral questions and there have been several other landmark quality TV productions. Bron or Broen absolutely takes the cake. I've never felt so fully immersed, so entertained and so gripped by film or TV. The complex and gradually emerging storyline, personal interactions, realistic action, the landscape scenes that demand freeze-frame for a second admiring look, the simply stunning acting that portrays the unusual but lovable Saga (many of who's comments trod a knife edge between humour and truth), beautiful music perfectly placed, characters you wished you knew. It just goes on... inspiring... genius.Written after episode #9 Now I've seen episode #10 I'll have to revise my ten stars to eleven. Don't miss this."
tt1733785,"Its Saturday 6:00 pm and the last 2 episodes are on tonight! Its a long time since I've been this hooked on a TV series. Acting, story, setting, filming are all marvellous. The two leading characters and their interplay make a new approach to the 'two opposites been thrown together as partners'. I hope it doesn't offend any sufferers but the Aspergers Disorder of one partner is in no way sad or treated lightly but is extremely funny at times. I was fortunate to record the earlier episodes before todays and have watched two on the last 4 consecutive nights (Im not deleting them and look forward further Bridge weeks in the future). Im only saying all this to encourage anyone who hasn't watch it to do so though you may have to wait for the DVDs. Its 6:15 now, 2:45 to go!"
tt1733785,"I have to admit that I'm astonished. Nevertheless I will try to make it short. This piece of TV is outstanding. Although it runs over 10 episodes I was never bored. The plot is well thought through, has some nice twists, and is very well told and filmed. More than anything Sofia Helin's performance made me wishing to see more and more. Outstanding job! And believe it or not: I'm really looking forward to the US-remake. I think this story could work very well between the U.S. and Mexico, and maybe even better as there can be added several new topics between such different countries in comparison to the pretty similar Sweden and Denmark. I just hope that Diane Kruger is capable of doing a similar good job as the lead. At the moment I tend to believe she can, as she might be capable of providing this particular combination of prettiness and coldness, just as Helin provided in such a brilliant way."
tt1733785,"I guess reviewer Smockan didn't notice that Sofia Helins odd character had Aspergers Disorder which results in a very asocial behaviour. She don't know how to socialize or communicate in a normal fashion. She knows nothing about being diplomatic or ""holding back"". She's just barging in like a bulldozer. I've seen the first 9 episodes and was amazed by the exciting storyline, the twists and Kim Bodnias acting. Sofia Helins performance isn't top notch but the character is so amusing and hilarious so you cant do nothing but love her. as long as you don't have to meet her in real life. =)Those of you out there who just watched one episode and thought ""this is crap. Cant stand watching this piece of *beeep*. Let's watch Wrestling instead"" just don't know what you missed. This is a great crime series and it shows that Sweden and Denmark should co op more often when it comes to made for TV-drama."
tt1733785,"The first seasons was decent, i'm a big fan of Kim Bodnia, wonderful actor.Saga is the female protagonist, an expert on everything, extremely socially competent or absolutely clueless socially (*if* it makes the situation funny).We're supposed to believe Martin complements Saga, but he's not good at anything really. He's not fast, he can't fight. The one thing he can do is tell Saga ""that's not socially acceptable, you need to do it like this.."" (if it makes the scene funny or awkward).If there's something good to say it's not exactly as political as most/all series in Sweden are, that can get very tiring and especially if you don't agree with rich and privileged people's political ideas.The premise here is quite interesting, but Saga is unfortunately not that great or believable as a character due to the poor and often rather childish writing. The villains are like straight out of a TV series aimed at kids / teens. I would have preferred less ""epic"" plots that seems to be inspired by american 80-90's action movies and instead have the darker more down to earth and gritty crime/thriller that Scandinavia usually does really well."
tt1733785,"This series is about the co-operation between a danish and a Swedish cop in solving a string of murders in the Copenhagen/Malmo area. I would advice readers not to listen to people who didn't even bother watching at least half the series before writing a review. Truth is, the show is a bit of a slow starter. At the end of episode one, I was left with the impression of a fairly mediocre show with an annoying female lead character that is poorly acted. However, one soon realizes that her restrained and unemotional manner is part of her character. Underneath this, Sofia Helin adds subtle nuances and complexity to her character that shows that she is a good actress. The plot also picks up and gets gradually more exciting and entertaining. Contrary to what others suggested, Kim Bodnia (who plays the danish cop) was actually very enthusiastic about this project and had nothing but praise for his female co-star. Needless to say, he is also very good in his role here.So my opinion is that this is a well made series with a complex and entertaining plot, interesting characters and good cinematography. On the negative side, some of the actors playing minor roles are sometimes less than stellar, the plot is far-fetched in places and the sound quality leaves some things to be desired in a few scenes. But with that said, Bron is a very good and well made series. Just make sure to give it a chance beyond the first couple of episodes or so before you decide what to think. Especially the main female character is somewhat unusual and requires some time to get a grasp of. But give it (and her) a chance and you won't regret it."
tt1733785,"The Scandi-dramas keep on coming on BBC4. This one is a corker. It's right up there with 'The Killing' - and that's saying a lot. OK, the story is not really credible, but it's a thriller, and that's what thrillers tend to be like. It fulfils the main criterion of a thriller: it's thrilling - and it kept me glued to the screen throughout (the subtitles actually help you to focus).The best thing about the serial is the characterisation and acting. Saga! What a character. What an original. How brilliantly played! As time went on she became more and more fascinating, and in the last two episodes... I can't explain without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it yet. Let me just say that it becomes very moving.What about her partner, Martin? At first he seems to be a jovial teddy bear of a family man, but he is gradually revealed as a much more complex person. The interplay between him and Saga is perfect.There are other good characters, too. The son, August, is excellently portrayed, and really comes up with the goods at the crucial time.Admittedly, there are weak points, such as two slightly pointless sub-plots/red herrings, and a killer whose doings are not terribly believable and whose role is not very convincingly acted. Some events are skated over and mysteriously ignored once they have happened. One suspect in particular is questioned in the most perfunctory way, to allow neatly for more mayhem.All that aside, it's fantastic. If you get the chance to see it, don't miss it."
tt1733785,"Bron/Broen simply confirmed Scandinavian dominance in crime drama at the beginning of the 21st century. In certain aspects it surpassed The Killing (Forbrydelsen) and is overall on par with Sherlock.For some reason all Scandinavian crime dramas and thrillers are bleak and grimy. This is in contract to one of the best living standards in the world and supposed happiness it should bring.There have been complaints about Sofia Helin's performance. She plays a person that is obviously afflicted with a syndrome or a condition. In that sense, she offers a finest performance, not a lesson in ""wooden acting"" as it had been implied. In an interview she stated how her inspiration has been a goat, on a level that she follows her instincts.Kim Bodnia is great and the rest of the crew is above average. Overall, this is a great show."
tt1733785,"It was a great pleasure to watch this series. I actually missed the first episode unfortunately, but watched from episode 2 to the last one. One of the reasons i enjoyed it was that the story actually at several points resembled one of my favourite campy b-horror movies from 1971, the British ""The abominable Dr Phibes"" starring Vincent Price. There were a lot of similarities so i could eventually guess what would happen in episode 9 and 10, but it didn't ruin the experience at all.Acting was great, i loved the characters that Sara Helin and Kim Bodnia are playing, and the complicated story of finding out who the serial killer is and what the motivation is really plays out well. Hope this gets distributed outside scandinavia."
tt1733785,"I wont go into much detail but I urge you to watch this fantastic show. It is intelligent, funny and moving. The main reason for my review is in defense of Helin, she was brilliant in this and in fact becomes the more entertaining of the duo. Bodnia's character is more traditional and although they work really well together it is Helin's performance that gives this show depth. It is a real shame that people didn't get this character, the autistic nature of this female detective echos the psychology report of the killer and leaves us amused, bemused but sure that being on the autistic spectrum is what makes her a fantastic police woman. I think her character can be summed up through her inability to lie, or withhold the harsh truth, in order to provide comfort in uncertain times! Having watched the show with subtitles the characters still shine through, very well acted. In my opinion give this a chance and you will enjoy!"
tt1733785,"The fictitious character Saga Noren , believe it or not , is a household name in many parts of Europe . The Bridge, an original Swedish-Danish production is a compelling series with no peg. It is original and challenging to any new watcher. Warning- you'll be hooked before you knew it. Saga Noren , the brilliant but socially awkward detective is the keyholder to the lock. Martin, the partner and the other half of the crime solving duo is like a good Catholic priest. The pair complements each other like salt and pepper, one won't work without the other. The plot is politically , sex & blood-laden yet highly complex for anyone to figure out who the killer from hell is. The reveal is only until the very , very end. Anybody who intends to watch this will definitely not forget this show and the name Saga Noren will be added to your vocabulary."
tt1733785,A grisly murder on the bridge spanning Sweden and Denmark brings together two odd couple detectives. The Swedish policewoman is brilliant and driven but blind to social niceties whilst the Danish cop is gruffly likable and old school in his policing methods. The murderer employs improbably convoluted means to apparently bring attention to social inequity.This is underscored by locations where the privileged are seen in their smart architect designed homes and the homeless surviving in plastic shelters on bleak waste grounds. The downbeat mood is appropriately filmed in a monotone low key palette and pauses between the action are filled with poetic long shots of the cities of Malmo and Copenhagen beneath lowering skies.After viewing episode three there is an unavoidable feeling that this series is set in the tradition of Scandinavian crime pioneered by the writing team of Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo and furthered in more recent times by the Wallander and Unit one television series. A more understated approach would have been preferable to the drama that at times suffers from hyperbole but I am looking forward to the coming episodes nonetheless.
tt2404499,Such a unique and interesting anime. Much content too. Great character development. Recommend to anyone who likes ancient war movies and anime in general.
tt2404499,"First few episodes feels shaky due to animation but you get used to it. Impressive story, great characters design, excellent plot and most important thing is you won't feel tired or clumsy or lazy during watching this anime."
tt2404499,One of best openings on anime kingdom is a masterpiece one of the best anime i saw and i know i never will see like kingdom what a beautiful journey I lived with kingdom
tt2404499,"Kingdom anime is just one of the media with which the story is presented. The manga is ongoing, 762 chapters and counting. The live action film is on its third installment but available only in Japanese theaters. It's a franchise that will not likely reach Kimetsu No Yaiba or Attack on Titan levels internationally with the stark absence of English translations, but for a huge fan like me, it is worth crossing the language barrier for.Chinese war drama in the hands of mangaka Yasuhisa Hara. This is what it is. Many of Hara's characters jump straight out of history, and they transform into larger-than-life generals, kings, vassals, and scholars, warriors, courtiers, in often flamboyant costumes and hairpieces. The two main leads, orphan warrior Shin and 31st King of Qin Ei Sei, carry the heart of the series (these two are the least flamboyantly dressed tough), and through their stories, together or apart, they share the goal of unifying the warring states and ending war for good.There is some criticism about the inconsistency and cartoonish aspects of the anime, but that can be overlooked as the story unfolds. Overall, Kingdom is epic storytelling, and I can see many more chapters, seasons, and movie sequels on the horizon."
tt2404499,Legendary anmei about chain history and history of genrals and the god King
tt2404499,Story holds together.... Not a single moment you want to miss. Perfectly executed.
tt2404499,"I would give it a 10star if it wasn't for the animation. It took me a few episodes to get used to it but now I hardly notice. The story, on the other hand, is amazing. It really surprises me the show isn't more popular. I recommend to anyone looking for a new show."
tt2404499,"It is really underrated, I know, the first season is awful because of the 3D/CGI animation, but the storytelling, characters, plot, wordbuilding and every else is simpli magnificent, watch the show, it worth the time. By the way, this show talk about the real history in China, the battles, the characters and the places existed 2000 years ago.Realmente está infravalorado, yo sé, la primera temporada es horrible gracias a la animación 3D/CGI, pero la narración, los personajes, la trama, la construcción de palabras y todo lo demás es simplemente magnífico, miren Kingdom, vale totalmente la pena. Por cierto, Kingom habla sobre la historia real de China, las batallas, los personajes y los lugares existieron hace 2000 años."
tt2404499,"I can't believe i stumbled upon this gem!! I wanted another high calibre anime after finishing one piece, and this delivered. Can't stop watching, it has an interesting plot and characters, great visuals, and fight scenes keep getting better. Highly recommend!!"
tt2404499,"At 38 episodes, this one takes a while to get going...and there is season 2 planned (don't know how many episodes this time), but if you can handle this many, then you must be into it and more will just be welcome...The story starts with 2 young orphans, Xin and Piao (pronounced 'Hou'), who live in China in the state of Qin during the warring states period and who fight each other every day with practice swords and dream of becoming great generals...one day a nobleman sees something in one of these orphans and decides to offer him a brighter future...the 2 orphans go their separate ways and adventures await them...I could go into a lot more depth here, as this is a long and detailed story, but I'll leave it at that...the animation is good, the characters are well developed and the action is balanced with an interesting story. As for how accurate it is, I'm not super knowledgeable about feudal Chinese history, so I can't say either way, but it makes for fun to watch! Just be prepared to sacrifice a lot of time on this one..."
tt2404499,One of the best anime that I watched. I wish there is announcement for season 3 anytime soon. It's been 5 years since season 2
tt2404499,"This anime will make you energetic, the actions are always so amazing and the story is pretty rich. The war scene really genuinely make you feel like this is how a Japanese war is like."
tt2404499,"I would definitely recommend this show to everyone interested in China's Warring States period, as well as anyone who loves history (which would be me). Both manga and the show are very good, the manga author has done a great deal of research in history, and that historic research and detail is shown in anime as well.With all it's historic seriousness, the main hero's clumsiness was like a comical relief to me and I kept laughing at his antics.Just like the other reviewers mentioned, the animation itself needs a lot of improvement in the beginning: some reviewers mention mistakes in season 1 only, I noticed some very glaring animation errors in season 2. But I am willing to forgive the poor early animation, since the storyline and voice acting are excellent.One reviewer was complaining about bad English dubbing.I watch anime in sub only and the VA's are excellent, my favorites are Masakazu Morita and Hosoya Yoshimasa in this show.Please give this show a try: you won't be disappointed. While you are at it, read the manga as well!"
tt2404499,This is one of the greatest anime in the world season 1 and 2 had a little animation problems but still managed to blow my mind and season 3 animation was good which is also one of the best season in the history of anime right now.
tt2404499,"The best continuous anime that you can see in your life, the first season you have to get used to CGI, and the second season will improve the drawing and become better, especially with the fourth season, the drawing in it is similar to the drawing of Wit Studio, frankly, the anime is oppressed and needs more attention than that, and readers of the manga say that the fifth season will be the strongest season and frankly I I am excited about him, especially with the new and bloody drawing that is coming from the studio itself. Awesome work and great music. I hope the work continues and doesn't stop."
tt2404499,"Stumbled across this one, and I'm kinda glad I did, the first 3 episodes the animation was kinda wonky 🤔 like a low-budget CGI or something, but after that it cleans up really well because they ditched the cheap CGIThe story, although fictional itself, is based off an actual time period and a way of life, and some characters are based off real peopleGive it a shot you'll probably like it, I tend to throw it on when I'm eating a quick meal, or just about a hour before I turn in for the nightAt least watch the first 10 episodes to get a feel for it, upon writing this review that's where I am."
tt2404499,"The cgi is absolutely horrid like clunky Playstation 1 bad and for the love of God don't try to watch the English version it's all monotone pause mid sentence and it just sounds like people reading out loud without any real emotion absolute worst voice acting ever.As for people claiming it's one of the greatest animes of all time..not a chance there's a extremely strong dislike for this show.But
The show is likeable but I could miss parts and not care at all it's not like I'm glued to the screen waiting to see what happens next it's just alright like something I might watch if I'm bored and have nothing else to watch or something to put on when I'm ready to fall asleep but want something on in the background."
tt2404499,"The Kingdom anime is the best war anime I have ever seen. Its story tells of a young man named Shin and Hyo, two brothers who aspire to become generals.The story is fabulous and wonderful in all respects, from the amazing strategies carried out by the generals, as well as the internal conflicts that exist in the Kingdom of Qin, and the change in events and others.What I didn't like about Kingdom is the drawing of the first season, but regardless of the drawing of the first season, the anime is great.I recommend that you watch it, as it is fun and even the manga is better than the anime itself."
tt2404499,"Love this anime 1st, 2nd series a bit slow but every other series has been unreal see series 3 and onwards been klass constant battles and alot of action it's in my top 3 animes love it and the hype. If you like samurai movies you shud like this anime I watch a load of anime like one punch man, chainsaw man, jujitsu kaisen, demon slayer, dragonball z you name it I've probably watched it especially if like a good popular anime and this is definitely up there as a great anime for me I love it. There is also an anime I recommend you watch but it's only a few episodes it's called drifters it also about a samurai give that a watch too if u enjoy this."
tt1882928,"Based on a comic by Yarou Abe, Shinya Shokudo is a story about a small hole in the wall late night restaurant (literally Shinya Shokudo in Japanese) that operates between midnight and 7:00 a.m. in the morning. The restaurant is run by only one person, the master (Kaoru Kobayashi) of the joint. There are only four items on the menu Tonjiru (pork based stew), beer, sake, and shochu (potato liquor), but customers can order anything the master can make in his kitchen. The restaurant is located in the Hanazono area of Shinjuku, and has only the generic description of ""Meshiya"" (food place in Japanese) on its lantern.So far 20 episodes has been on air between 2009 (the first series) and 2011 (the second series). They were all broadcast in the late night slot between midnight and 2:00 in the morning. For a late night program that are considered a ""hit"" if they average 1% viewers, this program consistently got over 2% ratings that attests to its popularity.The episodes consists of life stories of customers who frequent the restaurant, but starting in the second series, each episodes consists of new customer who have their own life stories going. Because of the hours the restaurant operates, and the nature of its size, customers who frequents the place have their life in specialized areas of society that includes gangs, construction workers, lady godiva, and also part timer, fast food joint owner, salaried workers, but most of them has special background that makes the story unique and interesting.Each episodes has particular dish that master makes that relates to the story. The list of foods on each of the episodes are as follows:Season 1:1. Baked Sausage and tamago yaki.2. Bonito shavings and rice3. Rice with tea4. Potato salad.5. Butter rice6. Katsu Donburi7. Egg sandwich8. Yaki soba9. Broiled Aji10. RamenSeason 2:1. Baked Sausage2. Chicken Karaage3. Steamed clam4. Nikogori (gelatin left from cooking fish)5. Canned foods6. Cream Stew7. Pickeled Bock Choi8. Cold ramen9. Potato cooked with beef10. Gyoza (Pot Stickers)The series is superb in that it tells the story of the underbellies of the society with emotion, sentiment and love unlike any other stories told. Food designer Nami Iijima designed the foods that appear in this series, and all of these items are common items consumed by Japanese families, but not usually served in ordinary Japanese restaurants.If you can find a copy of this drama, it will be an interesting watch guaranteed."
tt1882928,"Beware, there are two shows on Netflix with a similar name. They are basically the same, but presented separately. Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories, has two seasons from 2016 and 2019, and was commissioned by Netflix, but the original three Midnight Diner seasons ran from 2009 to 2014. I didn't know the difference at first, and couldn't understand why Netflix couldn't remember which episode I last watched, and why the characters use old cellphones in one episode and then a more advanced one in the next! Anyway, regardless of which series you watch, these slow-moving episodes are delightful as you get familiar with the culture, food, eating habits and regular customers of the restaurant dubbed the Midnight Diner, which, as the title suggests, opens at midnight. The owner, known as ""Master"", is willing to prepare any dish, as long as he has the ingredients. There is a short cooking summary at the end, so stay tuned until the credits. There are recurrent characters in both shows, but each episode can also be a stand-alone. The episodes are short and low-key, so you can watch it to unwind after a hectic day."
tt1882928,"I just have no language to communication the story - at all. It is drab, dry and surface deep. Well that would be it from one point of view.For me though, i just want to say, i was broken hearted when i found out there was no more seasons - more than an other show ever!I can't for the life of me say why.Why would i say that, well i felt this series drum up all the naive childish experience and the craving i once had to learn how to be a human .... and crystallized it in a single series.I can't say it is a moral endeavour but for me it was and well, better than anything else a came across in the past 20+ years. In the scope it was also revealing and heart warming. I will watch this series again more than any other over the rest of my life.I can't speak to the potential audience in this review because there is just so many points of view, what i can do though is speak to the creators:SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO thank you from the bottom of my heart, this is beyond magic and had enriched my soul beyond measure. i use this series as healing..... I use it and i want you all to know that it would not be magical if the people involved were not contributors to the magic. This is one of a kind! SO SO SO SO SO SO thank you very much!!!"
tt1882928,"I was hooked half-way through the first episode. I saw the word ""kind"" in another review here and, while it's not a word one usually associates with a TV series, kindness is one of the over-arching themes of the series. Kaoru Kobayashi, the main character (everyone calls him Master) has the kind of kindness that comes from inner strength, compassion, and wisdom.
The revolving ensemble of characters is wonderful. Great casting!
Sometimes the show seems to be a comedy, other times a drama, or a melancholy tale of unrequited.
Food, the sharing of, and the making of, is a important part of the show, as well. He cooks simple food, but every dish looks delicious!
I see the series was rebooted in 2019. I hope it, too, shows up on Netflix."
tt1882928,"Ultimately, this is about important moments in our lives and the foods we often associate with them.The stories are set at the Midnight Diner, a small and comfortable hole-in- the-wall sitdown you wish you could call your own.Open from midnight until seven in the morning, it attracts an array of regular and casual denizens. The proprietor will make whatever is ordered, so long as he's got the ingredients.Often what's ordered are comfort foods that remind the patron of the home of their youth, of a parent or someone close, or of a memorable or important life event. Sometimes it's all of the above.Many of the tales are peculiar, and even if you suspect a direction the story will take, it likely won't.Everything about the show is simple and unassuming, which of course is akin to most of our comfort foods.This won't resemble anything you've ever seen. We laughed out loud throughout and shed several tears. Every last second of it is beautiful, thoughtful, and unexpected."
tt1882928,50 years. Best gentle teaching of things Japanese EVER!
tt1882928,"Known in Japan as ""Shinya Shokudo"", this series is better known as ""Midnight Diner"" in the US.The series itself is about the main character ""The Master"" who is a chef at a diner named Midnight Diner, which is only open from midnight till 7am. The supporting cast is filled with people from all walks of life, such as: hotel workers, cab drivers, exotic dancers, etc as they all order something to eat and drink, sit down and enjoy each other's company, as well as the stories that each customer has to tell.The opening song to the series is a simple yet elegant Japanese folk song by the artist Tunekichi Suzuki. As you listen to the music it make you feel at ease and make you wonder what is he singing about.The song titled ""Omoide"" is translated to ""Memories,"" and by the way, the lyrics go by, he must be talking about memories of his own or memories of our own as we look into the sky. This fits well with Midnight Diner as in there is always a story to be told in a place you least expected and wonder what is that story is about. If you have the time.It is on Netflix and is worth the watch."
tt1882928,"An outline of this unusual show (people eat and meet in an all-night diner in Tokyo) both fails to describe its wonderful, sensual appeal and, at the same time, is as close to perfect as descriptions come. Because this is that rare thing, an unpretentious, beautifully made and acted series of cameo pieces, brought together by the accident of place and time. Part cookery show (with mouthwatering traditional dishes) part mystery series (who is anyone really, especially the mysterious owner and chef?), Midnight Diner plays with the puzzle of how we encounter strangers in our daily (or nightly) lives, and the sometimes significant effects even small encounters can have on us. Whether or not you have a prior interest in Japan and Japanese culture, this is captivating TV - a flavour of how simple storytelling is always the kind that makes the deepest impression and stays with you longest."
tt1882928,"The show brings about a serene calm when you watch it. The delicate theme mixed with the intricately flavoured characters, makes it a bowl you just can't keep down."
tt1882928,"I can certainly recommend this Japanese series. It brings to life a group of characters and their multi-dimensional life stories. They all are customers of a late night diner, and each story is told to completion, and matched to a favorite dish. It is a very slow but interesting way to tell a story."
tt1882928,"While not every episode hit the spot, most were small delights. A series of vignettes to savour."
tt1882928,"Midnight Diner 2009-2014. It's a bit of a slow burn to start, but some of the stories become inexplicably emotional. Loving the little cooking lessons after the story too. Feels really intimate, like they are inviting the viewers to be at home in the diner with the regular customers. If you enjoy watching shows set in Japan and don't mind subtitles instead of English, I highly recommend."
tt1882928,Midnight Diner is a simple TV series set mostly at a small restaurant in Tokyo that opens from midnight to 7am daily. Every episode has a different person or collection of people and dives into their lives. It is at once moving and intriguing. You just want to know more. Sometimes you root for these characters and sometimes you laugh at them and at other times you might shed a tear. Each episode also starts with a simple dish like a regular patron who just loves potato salad. You come to find out why he loves it so much and must always have seconds. And the episode will finish by sharing with you what makes good potato salad too. Its almost quirky but it is oh so endearing. Just 22 minutes each time but its bursting at the seams with such personal story telling.
tt1882928,"I don't know what brought me to watch this show, but I found myself completely fascinated. The storytelling is phenomenal, and what more can we expect of a show other than a story which makes us feel something. I've watched this show over and over again (each time with some heartwarming meal, mind you), and each time I find it more comforting than the last. Nothing conveys the beauty of flaws, the coincidence of living, and the serendipity of existence better than this show in my opinion. Give it a chance, grab a friend, and a bowl of your favorite heartwarming brothy meal, you won't regret it. :)"
tt1882928,What a great tv show this is. After browsing for hours looking for something new and original I came across this and I cannot happier. Can't think of anything else to say but just watch it.
tt1882928,"Midnight Diner is one of the most funny and touching drama. Every dish of food they introduced has got a memory and meaning connected to the character of each story. Every episode is a delight. Do you like ""butter rice"" with a touch of soy sauce?"
tt1882928,"If you like watching the skies, and the sun and the rivers and if you like forests more than skyscrapers, this show is for you. Prepare to F E E L so much. Creators of this show, thank you so much! <3."
tt1882928,"I've been trying not to binge this show because to me it is best consumed an episode or two at a time. I normally enjoy watching shows together with my wife but since she doesn't particularly have a taste for it, I find it most enjoyable watching alone at night when everyone is in bed. Although the stories are not particularly groundbreaking, each episode introduces new characters whose stories are reverently, and gently told. The subtle and thoughtful pacing has no equal among western shows and is perhaps due to the culture and setting as much as the story writing.I'm nearly through the third season and looking forward to slowly moving through the last two. I don't believe there has been, or will be anything quite like it."
tt1882928,"As an english speaking person who loves all Asian cultures especially manners, food & dedication, this is & has been the most uplifting series to watch. The simple yet tasty foods were a bonus. It showed good & bad, happy & sad but kept the storyline's real. Sometimes things don't work out. Sometimes life is hard.Thank you for a wonderful programme. 👍🏼"
tt1882928,The essence of this show is the human condition and the need for some to meet with others and share their world. A wonderful insight into modern Japanese culture and appreciation of the cuisine. The Master indulges his customers to express their daily lives within the intimacy of his diner. A welcoming home from home. Each episode explores aspects of every day life struggles delivered with emotional harmony. An uplifting experience to watch this delightful show.The show focuses on primary characters from different walks of life but they all have a common desire to return the Midnight Diner to enjoy the calm or company of fellow diners as their culinary desires are served and shared.Not to be missed.
tt1882928,Midnight Diner has a different regular cast member or guest dealing with a life situation every episode. It has occasional mild violence but relies on interesting plot lines and good writing to hook the viewer rather than loud explosions and special effects. The owner/cook of the diner has some undefined charisma/authority that his customers respect. The episodes are sometimes serious and sometimes amusing. Very much worth watching IMO.
tt1882928,"I must say, as rough as 2019- now has been.....I found great comfort in this little gem. At night it brought me such comfort. I had moved out oldest daughter and was now in the process of helping second daughter move out and fix up her new place.... THIS got my mind away from all that wk. And the fact that their father and I are now empty nesters(as they say)..I absolutely LOVE Master. And the people are just what I needed.... Loved every character!!! Every night while everyone slept, I found myself cutting this on, without even a thought! Thank you so much! Loved every minute! I so hope Master sees these!!! Well done.... You became part of my family. And I will treasure all of you always!North Carolina, USA. Nov.2022."
tt1882928,"MIDNIGHT DINER (2009-2014) was an excellent Japanese series about a small diner open from midnight to seven a.m. In the morning (12am-7am). The diner is visited by all sorts of interesting, bizarre and sometimes even shady characters, all with their own backstories, reasons for visiting the diner, along with special memories associated with their choice of dish. Some are Yakuza, some gay night club workers, some are struggling enka singers, but all have stories to share.Along with the many character's stories that are gradually revealed as the show progresses, this series also features cooking and many different Japanese recipes, making this a unique experience for food enthusiasts, as well as culture aficionados alike.This is a very mellow and simplistic series, but one that has a very quiet heartfelt and thoughtful atmosphere to it. I really enjoyed this and can thoroughly recommend. I must say however, that this show is for adults only as there is some light nudity present and the content can sometimes be risque and heavy. Overall, this series is a gem and I will be looking forward to watching the sequel series as well."
tt3069894,"This is about a orthodox Jewish family. I am not Jewish and I don't know much about it, so it's interesting to see certain customs.While it's a very different life from mine, it's so relatable! Family dynamics are just the same everywhere. They are real people that with all the feelings of pride, hurt and sibling rivalry. And there is such great humour in this show as well. I sometimes rewind scenes just to look at facial expressions of all involved, because the actors are great. All of them. The patriarch and youngest son are also played so well. Highly recommend, though it's clearly for a niche audience."
tt3069894,"Shtisel is a par above the best television and most cinema produced in Israel. My copious consumption of TV and film notwithstanding, I have never reviewed, but was compelled to when discovering the stunning absence of commentary for this stunning work of art.In a hyper digitized culture this show is reactionary to say the least. It returns to the origin of the medium of moving pictures, storytelling. Beautiful, delicate, morally challenging and consistently human stories. Technically the show is artful and precise, with a seemingly authentic, almost anthropological portrayal of a society that is generally inaccessible. Drama seems to arise slowly, patiently, through competent composition of scenes, performances that posses each character flawlessly, and again, stories that speak to the heart of who we are and how we relate to each other. Perhaps it takes a society that has not been swept by time as much as most, to demonstrate a few timeless truths that we can all relate to. We live in the golden age of quality television, no doubt. But I can count on one hand the number of shows that humbly rely on the basics: acting and story. No FX, no cynicism, no melodrama. If you enjoy Detectorists, this'll probably be up your alley."
tt3069894,"There is no 'blowing up and cussing' as the cliche goes. Nothing, absolutely nothing spectacular until you watch it. These seem to be real people in real life situations that relate to life as it is lived. Beautifully presented videography, superbly written scenarios and acting- the acting!"
tt3069894,"I cannot describe how much I enjoyed watching this series. The pace is perfect, the quality and strength of characters is second to none. I have totally fallen love with all of them particularly Shtisel and his Father. Shtisel senior is a fantastic actor, his energy is magical and his mannerisms are amazing. I have learnt so much about the Orthodox Jewish community, it has been so enjoyable and interesting. PLEASE bring out series 3. I not am not sure why this series has appealed to me and touched my heart so much but it has. I am a huge fan of World Cinema and this is a unique and original peice of work."
tt3069894,"Without exception, everyone I know who has been introduced to this series is hooked almost immediately. It is beautifully written and acted and gives us a rare look at an Orthodox Israeli family that nevertheless must deal with universal problems, contradictions and consequences. The English subtitles do not distract from the show's dramatic impact or the actors' nuanced performances. Orthodox Jewish viewers will undoubtedly have a better understanding of the material; there are subtleties that can be appreciated only by those familiar with the lifestyle. But that should not preclude others from giving this show the opportunity it deserves. There appear to be conflicting reports concerning the production of Season 3. Hopefully we have not seen the last of this terrific series."
tt3069894,"I started watching this by accident, and was hooked. It is so sweetly different and well worth a binge session. The characters were well written and not like the two dimensional ones in some dramas. I don't know anything about the Haredi community but this web of very human stories made me laugh out loud, brought me close to tears and left me wanting more."
tt3069894,Watched both series in a matter of days. This is the second Orthodox Jew series in a row for me. I'm thinking about buying one of those cool hats to wear.What absolutely floored me was how each and every episode captured my immediate and full attention from beginning to end. Whoever wrote the script must be a genius. The acting was wonderful but the script was miles above anything I've seen in a long time. I would easily watch a third and fourth series and never once tire of them.This series is Netflix at its finest. American network tv has a long way to go to catch up with this.
tt3069894,"Well at last I have found a program that I absolutely love. Grandma makes me laugh out loud, she is a real character. I am learning about this different culture and find it so interesting. So here it is 2019 and I have only just found it!! I think the actors are all superb! I wish it was more than just two series. Well done to all concerned. A really great and intelligent story."
tt3069894,"This show is just so special, beautifully drawn, written & presented, I loved all the characters, the opening credits, the unpretentious un self conscious feel of it and how the many aspects of personality/ behaviour around grief loss deception yearning etc is portrayed. Highly recommended. It's a shame so many people will be binging on exploitative muck like YOU and missing this wonderful heart and soul contribution. Thanks to all involved."
tt3069894,I am totally hooked on this and am sad that there is no 3rd series. It's amazing and the actors are fantastic. I especially love the girl Ruhami she's a brilliant actress. Please bring it back.
tt3069894,"This came up on the Netflix portal and I avoided it, as being probably all about religion and patriarchy and just ... heavy. Something in the face of the actors Doval'e Glickman - then something in the face of Michael Aloni - (Shtisel father and son, and we never really know who we love more and who is our main character) - jumped out from the publicity images. I'm not Jewish and have always been a bit scared of orthodox anything. The story is really elemental and could take place at any time. It takes its time to explore the impact of seismic struggles between parents and children and husbands and wives, the kinds of struggles - that can forge your character or wreck your life - that many of us are doomed to go through. But these people more so because God can called on by both sides to bolster their arguments. And there is much love in it, even when the characters are treating each other brutally. There is also playfulness and urbanity and some magic. It takes place in Israel but because the ultraorthodox don't approve of the society they live in ('those evil people' they call the Zionists), you can set aside your personal views about the political situation. The cast is incredibly well chosen for their roles, all very distinctive and lovable, even the bad characters; the acting is very fine; the pace is perfectly judged and the writing never intrudes; the locations are authentic-seeming; and the whole structure has the weight and momentum of myth, more truth than a true story and more treasurable and satisfying than anything else I can think of in any artform over the past decade or so. Thank you to all who collaborated and created this series - if you never did anything again in your life, you can be content you have reached a level of beauty that may not have previously been achieved in television."
tt3069894,I do not need to add to the reviews already posted. I do however have to say that Avi Belleli's soundtrack is a absolutely marvelous piece of work. Check it out folks....
tt3069894,... What happened to the dog?! A fun story if you don't look to close because there are a lot of holes throughout.
tt3069894,"I understand the rave reviews others have posted, I assume that if I was required (I wouldn't volunteer) to write a review for a series about the Amish this would have happened to me since I don't know enough about them (except how they dress). there's one things that binds them all they are not orthodox. I am. There's one thing they got perfect and for that I gotta give credit: The costumes. they are so spot on that they would pass even a close inspection and fool anyone in the street. as for the rest, well: The actors are decent (by Israeli standards not Hollywood's) their interactions would have been real anywhere outside of where they purport to portray. and here is the big problem: NONE; NOT EVEN A SINGLE ONE of the story lines and story arcs would actually cut it in the real world in the real religious community this couldn't possibly happen, none of it. they basically took a story from the secular world and inserted Ultra orthodox characters I was severely disappointed I expected them to have done better research being in Israel and in close proximity to the actual community.so for all the people hoping to get a glimpse or an insight into the lives of a religious family you are sadly misled, just because they are dressed so does not make it so and the costume definitely does not make the clown in this case.I only gave five stars because of the costumes, they're just phenomenal."
tt3069894,I've just watched series 1 and 2. Shtisel is outstanding. I've rarely watched anything so gripping and moving. This is as good as TV gets.
tt3069894,"Totally addictive, great character developments. Intense dramas with an omnipresent fine touch. Welcome to an approach to the life of an ultraorthodox Jewish family of Jerusalem."
tt3069894,"This is the first time I am watching a Israeli TV show on Netflix.
Wonderful ! after a long time you get hooked to a TV serial like this.As if you never wanted it to end.
But all good things come to a end.
Nukhem & Ruchami stood out as my - the two most endearing performances.-
Esp Nukhem he was a such a natural.
The vast exposure to the culture, food,religion ,relationships transports you into their world.All others too, played their part so well that you cannot forget them.This serial has made me realise that countries are different but the people in them are the same.Those conflicts, those doubts & most of all struggles in relationships.
The act of forgiveness in the serial says a lot.Shtisel has made me feel that I must visit Israel.Just have to go there!
Brilliant story telling."
tt3069894,"It is unbelievably good how the director could put life and emotion together to show the haredi's life.Passion, love, intrigues and some thrilling emotion make this TV Show iconic.Don't miss it."
tt3069894,"This is like, and as good as, Sopranos.Minus the cursing and profanities.Minus the killing and violence.Minus the drugs, save some low quality cigarettes and funny-looking yellowish wine.Obviously no sex or nudity.I don't know what it is with this series. All of the characters annoy me to some degree. It's so slow my mother stopped watching after 20 minutes because it's that slow.And yet.When the third series was launched, during corona, I was so happy. It's like meeting old family again. I know I won't be frightened or sick from the imagery. It's just totally zen. Akiva, this confused and complicated artist, making life hard for everyone - and us viewers in particular.I hope they never stop making this series."
tt3069894,Funny and sad. Real. Excellent acting and directing.
tt3069894,"Knowing absolutely nothing about orthodox Jews I had no expectations about this series, which I started watching after the mini-series Unorthodox.I only had the vague idea that a community of people who spend their lives studying holy books should have higher moral standards than the rest of us. Turns out, it was definitely not the case.If on one hand I was disappointed to see that the alleged ""saint men"" are as prone to misbehaving as anybody else, it was also refreshing to see how intensely human their stories are and how easy it is to relate to most of them (not quite all).We witness the pain of unrequited love; the fear of starting a new relationship after a certain age (and two deceased husbands); the burden of keeping a family after having married way too young; the grief for the loss of a devoted spouse but also the petty intrigues and the endless meddling into each other's affairs.The characters are complex human beings, with defects and all: Akiva is a idealistic young man who doesn't quite fit in; Shulem the meddlesome father who would like to let the past behind but cannot quite move forward; Giti is the imprisoned wife and mother who must deny at all costs all her frustration and unhappiness; Lipe is also not quite fitting in but with no more wiggle room, etc...Most interesting and very recommended."
tt3069894,"Being a Gentile, I found this a wonderful insight into the lives of the Ultra Orthodox Jewish religion. I agree with everything said in other reviews, and clearly some of the customs and practices were obvious. Eating, is very big if this drama is to be believed, and yes some of the older rabbis are not well versed in table manners. I also had to look up how this community survive financially with the men spending most of their time in study. Even when getting married with no visible means of an income, this doesn't seem to be a problem. It was nevertheless a compelling watch."
tt3069894,"Shtisel is an Israeli soap opera incongruously set among the Haredim (strictly religious ultra-Orthodox Jews).I've sat next to enough Haredim on long El Al flights and observed their insular and cloistered lifestyle over the decades to know that, unlike Kiva and his family, they don't act out of lust; they don't watch The Bold and the Beautiful on TV (or watch any TV, for that matter); they consider portrait painting idolatry, not art; and they don't hang out together in cafes shooting the breeze.The secular Israelis who wrote and produced Shtisel do all of these things, of course, but they are as distant from the Haredim as Earth is to Tatooine. The behavior of the Haredim in Shtisel is as foreign and as absurd as them staging a production of Shakespeare in Elizabethan English. Simply put, the Haredim don't act this way."
tt2049116,"A good friend of mine said to me, 'it was the best thing he'd ever seen, and it would change my life'. I'd never even heard of it, so that was a big statement. Turns out, he wasn't lying. Me and the wife watched all 4 seasons and then the movie in less than 4 weeks and now that it is finished, I am gutted. It's left a big hole in our TV life.
It has completely ruined TV for me because nothing else comes close to how good it is. We put 'Gangs of London' on straight after it, hoping it would fill a hole. We barely got to the end of Episode One, it was pathetic. Good if you're a 12-year-old boy who thinks one man can kill 15 hardened Albanian criminals in a pub like a cockney Chuck Norris!
Gamorrah has none of that rubbish and is really realistic. No fighting or over the top car chases- just a bullet in the chest. The acting is beyond brilliant, the grim backdrop is dramatic, and the characters are encapsulating. I've been told by an Italian mate of mine that the area it is set in falls into the top ten of most dangerous places in the world. The programme does it justice.
It is brilliantly and cleverly written; teasing you to like a character and then snatching them away from you. No one can be trusted, not even family.
I've been pining for it so much since it ended that I've even been watching youtube interviews in Italian!
The subtitles can sometimes be difficult to follow because the dialogue moves so fast, but it is never overly important. It is way beyond anything I have ever seen. Pure brilliance. Anyone who would give this less than 10/10 would probably enjoy Gangs of London or Ninja Turtles."
tt2049116,"Do not let the subtitles put you off this incredible show. This show is easily the best tv series i have ever watched. I blitzed 4 seasons recently and then watched them all again. Im now left with a tv void and has pretty much ruined any other show. I found myself obsessed, scrolling through user reviews and google maps of Naples. The acting is impecible and the scenes are realistic and brutal. Do yourself a huge favour and watch if you haven't already."
tt2049116,A very well-made TV series about the Camorra mafia in Naples. The director is not holding back on the dirty and gruesome details that classifies this organization. I must say that i'm very impressed with the crew shooting the series at the actual drug-ghetto as their location of choice. It gives a more authentic feel to the viewer. If you haven't seen the movie Gomorrah from 2008 i must recommend that you see it first. But i do feel that the 2014 series is of much better standards. Thumbs up! Alexx
tt2049116,"My review is not going to add a lot to most that are already written here. But I just had to write this. I'm 52, and I've seen a lot of movies, series and theatre/plays in my life. Hundreds. Thousands maybe.With that in mind, I am convinced that S3E12 is the best piece of acting, cinematography and screenwriting that I have ever seen. By far. I'm aware this is a matter of taste, not a fact, but I just have to share this, hoping to convince readers to go with Gomorra's flow and let it blow you away. For days or even weeks after watching it.I won't share the (essential) spoiler in the season 3 finale. In the episode's final 15 minutes, the dark side of mankind, deep compassion, unbelievable cinematography, death, deep hate and love come together... I can't find the words. It's even erotic in a disturbing way. Have watched it a dozen times now and I just have to watch it again and again. Can't get it out of my head.Have seen all four seasons (and the fourth season is a bit weaker than the previous three, therefore 9 out of 10) and all 48 episodes are outstanding (seriously), with the 36th as the series' magnificent highlight. Can't wait for the fifth season. I wish I could thank the creators and actors in person. Unbelievable.Finally: the moment at the end of each episode, when 'that track' starts again, and you know it's going to happen. What's going to happen? Start watching and you'll know what I mean"
tt2049116,"This series developed from the masterfully gloomy movie of the same title puts Italian production up close and center. This is very well crafted, with a impressive camera precision even though it's within the Gritty-style of modern cinema. Here and there you'll see some very inventive camera directing (a motorcycle-crash comes close to the best vehicle-scene I have seen since the first ""Mad Max""). It is a rough and gray view of mob-crime in a dystopia Italy, but even though the setting is the same ghetto as the movie ""Gomorra"" the social-realism of the movie is toned down by the producers, in order for a more character-driven narrative to emerge - that is good. This is a brilliant authentic-Italian and promising series, that recalls Sergio Leones ""Once upon a time in America"" just without wide angel and widescreen. And again it contains some of the technically best non-computer generated action-sequences I have seen since Michael Mann. BRAVO! Forza Italia! from Denmark."
tt2049116,"In my opinion this is an absolutely brilliant TV-series. In the beginning you get to know the characters and the Mafia business in general, but as the series develop you get a deeper insight into all the personalities, their psychology, the choices that they make and how/why their actions lead to all kinds of different sequences of events that are tragic, sad, action packed, exciting and entertaining. The environment that it's shot in suits the series perfectly and I must say that the series is better than the movie Gomorrah (which is also good). If you're a fan of series such as The Sopranos, or movies like the Godfather and Scarface, I'll guarantee you that you'll love Gomorra!"
tt2049116,"At the end of each episode there is a music track which announces the end of that show and it's a hypnotic piece of music which alerts the viewer, not just to the end of the show, but that this drama goes on; the simple melody and beat makes that clear, and in the phrase that Kurt Vonnegut used in ""Slaughterhouse 5"" , which was 'so it goes', it is a sigh, a refrain for the madness of human action, and for the terrible waste of their lives.This quality is exemplified too in the exteriors of the series: the Giorgio de Chirico exterior spaces, the dogs barking, the ugly 1960s architecture intended to make their lives better, but which is like a brutalist prison for them. No nice tree lined suburban streets for them. For the characters their daily drama is pointless and savage but its their only way to make something of the little they have.To say this series is 'dark' is an understatement; it breathes the worst of human behavior, but the manner is not to exploit, instead it shows the extent of what people endure. In this sense it is akin to 'The Wire' and its journey through Baltimore's underworld.To seek a character to 'root for' is to misjudge the value of drama: it is not a simple parable in which we can attach our aspirations to one character. If it was, Greek drama and Shakespeare, and much more besides, would have no value and most of the dross that mainstream TV and movies serve up would be the paragon of good writing. And it is not.This series may seem to glorify the savagery but it does not: it makes it clear as to the losses suffered, the moral failures, and the social divisions exposed. In this way the writers have done great work as they have with the characters.This series is quite remarkable in all the obvious production areas: it has a distinct look, the actors are all excellent without a miss, the casting choices have a reality too, and the dialect is a real pleasure too, though very hard to follow, it adds texture and depth."
tt2049116,"On flicking through the TV one night I stumbled onto this at Episode 8 (I learned later). I'm not a big fan of subtitled series, but I found the lead role's mohawk haircut interesting enough to keep me tuned in for longer than usual. The rest is history. Once you start watching Gennnaro Savastano (played by Salvatore Esposito) you will be addicted. The macho man of all macho men, he looks like he could burst you with one right hook. As if one magnetic actor wasn't enough, along comes Salvatore Conte (played by Marco Palvetti), a suave slickster with an instantly addictive accent and way of expressing himself. The action is constantly moving at perfect pace, the settings are beautifully contrasted. Everything about this series is brilliant, even the bit-part players are magnetic, one such character brilliantly named Tonino Spiderman. This is a must-own series for all gangster movie/TV series buffs, and the great thing about it is, not a lot of people know just how mind-blowingly brilliant it is."
tt2049116,"Gomorrah is one of the better crime series I've ever seen in some time. It's not the best but it's definitely worth watching. It has a 8.7 rating for a reason. I started watching it because of all the great reviews/ratings I've seen over the years and it has not disappointed! You never know what is going to happen and is like Game of Thrones in a way by the fact that they don't shy away from killing off main characters. It's not for everyone because it's a very gritty, violent, realistic show! Just a warning, once you start watching it it's hard to stop. You'll find yourself binge watching the entire series as fast as possible!"
tt2049116,"This is without doubt one of the best TV series I have ever seen – and that is without exaggeration. Although there has only been one season up to now this by far exceeds The Sopranos, The Wire and dare I say it Breaking Bad. Many a TV series starts off too slow – well this is not one of them. We get action from the get go and this only increases up until the end – where we get a magnificent finish. The storyline is great and the acting is superb. We really get to see the characters develop and the transformation of Genny is brilliantly displayed. I just hope the second season is as good as the first – because the first was great."
tt2049116,"I began watching this as I remembered watching the film and reading the Saviano book a few years ago. Both are excellent, but I feel the series is quite different and is perhaps only loosely based on the original source material. But that didn't bother me; this is a superb series. I found myself so immersed in the characters, the setting and the whole world that I had to keep reminding myself while I was at work that I wasn't a Neapolitan gangster. Every episode of the series is different, the characters are all so compelling and some of the twists and turns are gut-wrenching. Every episode ends perfectly and each one makes you feel differently - one made me weep with sentiment, another took me to such a dark place that I considered not watching any more because I realised ""even the good guys are really really bad guys"". But I'm glad I continued watching because the end of the series is phenomenal and makes me hungry for more. I have been truly blown away (excuse the pun) by this series and can pick no faults with it at all...and if you don't agree with me, I know some guys who know where you live and might be able to ""change your mind""! Also acting - amazing. All the actors are spot on. Special mention for Vincenzo Sacchettino (Danielino) who has got to be one of the best teenage actors I've seen for a long while."
tt2049116,"Probably the best most realistic series I have ever watched
Characters are utterly real - brilliant but horrifying too
Very violent - if you like that kind of thing."
tt2049116,"This is a very, very dark series that follows a Mafia clan as they do business in Naples. There are no good characters in this series as like the Biblical city of ""Gomorrah"", the inhabitants and the area of the city portrayed are just full of evil. Father is pitted against son, husband against wife, brother against brother. There is no redemption offered in the series, neither is it sought! People live their lives in evil, and die in gruesome, hideous ways. The series wont do much for tourism like other series e.g Detective Montalbano. The viewer does get very involved with each character, and follows them to their demise. Some of the scenes are beyond belief as it shows that human life has no value in the business at hand. This is not as twisted or cerebral as a Scandinavian Noir might be, it just all about the evil men do! It's worth watching if you have the stomach to do so.Season 5 has been a huge disappointment! It destroys the tradition and quality of all the previous seasons. There seems to be no script, and most of the time the actors just seem to stare and one another, saying nothing. The mood becomes more like an Art house production, and less like a Mafia series. Extremely disappointing! This has caused the rating to drop from a 9 to a 7/10."
tt2049116,"The brilliance of 'The Sopranos' (still the greatest series ever) is that it makes you care about brutal murderers. 'Gomorrah' does no such thing. There is no one to root for. No one to care about. No one to take an interest in. You want every single character to die, and the sooner the better.'The Sopranos' was also one of the funniest shows in history. There is zero humor in 'Gomorrah.' It is relentlessly darkness. It is nonstop brutality, betrayal, psychopathy, and dysfunction. The tone never changes. It is dark, upon bleak, piled on despicable, unredeemable characters.So, I cannot imagine enduring 5 seasons of this one-note series. I'm out after Season 1!"
tt2049116,"Gomorroh was so much better than I expected it to be. It's so good I'm actually mad at myself for putting it off for so long. I've read about how good this series is for years but still out it off for some reason. Well, it definitely lived up to all the hype and then some. I was hooked from the very first episode to the last. If you're a fan of crime dramas involving drug cartels then give this a try, you won't be disappointed. It is an Italian show so you'll either have to watch with subtitles or watch it dubbed in American. You'll get used to it pretty quick and forget all about it so don't let that deter you from watching it. This is seriously one of the better shows I've seen in years."
tt2049116,"This is the first time I've written a review on IMDB but I just had to tell the world how amazing this show is.
If you have even a passing interest in crime drama, the Mafia or just good quality television and you are not squeamish, then you owe to yourself to watch this show.
I have watched all of season 1 and 2 and every episode has been outstanding.
It has everything.....
An amazing story, full of twists and turns. 
A very realistic and incredibly gritty setting, nothing like the American gangster films or TV shows. 
Outstanding acting from every cast member, you will grow to love, hate and mourn.
Beautiful camera work and cinematography.
It reminds of me of The Wire, in it's realistic depiction of drug dealing at the street level. 
Like The Wire, it is not for the faint hearted. The violence is brutal and realistic but that is the nature of the beast.
If you do decide to watch it, please watch it in this original Italian, the performances are too good to be spoilt by watching a dubbed version.A big thank you to everyone involved in the making of this series. Amazing work."
tt2049116,"Mafia dramas are very common things, but Gomorra, inspired by Roberto Saviano's expose of the Neapolitan Camorra, is very good indeed, although beautiful Naples has surely never been filmed so uglily. It resembles 'The Godfather' more than it does 'The Sopranos', with its broad-arc, (soap)-operatic tone, as it tells the tale of the fall of the all-powerful Savastono clan. It's horrific, and one strength is the way its most sympathetic characters are shown to commit acts of utterly unjustifiable evil; and yet one is drawn along in a grand story arc nonetheless. The closest point of comparison is perhaps 'The Wire'; in comparison, 'Gomorra' is more poetic, less didactic, but also less multi-layered, focusing solely on the criminals and only in passing on other elements of civil society. We're two series in now, and one has to wonder if the quality will be maintained; at this point, the story lines that have driven the plot so far appear to have reached their natural ends. But to date, this has been television of the highest order."
tt2049116,"Sollima is the best director for crime drama of this generation, period. The fact someone could possibly give this gem 1 or 2 stars only speaks volume about the general dumbing down of the human population, you need to be at least not cognitively impaired to understand this masterpiece, if you are then there's michael bay for you."
tt2049116,"....They must absolutely respect their word and definitely close with the fifth season. The series is a masterpiece, direction, cinematography, actors, screenplay and above all the characters are something legendary, something that will remain in the hearts and memories of us fans as long as the series ends with the fifth season, I absolutely do not want that the series becomes a kind of sleazy endless soap opera. The best series are always the short ones."
tt2049116,"I have just watched episode 2 and I am addicted. Was not sure what to expect, I had not heard of the book or the 2008 film of the same name. After 10 minutes I could tell it was going to be well made, the setting in Naples in Italy ,the home of the camorra crime family,(changed to Gamorra by the author) and the base of the story came from a book written by Roberto savino , who lived in Naples. I say lived because at the moment he has had to move away with a bodyguard for all the fuss he has caused. His book was a best seller but that did not go down well with everyone especially the local mafia he wrote about. According to Savino the camorra nor dwarf""s the mafia of Sicily.In the first episode we get to meet the crew and family and are soon in the backstreet""s where deals are done and beatings are dished out. The story keeps you hooked ,although everything is spoken in Italian with English subtitles I instantly got into the show and remarked to a friend it was like watching a documentary rather than actors.The second episode carries on the excitement mixed with excellent acting and a strong script. I cant wait for episode 3, and would give a IMDb score of 9/10"
tt2049116,"Everything about this production is top shelf. It's unpredictable, much like the Sopranos. But it's got more grit and is faster paced than The Sopranos. The dread story weaves and surprises with violent deaths around every corner. There are what seems to be hundreds of locations, Naples revealed. The colour and understanding of colour is brilliant, movie quality. The characters are decidedly unpleasant and truly bad, but one is drawn into their fates as if by magic, testimony to the quality of the actors and their direction. The soundscape is modern and sharp, heightening the tension. If you have a soft spot for Europe and European drama, then you have possibly just found television nirvana."
tt2049116,"Make no mistake, Gomorra is no copycat version of some other gangster film or series; it is the evolution of the genre, something we haven't seen perhaps since Un Prophète (2009) by Jacques Audiard.Gomorra makes The Sopranos look as phony as Happy Days. With the feel of a filmed-on-location documentary, in this Italian series everyone looks exactly like who they are supposed to be. The locations in Napoli are grimy and gritty—hardly the Under the Tuscan Sun vision of Italy and definitely not the invented suburban fantasy gangster-land of The Sopranos. The gun battles have an air of realistic mayhem seldom seen in movies and almost never on TV. Gomorra is desperate shootouts, filthy prisons, and a penetrating look at the Southern Italian underworld. What more could you ask for? I didn't mean to disrespect The Sopranos because this series borrows heavily from that American original as well as the works of Tarantino. In the first scene there is a banal conversation between two hoods as one of them complains about his daughter's obsession with Facebook, a matter the middle-aged hit-man and parent knows nothing about. Even in this mundane and seemingly innocuous bit of dialogue we get a glimpse of the vision of Ciro, a mid-level thug. And off we go into the night, both literally and figuratively.Gomorra doesn't fall into the black hole like The Sopranos of going into the lives of the family members, a mistake now made in countless new TV series in what I call the Meadow Soprano Effect. The mafia guys all have families, as we are shown, but they don't bother much with the details and good for that. If I wanted to watch a show about family life I wouldn't be watching a crime series. In addition, there are no half hour blocks of boredom like when Tony talked with his doctor.My big regret is that I don't speak Italian, or whatever version of that language these guys speak in the streets of Napoli. Instead I had to get by on French subtitles. Thankfully, my street French had already got a big shot in the arm with the French series Braquo.The series avoids the gangster movie clichés and instead invents of few new ones which will probably soon be repeated by other filmmakers. Centering on Ciro, the mob boss's top henchman, we get an insider's view of the daily operations of the crime world of this city, sometimes glamorous, other times mundane, but always fascinating.Whoever was responsible for the locations needs a place in film heaven. The portrayal of the family life in the mob is done well without the annoying side-tracks of The Sopranos with episodes dedicated to their tedious children. Just enough for verisimilitude and that's all.Constructive Criticism. I won't back down from my rating of 10 because the series deserves that just on appearance. It looks so real and few movies I have seen come anywhere close to the verisimilitude of Gomorra. With that said there is little or no exposition for most of the violence portrayed. There is simply a paroxysm of gun blasts and someone (or many people) is dead. There is little in the way of ""why"" for a lot of the action sequences. I'd rather have a lot less violence with a better story to explain what is there. In addition, there needs to be someone approaching the part of likable, someone we actually care about. I gave up on Ciro after the murder of the young girl."
tt2049116,"I accidentally watched first episode of season 2 when I assumed it was season 1.. which explains the start.Then realizing what I saw was actually season 2, I then started watching season 1. From the first episode.. I had to put all my duties aside and spent an entire day (12+ hours) just filling my life with the whole season.I have to put this right next to Sopranos. Much better than Gomorrah movie. Definitely more valuable to me than Godfather or any other Hollywood fantasy crap that portrays Italian organized crime as baby stuff.Although any violence occurring in this show isn't as brutal as the reality is.. it still gives a touch of the brutality that the world of organized crime has, especially in the Southern part of Italy.I must recommend this for all crime genre lovers. Roberto Saviano is now listed among my top favorite screenwriters. Despite a very few list on his filmography list; he somehow managed to hit the jackpot starting with his 2008 Gomorrah story. The modern Gomorrah series is just how fantastic his story develops into a modern perspective on the Italian organized crime story he told.Apart from the creators.. acting was beyond brilliant.. no further comment!"
tt4786824,"What can I say about The Crown that hasn't already been said? It's incredible! There are some that don't like it because they take some liberties with the story but overall it's pretty accurate, especially the first few seasons. You can tell the amount of effort they put into this show from everything from the writing, acting, cinematography, production, etc. All being as good as it gets for a television show. It chronicles the life of Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family from the 1940's to modern times. It gives you an inside look at the personal lives of the royal family including their romances and political rivalries. There's a reason this show has won so many awards and that's because it's brilliant!"
tt4786824,The Crown is simply a brilliant piece of television. It's one of the most expensive shows ever made and you can tell because the production and attention to detail is amazing. I originally put off watching this because I thought it was a show aimed from women but I couldn't have been more wrong. It is for everyone! Even when they changed the main characters in Season 3 because of the time jump it didn't lose a beat. Both Claire Foy and Olivia Colman both lead amazing casts who all deserve all the praise this show gets!
tt4786824,"I have to be honest. I had refused to watch this show from the moment it was released. Being no fan of monarchies in general, or of the House of Windsor in particular, I wrongly failed to see the potential.But history always is interesting, especially when left in the hands of able writers and an absolutely spectacular cast. To a person, word for spoken word, I was drawn into this series headlong and found myself taken by this expertly crafted story.I love that the flaws and tensions that existed are exposed and leveraged. And I find myself reaching for the shelf and pulling out a book or two to refamiliarize myself with some event.In short it won me over and taught me a lesson or two in the process. What more can one ask?"
tt4786824,"Every so often a drama comes along that takes away your breath. Sometimes that's subjective, other times objective. Dramas such as The Jewel in the Crown, The West Wing, Game of Thrones, House of Cards, Downton Abbey, House M.D. have all stood at the pinnacle of television drama.The Crown is right up there at the very top. It is outstanding in every way: faultless. From brilliant dramatisation to acting to score to cinematography: everywhere you look it commands.Watch it. You won't regret it. You will remember one of those television 'moments' that come along all too rarely."
tt4786824,"I just watched the first two episodes and I already am in love with the story and characters! The acting is excellent as well as the directing, story line, costumes, sets, filming locations and everything else that has gone into the making of this series. It is well written and filmed and I am looking forward to seeing the remaining episodes. I have always been fascinated with history and this series takes you back in time. It has such powerful emotion and a lot of surprises which held my interest tremendously. So far, the episodes I saw went by quickly with me wanting to see more. If you are a history buff or interested in the Royal Family, don't miss this! It is a down to earth version of their lives and responsibilities. And so far, there are many things I did not know or appreciate. Definitely a learning experience and thank you for such a beautiful story! This is an addition to my previous post- I am now on episode 9 and if there aren't any awards for acting, I will be extremely surprised. John Lithgow's portrayal of Winston Churchill is award winning as well as Claire Foy playing the Queen. All of the acting is superb in my opinion and I don't want this series to end..."
tt4786824,Where to start is very difficult when it comes to what I can only describe as an amazing feat of production and acting. The cast are absolutely outstanding and are nothing but professional.You can tell a lot of effort has been put into the research and accuracy of the story line. The attention to detail also has to be credited.I can't find a fault and believe me I've tried. Having watched previous biopics/Dramas regarding royalty I will have to put this at the Top and that is including The Queen which again I would rate at 10/10.In summery a must watch if you are looking for a great piece of production and a stimulating story line. I would recommend this to anyone.
tt4786824,"Regardless of what you may think of the Royals Netflix has poured a ton of money into this exquisite production about the life of Queen Elizabeth. It is a show which requires fixed attention as things progress at a unhurried pace. The opening musical evolution is enchanting and never grows old. Actress Claire Foy is beautifully riveting in the role of Elizabeth; someone who wants to have a normal life and yet is made to feel her duty as Queen should be the highest priority. It has been suggested the Queen is warm, has a sense of humor, is compassionate and this portrayal conveys it. She is wise enough to realize she's going to have to forge her own way as those around her are stymied in their own limitations or ignorance. John Lithgow transforms into Winston Churchill and is equally stellar. Their scenes together are superb. If Peter Morgan's research is accurate I can fully appreciate how Princess Diana must have felt. The show is rounded out by a wonderful supporting cast. This show is my favorite Netflix production so far."
tt4786824,"I watched with bated breath as Olivia Coleman took over from Claire Foy. Coleman embodies a mature Elizabeth, one who is calcified into a Royal with a stoic countenance, dowdy wardrobe, and a hint of what the crown has given and cost her.What really blew me away was the lavish attention to detail and period. The public and private spaces are painted in luscious colors, the furniture upholstered with richly hued brocade (so are the women come to think of it). The salons and libraries decorated with massive wood furniture. It's not comfortable - you can almost feel the drafty cold circulating throughout the palace, but it is a showstopper. No wonder they wore wool sweaters and tartan wool suits while lounging about."
tt4786824,"To be very honest, when a friend told me we should watch the crown, a series about Queen Elizabeth ll life, i was not excited, im normally not a very good person to start watching a new series. However, so glad i watched this. Me and my friend watched 3 episodes, and i watched the rest on my own, latter that day. The series is exciting, fast past, amazing cast, beautifully shot, beautiful costumes. Besides all that, The Crown , have made me look with another eyes to the royal family, specially Queen Elizabeth, to be honest i did not know much about her personal life . The series shows the struggle of the royal family, and make us realise they are all people in the end, with their problems and feelings. I truly hope they will make another season, to continue this extraordinary show. Thanks Netflix."
tt4786824,"By season 3, the series has kept a high level of professionalism, acting, and story even when they changed every single actor !! Such an extraordinary series !!"
tt4786824,"The Crown boasts no action sequences or big movie stars, and yet it is one of the most expensive shows of all time. Why? Because of the sheer attention to detail. Aside from the fully historically accurate costumes and locations, the show is just gorgeous to look at. The lighting, the cinematography, and everything else visual about it is on point. It's quite apparent none of that money went to waste.The show doesn't just look gorgeous, though. It is also compelling, well written, and well performed. In fact, almost every element is perfectly executed, which means that no single one stands out above the rest, but rather they work in harmony. And that is the show's greatest success; the fact that it all comes together smoothly into a neat, binge-able, high quality package.Mind you, the reason I enjoy the Crown so much is that I knew what to expect when I went into it. This is NOT a fast-paced, action-packed, edge-of-your-seat experience. It is a character drama about the royal family. It runs at a slow pace. Yet it is gripping all the same. That's why it is so good to know that Netflix made such a large investment in this series; they're taking chances and funding original and unusual things in an era when Hollywood is afraid to do anything that isn't already an existing intellectual property. I hope that the Crown blows up like Stranger Things. I hope it gets all the attention it deserves."
tt4786824,"The first four seasons were excellent. A measured portrayal of the royal family. The fifth season is a compete hatchet job. Imelda Staunton is completely unconvincing, and the characterisation of Charles doesn't sit well. Given the recent death of the queen, putting out something that will disproportionately affect how young viewers see the monarchy is a serious responsibility. Instead, the makers of this season have seized the opportunity to mix historical fact with complete fiction and share it without any form of caveats. I've no doubt that much of what is shown will be taken as gospel by those unwilling or unable to read past the political bias oozing from every frame."
tt4786824,"The first four seasons were simply superb with some genius casting - and accents to boot. The likes of Claire Foy and Matt Smith gave the show its charisma, along with incredible actors such as Pip Torrens and Alex Jennings, etc.. All fears of Matt Smith departing were allayed when Tobias Menzies stepped into the Prince Philip role.However, Season 5 isn't quite on the money. Whilst the new queen is very good, and the Diana Spencer character unbelievably like the real Lady Di, Prince Charles is somewhat of a let down. He appears to have ditched his royal accent for that of a regular Joe. Dominic West might be conscious of portraying a crass caricature, but caricatures are what we want. Prince Philip is no longer on par either (was Charles Dance not available!?!) and James Hewitt appears to have been randomly chosen. The show is still very good, and the likes of Lady Di's character keep it together, but it's starting to feel like a BBC drama, which is a shame."
tt4786824,"Queen Elizabeth 2 just passed away and I have been binge watching almost all of Season one in the past 2 days since she died, may she rest in peace.This is so good. I don't know how I missed it when it came out back in 2016, but I'm so happy to get to watch it on Netflix now.It is riveting, beautiful, and moving, and I'm so looking forward to watching the rest.It was moving, watching the king die on the show and seeing young Queen Elizabeth first starting out, when now in real life she has passed and her son Charles is now King and taking over. Gives a real sense of time moving on and stopping for no one."
tt4786824,"This is a great series, and for older Brits (Baby boomers), the historical significance is stunning. The first series of actors did an excellent job, and now we are into the second series, and the acting just got better and better!Olivia Coleman is brilliant, as usual. The episode on the Welsh disaster in Aberfan was so well done and very sad. I intend to watch this many times as it is of high quality. I wish all TV were this good and such a high standard.Binge it!"
tt4786824,"What happened in season five?I'm 5 episodes in and they seem to have abandoned their format.Before it was real life historical events in Britain jusxtosposed against how the royal family was effected or involved.This tension created the drama.Without the historical Britain piece I am just watching boring, spoiled characters.The show really suffered this season.I was so excited for it. And it's just not the same show this season.Characters are ""all right"". But their plots droll on.There isn't enough to fill ten episodes.I'm not British, but it does sort of feel like an agenda.Or they over edited it after the Queens death so as not to ""affect her legacy."
tt4786824,"The Crown (1-4) was truly excellent. A brilliantly casted, written set of episodes, dipping into the many historical segments that have fashioned the monarchy to where it is today. What makes The Crown so appealing is the casting and acting. But, Series 5 is such a disappointment. Over-acted, badly characterised, tooth-pulling episodes that lose the once excellent sparkle it had. There are moments of excellence. John Major, The Queen in particular are outstanding. But, there are too many 'lame' representations' and storylines that drag on. Let's hope Series 6 gets back to the recipe The Crown once had and the sparkle can return."
tt4786824,"So dissapoonted from the writing and acting in the new season! Whole episodes focused on not so importnat people or events rather than the royal family. So much worse than the previous 4 seasons where the focus was on the royal family. The new casting very dissapointing, Diana actress is dissaster! They picked a handsome actor to act Charles, you watch and you don't feel the character! Also, the appearances of random characters just to show some connection with the royal family, but this goes on for half an episode and you forget what you are watching I relly feel like I wasted my time to watch this season, I really hope that the last one will be better and in line with the first 4 seasons."
tt4786824,"The Crown is one of the fascinating dramas I have watched in very recent of times. First off, the show itself is a bit slow paced but nevertheless, it generates enough amount of suspense over the episodes. The Crown may lack the twist and turning of events than many other historical dramas, but the flawless direction and impeccable acting of its actors do not allow its audiences get disappointed. Secondly, the grandeur of the show is something of a treat to the sore eyes. Netflix has not been so frugal in the making of the show and it has paid them off every penny. The costume and the furnishing of the show within are scintillating. Lastly, this show is a great history lesson for all the viewers, particularly the ones who are of younger generations. It is mostly based on true events, so that is indeed a stand-out fact of the show. Though there were some moments where it seemed a little bit exaggerated but considering its genre as a TV series, that is reasonable. The Crown has allowed its viewers to peek what lies behind the royal curtains and taught a significant truth that a royal born doesn't necessarily get to evade all the personal tribulations that all the other commoners go through. They share just as same values as the other citizens of the country."
tt4786824,"There are a lot of things i like with season 3. Most of it is good. The stories, the characters, the actors.Colman is a good actor, no doubt about it. She played the part really well.The problem for me is:Claire Foy played the part like she was born to do it. I've never seen anything like it on tv.20 hours of portraying Elizabeth II made Claire Foy the real queen in a young age for so many of us.And the fact is; Every actor who comes next needs to portray Claire Foy. Not The Queen."
tt4786824,"Could this season be any slower? They are trying to extend into another season with filler. The first episodes gave some momentum at the start, but has now descended into inane sidebars. Carriage riding...really?? The disappointments of love, stories told by the supporting characters for a whole episode? I'm so bored I can't go any further.Could this season be any slower?

tt4786824,"While I loved the first two seasons, I'm a bit disappointed with season 3. I didn't find it as exciting and engaging as the previous two, and mostly I felt really... removed from the Queen. There were very few personal episodes and scenes that really centered around her. Sure she was on screen a lot, but mostly as a participant in someone else's inner/outer conflicts. What I loved so much about the first two seasons was how much we got into the Queen's headspace, her struggle with her role, her sister, her husband, how she was trying to find her footing with government officials, as a woman, as a queen, etc... Now my feeling was that she really 'managed to disappear while wearing the crown', as Margaret had put it.
My other main issue was of course the replacement of the whole cast. Initially I was very disappointed that we're going to lose Claire and Matt and Vanessa Kirby, all of whom I had grown very much to love in their roles, and they were doing phenomenal jobs of course. Then I was a bit excited seeing all the great names involved, I love and respect Olivia Colman, Tobias Menzies is an incredibly colorful actor, Helena is one of my favorite actresses since Fight Club, and I love, worship, adore Charles Dance of course :) It was also interesting because I never watched a show before where the entire cast was changed between seasons. But sadly, I don't think this experiment worked. They all did very remarkable performances, Tobias Menzies was in particular very good as-Matt Smith-as-Prince Philip, but none of this seemed to matter. I kept missing the original cast. I couldn't drown that little twinge of constant disappointment when I saw Olivia and not Claire. When you put a character into an other actor's body, it simply isn't the same character anymore, and the wonderful first cast was a very big reason in us all falling in love with The Crown.
It also irritates me, because we didn't even jump that much ahead in time yet. They could have easily aged up the actors a little, a lot of shows have actors playing decades younger/older characters then themselves. With a little makeup and styling and practical effects they could have easily sold us the original actors as older versions of themselves. Instead everybody felt way too old all of a sudden, particulary Lord Mountbatten, who was a man in his prime and now is suddenly kind of ancient. And why did they have to reacast Michael Adeane, who was oldish to begin with? I didn't even know that was him (and Charteris) until some stray subtitle gave them away.
And I know it's a small and probably silly thing to mentoin, but the eyecolors of the new Queen and Margaret bothered me more and more with each episode. I got so used to those striking blue eyes, that their new doe-eyedness jolted me out of the story even more.
The show is of course still top-quality television, the aforementioned mistakes and faults notwithstanding, but once we're given perfection we'll expect perfection and season 3 fell short for me in that regard."
tt4786824,This show ticked all the boxes in seasons 1 and 2. The change of cast spoilt it for me (much like my fellow reviewees). I would totally love to see season 3 remade with the original cast.
tt5897304,"i loved it so so so so very much... it deserves a perfect 10, no some mere 8.0... well, when i saw this anime, i thought it was older than ONE PUNCH MAN based on the animations but after a few i got to know that it was the vice versa actually... i hope a season 2 comes up soon... the characters were all awesome... the lead Shigeo Kageyama was marvellous, and so were his master and Dimple... its one of a kindgive it a try, everyone, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT..."
tt5897304,"Get ready to be inspired, mesmerised and thoroughly entertained by the most visually and musically satisfying show that's not only gonna tickle your funny bone but make you fall in love with the extraordinarily ordinary leading character Mob, who is relatable on so many levels. If you're looking to laugh your ass off and not be able to take your eyes off of the screen and be unable to switch off an infectious intro and outro from playing in your head, this show is for YOU."
tt5897304,"It's a shame that this show was overshadowed by Yuri On Ice back in 2016 when it came out, because this show is fantastic! 
 The animation is creative and good quality, the soundtrack is one of my favorites out of any media, the characters are well developed, the pacing is good, and it's a relatable story line without just being about a crush in high school. ONE's stories are always told well in a creative way, and his trademark overpowered characters are handled really well.
 Mob Psycho also presents a good message that a lot of anime with OP characters tend to mess up; that your powers/skills don't make you any better than anyone else. Mob at a young age is told that psychic powers are the same as having any other talent or skill, like being good at math or sports. This is refreshing as a lot of main characters are constantly being told that they're special in some way, good or bad, because of their powers.
 Another refreshing part of the story is that kids actually ask adults for help, and the adults help them. It may sound stupid, but think of how many shows have a plot line where the adults: A. don't understand, B. aren't told anything, or C. refuse to help for no reason. Probably a lot, right? Mob Psycho has actual RESPONSIBLE adults in it. Revolutionary.
 These are just a few of the nice changes from the norm to come out of Mob Psycho 100, but there are plenty more and I'd highly suggest watching it!"
tt5897304,"I had no expectations towards this series and I was so glad to be surprised. The story is amazing. Very funny and interesting. Best master ever. I really like One Punch Man, but I'll have to agree that this is better. After seeing Mob Psycho, it's very clear the author was taking this one to heart and One Punch Man was just something to have fun with. This is serious writing, even if the show is kind silly. I hope he can keep both series going. This one is a treat to people who like well crafted stories."
tt5897304,"I started this anime going in completely blind after getting my dose of OPM - after watching the first few minutes of the first episode, I was hooked. The use of different mediums of animation techniques both in traditional cell animation and WC distortion blew me away as an animator myself. Recommended this series to my brother whom doesn't resonate with anime as much as myself and he absolutely loved it too!The slapstick humour can be a bit obnoxious at times but I see it as part of PM100s charm.. the animation fits it perfectly and it just makes it stand out from every other AAA anime out right now. My new favourite thing. ONE/BONE Studios is proving to be an outstanding competitor(s) in the anime ""game of thrones""."
tt5897304,"ONE does it again with another brilliant action show, bringing humor and heart along for the ride. The messages are positive, and there are some great role models here too! As for gore, it isn't as severe as OPM, a previous creation by ONE. No sexual content, the slightest thing that comes close is a ghost haunting someone because they keep going to, lets say R RATED websites. Language is fair. SUGGESTED MPAA RATING: Rated PG-13 for Paranormal action, violence, and language"
tt5897304,"I've never felt the need to write a review before. However, I was shocked at how low this series has been ranked. As someone who loved One Punch Man and feels it deserves its high ranking, let me tell you that Mob Psycho 100 is a superior anime.I can sum up why Mob Psycho 100 is better in one phrase; it's more relatable. Mob is a socially awkward kid with no talents, popularity, or interesting qualities other than his immense psychic powers. In order to have a fulfilling life, he has to force himself down the hard road to becoming a better person. All the while meeting people who have let power turn themselves into empty husks.The animation while not as highly detailed as One Punch Man, was incredibly creative and expressive, spanning a half a dozen different mediums. There were no dull boring still scenes in this anime."
tt5897304,"This is honestly one of the best anime shows that has 2 great openings, 2 great season's and includes the best voice actors (I watched both sub and dub versions).For those who never heard of this show before or is a fan of the superpower genre, get watching this like truly.........It's freaking epic man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
tt5897304,"If you're here and you're wondering if you should watch this anime, please do. I can't emphasize this enough. I can't believe it took me so long to watch it. Just do it. You won't regret it"
tt5897304,"One is one of the best writers of our time! He gave us not one, but two action packed and hilarious comedies with a lot of heart and emotion. But between this and OPM, I would definitely prefer this! A great history with some of the best characters the anime industry has to offer (Specially Shigero Kageyama or Mob) and all packed into a anime with THE BEST 2D ANIMATION OF ALL TIME (And that includes movies like The Lion King and Prince of Egypt) and a great soundtrack and we have a anime giant! A must watch if you like action and/or comedic shows!"
tt5897304,"I never anticipated that this third season's plot would take such a radical, philosophical turn as a parody of the protagonist's boundless energy and might. Well done! The character is written so brilliantly that, in my opinion, that was the biggest twist.One can only enjoy the anime's animation technique; yet, I find the script to be utterly captivating. The writing from the moral point of view is amazing.I strongly advise anyone who stopped watching it after seasons one and two to watch season three as well. Dude, you're missing out on so much. This has a lot of promise. I'm compelled to desire more of it!Get moving!"
tt5897304,One punch dumbness is also in mob too which is the funny part of the story. Or you can say that mob psycho 100 is a childhood part of saitama. Nothing special in short.Just trying to teach us peace and be helpful to others. Which I like about it.Saitama one punch atleast watchable bcoz of other characters & tremendous action.... This is just 10% of one punch.
tt5897304,First season is fine and interesting you like it. As it overpower hero like Sitama but with different nature and can solve anything easily.But The second season is incredible if anyone give this show less then 10/10 then it is crime. Every episode * sweet lesson of life and actual development of character i.e. MOB. He turning more mature day by day and most of lesson give you tear of joy.
tt5897304,"This is, without exaggerating, the best summer anime for this year, maybe the best anime for the year... the plot is epic, credits to ONE, regardless to the well-known series of One Punch Man which also scored a high rating too...The style of animation, that looks kinda ""Weak"", is not. The studio included a very high rate of FPS which makes the animation smooth, and the drawing style itself fits the story and the characters better ! Just imagine if it were detailedly drawn like One Punch Man, it wouldn't have that charm...Long story short, all hail Mob Psycho !"
tt5897304,"A new modern anime classic.. i had a hard time finding an anime i liked after i started off the genre by watching death note, then FMA Brotherhood. yes i set the bar high. until i saw Mob Psycho 100. its got action , comedy and definitely keeps you interested. superb storytelling and comedic value is on point never cheesy like other anime. DONT watch the live-action netflix adaptation though. Also, if you like MP100 i high'y recommend one punch man and jojo's bizarre adventure."
tt5897304,"This is a hilarious anime that really leans into what it means to be animated. The movements and action scenes are well-chorographed and expressive. The characters are interesting, and there isn't a single element that falls flat on its face (I mean Mob does that a few times but still). Anything I could say about this show is would just be repetitive praise. I would highly recommend watching this one."
tt5897304,"When talking about adolescence in anime, it's always something forced, girls bullying you with their big breasts (however, a girl who bullies you is in love with you), even with things. American
But with mob it's different, here we see an introverted young man, who doesn't know how to get along with other people, however, he has paranormal powers, but he doesn't like them, mob just wants to live a normal life.And he goes through a lot of stuff and stuff, that if you have more than 12 years, you know (except if you have 50 years old, and pass your entire adolescense in vietnam war)This anime has an incredible balance of comedy (it made me laugh, I admit) and action (fights with incredible animation made by studio bones, the same studio behind Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, another anime that I love)
Just watch, that's it.Oh, and while I'm writing this review, the last episode of the third season and the anime has just been released (the second best episode)"
tt5897304,"A horrendous start to an otherwise interesting story. Would have lost interest in the series if it weren't for a friend who had watched the entire show. However things started to turn around at about episode 5. The fight scenes in this anime are fun and overall nice to watch. The characters are very well developed, and the way the anime jokes around with certain things are really fun, got quite a few laughs from the series. The story about the two parts of Kageyama is a very unique and interesting way to tell the story, and overall it turns out very nice with the last episode being a banger. Not my favourite anime by a long shot, but still a very good one, and I am glad that I watched it."
tt5897304,"Kudos for making morons (Like Eric Trump and his followers) believe that there is a secret liberal conspiracy when internet engine searches bring images from this series when they type the word ""mob"".Amazing, really."
tt5897304,"Mob Psycho 100 is about a 14 Year old boy, who has psychic powers. It is a Slice of life anime.It is made by ONE, he is also the creator of One Punch ManThe animation is good and fluid, but I would prefer if it was less brighter.The plot of this show is not the best. It is quite messy and boring. The dialogue is mundane. The characters are really boring and unlikable, Mob and his brother especially,. The villains are average."
tt5897304,"One of 2016 best anime,by far,as good or better than One Punch Man"
tt3590338,"I'm not big on reviews, but I want to let Netflix know how great this show is and that we can't wait for a new season (for real, please!). The animation is beautiful, the message is moral, the premise is quasi educational. Compared to so much bright junk out there for kids, with no message or bad ones to boot, Puffin Rock is a show that I am confident in letting my child watch and enjoy. The music is very catchy and my daughter is always asking me to ""sing Oona's song daddy"" which is fun and short. The way they do episodes is also great for younger kids since they are 3 mini episodes in each 20 min episode. Come and play!Keep it coming please!"
tt3590338,"This is my 2 year old's favourite show along with Sesame Street. He calls the show ""Baba!"" Very good for adults too, super cute, we love the graphics, we are actually fans of the soft brushed graphics contrary to another reviewer. If this looked like every other show it wouldn't be as special. We also LOVE the actor who plays the narrator, great accent and very good narration. The show consists of 3 short stories that usually educate on a subject or has a morale at the end. Having it on in the background is not just tolerable, but enjoyable. We are confident that the content is appropriate for our son and the lessons are ones we want him to learn. Great great show!"
tt3590338,"Netflix is getting more and more series and films that appeal to all ages and audiences. I stumbled on this series while looking for something new to watch. I know it is for very young children and I (usually, but not always) prefer adult-oriented series like ""Trailer Park Boys"" and ""BoJack Horseman"". Matter of factually, nobody can resist puffins, the adorable clowns of the Northern seas. The series focuses on two baby puffins and their lives with on an island. The animation is flash, but it has a storybook look and aesthetic, that reminds me of the artwork of Mary Blair and Charley Harper. Not only is the animation and characters just adorable, but you also learn about puffins, their lives, and habitats. It cleverly mixes facts about puffins and other animals with simple storytelling, that makes the series very enjoyable for anyone!"
tt3590338,"This is by far the best kids cartoon I've seen for its intended age group. There are no loud noises or overwhelming bright colors. All the characters are likable and not annoying or obnoxious like so many cartoon characters. The animation is a nice change from the usual CGI and very soft and pretty. The music is charming and peaceful. And what's not to love about puffins and other cute furry creatures? As you know kids like to watch the same cartoons over and over and over, but with this one I don't mind having it on repeat at all. I actually enjoy watching this program with my kids as opposed to just tolerating it."
tt3590338,"The most charming animation series I've ever seen on Netflix comes from the animators of ""The Secret of Kells"" and ""The Song of the Sea."" It is also the first series I've ever seen on Netflix. This series follows two young Atlantic puffins, Oona and her younger brother Baba, as they embark on several adventures on their island home on the Irish coast with their animal pals on land and water.I'm afraid there is nothing else to say about this series other than that I love little Baba's ""Baba-WOO!"" So anyway, I found the animation beautiful and the story lighthearted. Overall, I really love this cartoon series."
tt3590338,"We love this show. My 3yo is obsessed with watching Una and the gang. He doesn't want to watch anything else lately, and is sad that there are only two seasons. Great work on the animation, the plots are teachable, content is fun and amazingly addicting, and characters become part of your family!"
tt3590338,"So nice that a show like this exists...one that educates on animals & nature, and doesn't include bad language or violence. My kids absolutely love it and I love that it focuses so much on family & friendships."
tt3590338,"Gorgeous color choice and original animation. Sweet characters, great lessons, fantastic narration by Chris O'Dowd! My 2 1/2 year old daughter absolutely adores the show. We both love the animals and learning about them throughout the show. Great job Ireland for sharing this great show, and Thank you Netflix for having foreign shows such as this, that are not as mindless as some American children shows that I have seen offered!"
tt3590338,"Please keep this show Netflix! I love the music, the story lines, the characters. My son has started singing along to the themes and it is the sweetest! Perfect, simple and sweet show."
tt3590338,"This is a fab show, I enjoy it as much as my 3 yr old...who's been watching it for a year and still isn't bored with... brighter am I....
It's gentle, funny and non violent...you learn of family, friends about different animals can't recommend enough...just wish they would make more"
tt3590338,Chris O'Dowd putting you to sleep while talking about puffins is perfection.I can only say: thank you.
tt3590338,"My little girl absolutely loves this show, she has watched them all repeatedly and keeps asking when there will be new episodes. As well as always asking for Puffin Rock toys, which they do not make.
The show itself is heartwarming and sweet, we all quite enjoy it. Please make more episodes of this wonderful show!"
tt3590338,"We absolutely love Puffin Rock! The characters are adorable, the narrator is funny, the voices are soothing (not the least bit annoying) and the music is beautiful. It is honestly a joy to have this show occasionally in the background during our day. My favorite part is that it is also educational. My daughter loves this show!"
tt3590338,"For our 2 year old its the only series that she is enthralled by. The voices, accents and sounds are calm and relaxing as opposed to most of the other kiddies shows. This by far has taught our daughter so many words and concepts. Also great to have the Irish voice of O Dowd and the cute voicees for Una, young baba, mossie and silky. The visuals are easy on the eye and beautifully illustrated. Even the animation is gorgeous and not 3D thankfully
Bring on more like this. Well done to the whole crew on this."
tt3590338,"Been watching this with my 2yo, he loves animals and is currently learning words. This show is teaching him a lot of new words (and letting him practice some old favorites like fish). It also helps that the show is appealing to adults too with it's lovely art style and likable characters!"
tt3590338,"I have no idea what this show is about - but my daughter loves it. Its one of her on and off morning rituals before heading to school. I am usually sitting next to her while shes watching them and she is excited about the characters and seems to be really focused on everything that's happening.The narration and graphics are great, and are perfect for a kid who is waking up - not too loud or crazy but a storyline for a 6 year old to follow while eating breakfast and adapting to the morning to come. I would recommend this show for anyone with children who are looking for something with wholesome content.A+"
tt3590338,"PUFFIN ROCK (2015-2016) is a really cute children's show. A gem among gems. It's really sweet, mellow and pretty enjoyable for any age. Even I, as an adult find it charming and watchable. The art style, the characters, the stories are all so well crafted. There is a definite artististic aesthetic making this series visually appealing, as well as moral and educational teachings throughout. This series is better than the 99% of the other fluff mass produced for children these days. It doesn't rely on flashy, cheap CGI or low brow humor to keep the kids entertained. You don't feel like you're loosing brain cells by watching it. Like a refreshing breath of air.""Puffin Rock follows the adventures of Oona, her little brother Baba, and their family and friends on a gorgeous and wild Irish island.""Puffin Rock is a quality show, one most adults might find enjoyable as well. Highly recommend this series. Such a great series. We need more like this!"
tt3590338,"This is my first ever review on imdb and only because this show really deserves it. The colors, the stories, the pacing and most importantly the characters make it really special. This is the only netflix shot that really deserves to be renewed for more seasons."
tt5421602,"And not just in terms of cinematography (which makes you want to pack your bags and head to Prince Edward Island right this second), but also in terms of the the heart and soul that has been put into the show which is clearly evident. Without spoiling anything this show has -
Heartfelt storylinesStunning soundtrack that can move mountainsGorgeous cinematographyRealistic takes on identity, bullying, prejudice, racism, sexismDialogues that resonate deeplyCathartic narrativeComedy that not only makes you laugh out loud but is also so humane that it leaves you smiling long afterAbove all, in a time where tv shows and movies are serving way too much dark and dystopian content, to the point they've crossed the saturation point, Anne with an E remains realistic AND hopeful, which makes its effects long-lasting
and its content ageless.
Go binge it on Netflix right now. You'll not regret it."
tt5421602,"This is one of my favourite shows.I loved the old version and this one is a beautifully updated version of that story. I see a lot of hate written from purist with no scope of imagination, who dislike this. However, it is about time that we accept the fact that rural 1900's Canada was not all flowers, red roads and poetry.This modern version does not look through rose coloured glasses so we can edit out what we don't want to admit (like LGTBQ people existed back then too, First Nations and African people were wronged terribly and women were oppressed) and yet while addressing these injustices it was still true to Anne of Green Gables core ideas. The love of family and friends.The chemistry between Marilla, Mathew, Anne, Gilbert and Diana is perfect and I can't think of a show that has moved me to happy tears more than they have. It is an injustice to trash this show just because it doesn't fit perfectly into the mold of the old show or book. After all Anne didn't fit into anyones mold and that is why so many people love her.I read recently that the show has been cancelled and a deeply disappointed. This show was so good at portraying a real family, with real struggles all the while keeping with what makes Anne of Green Gables so special, that I feel as though I am losing a part of mine. I will miss it."
tt5421602,This is one of the most beautiful shows I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the books and though it differs from the books it truly is the closest to perfect television we have gotten in the past 10 years or so. It tackles modern day issues that have been alive throughout time and does so in a thought provoking fascinating way. The acting and production are second to none and it truly deserves another season to continue the storytelling. Anne Shirley Cuthburt is a passionate individual and so are her fans! She is a true role model for every young person today.
tt5421602,"One of the best shows I have ever watched I highly recommend it to everyone doesn't matter what age you are. Everyone will find something interesting in it. Amazing acting, scenography, costumes, music and of course storylines"
tt5421602,"I was such a huge fan of the Megan Follows depiction of the beloved character Anne. This depiction is also superb. So moving and so much more emotion than the former. They cannot be compared, one no less better than the other. Different but oh so excellent and beautifully acted. I love it!"
tt5421602,"There aren't enough words to describe how much this show means to me. Watching this show has brought me so much hope and happiness. I will forever be eternally grateful for this show and I can only hope that Netflix can find it in their hearts to give us one more season. If you're looking for something lighthearted to watch or just a new show in general, please watch Anne With an E. You won't regret it. The storylines and characters are amazing and they show just how much hard work was put into creating this show."
tt5421602,"It is true that we never got over the cancellation of ""Anne With An E"", one of the most acclaimed series by the public over the last few years. The production, based on the book ""Anne of Green Gables"", by Lucy Maud Montgomery, was a joint responsibility of the CBC channel and Netflix.The whole plot is centered on the transformation of Anne's life, an orphan who, after years of experiencing a series of humiliations by the current social assistance system, is going to live with a single woman and her brother.The program had a strong optimistic message, especially due to the fact that the protagonist, in the meantime, not only revolutionizes her own reality, but also that of her adoptive family and everyone around her.Now, on the night of last Wednesday (22), the website ScreenRant published an article in which it commented on the reasons why the production would have been taken off the air. According to CBC executive Sally Catto, the registered audience numbers were below expectations and failed to reach the age group between 25 and 54 years - which corresponds to the broadest audience of the broadcaster and, consequently, would jeopardize its continuity.The fans, in turn, continue to cheer for the production to return on another channel or platform. We sign below and await news! It doesn't hurt to dream, right?"
tt5421602,"Anne with an E manages to bring up topics that we rarely see in period dramas. It shows the importance of family, friends, nature, and above all, staying true to yourself. You fall in love with the characters so easily, but they aren't portrayed as perfect, everyone has their flaws but I think that's why so many people are able to relate to them. Anne has made me a better person. I've started to appreciate things I didn't before, it's like I got a new pair of eyes. Nonetheless I recommend it to everyone, no matter the age, give it a try. It will only do you good."
tt5421602,"I just came around this page to check for the airing date of episode two and saw there were no reviews yet. So I created an account to write my first review on IMDb, long overdue but definitely worth given the treasure this series is promising to offer.It is hard to say what exactly makes this series so great. Based on one of the strongest books I read as a child, there certainly is a great base for the story, yet -- as with any adaption of a classic -- just as much a chance to get it all wrong. Luckily, as much as can be said after the first episode, I think we are in for a real treat.Lets start with the characters. Amybeth McNulty as Anne comes around like an incarnation out of my childhood imagination. Her performance is inspiring, intoxicating and captivating, just as much as the description of Anne in the books of L.M. Montgomery. Geraldine James and R.H. Thomson are performing just as great, both their roles are very minimal in expression but so much on the point. I have not had such an emotional roller coaster in a long time -- and I am ever so glad to see that while almost every other of the great TV series of our time requires war, violence, a terrorist plot, plenty of guns or at least tough bad-asses up to whatever even tougher stuff, a story about a young imaginative and poetic girl searching and fighting for her place in the world, is outperforming everyone else around.That said, I think this series comes at a very important point in time. It certainly is the story of a strong, intelligent and confident young girl refusing to accept the role a girl supposedly should have in her world, constantly questioning and exploring. We cannot have enough of these kinds of role models. It also is so great to listen to her language, so colorful and descriptive and so much richer than most of what is being aired today. It is the joy about every small wonder that Anne is discovering and describing on her journey, that is contagiously reaching out to me as a viewer, and I celebrate her perspective for its positiveness. More scope for the imagination is what we need!"
tt5421602,"The show is well made, acting is good, sets are nice. However, modern media has once again ruined a timeless classic by injecting it with their modern ideas and dilemmas and social issues. Don't get me wrong, a show about a young girl in the late 1800s dealing with abuse and hardship and all the struggles involved growing up in that time sounds like a great show. But it is NOT Anne of Green Gables. This is supposed to be a happy, wholesome show that teaches life lessons. Not this mangled mess. They're just capitalizing on the Anne franchise name. Another big issue is Anne's character. She is so unlikeable, cringey, manipulative and conniving. That is so wrong. Yes, book Anne lies sometimes and has a temper, but the show could not have gotten her more wrong."
tt5421602,"Anne with an E is exactly the show that we need in our world today. It deals with all kinds of important topics such as residential schools, women's rights, black history, and the LGBTQ community. It does so in an heart warming, educational, and kid friendly manner. Anne with an E is also brilliantly made in every department from casting to costume design to cinematography. It is a fabulous Canadian show that everyone show that everyone should watch"
tt5421602,"I was a child of the 80's and grew up in a household with a single television set. As a result, I was forced to endure many hours of the Anne Of Green Gables video collection courtesy of my two sisters. They were absolutely hooked on what is widely considered to be the definitive dramatization of L.M. Montgomery's books. To be honest, I did enjoy it (as well as developing a slight crush on Megan Follows) but don't tell my sisters that. So I approached this reboot with a due sense of caution and cynicism. I'm overjoyed to say that the first installment of Moira Walley-Beckett's (Breaking Bad) new vision, simply titled 'Anne' is just sensational.Wally-Beckett, along with director Niki Caro and producer Miranda de Pencier, deliver a more mature, detailed and sober depiction of the timeless classic in a movie length episode. While still staying true to the books this shrewd trio have dispensed with Disney-like sugary sentimentality of previous versions in favour of a slightly bleaker yet more accurate view of life in early 1900's Nova Scotia.The casting of three of the three leads, Amybeth McNulty as Anne, Geraldine James as Marilla Cuthbert and R.H. Thomson as Matthew Cuthbert was absolutely spot on. McNulty in particular brings an extra layer to the story with her invigorating portrayal of the title character. I laughed out loud several times as she perfectly captured the tragic comedy of Anne's muddled arrival to Green Gables. However don't be surprised if you have to reach for the tissues a couple of times too.This is still a story for kids and young adults but the older folks will get a big kick out of this new razor sharp adaption. I can't wait for episode two!"
tt5421602,I loved the books Anne of Green Gables. This is a great series and I am not put off by the embellishments added to the stories in the books. In fact the books left me wanting more. This is worth watching.
tt5421602,"This show is fantastic. Gorgeous cinematography, lovely music, fantastic characters, and excellent acting. It has something for all age groups. My elementary -aged daughters and I both love it."
tt5421602,"PLEASE RENEW THIS AMAZING SERIES!
It discusses so much topics that are of importance. Season 3 is the best one yet, and I believe this can only get better!"
tt5421602,"What an adventure. I loved every single character. Beautiful scenery, beautiful tales of love in its very ways. I fell in love with the main characters right away. 10/10"
tt5421602,"If you want to cry, laugh, empathize strongly with the beautifully written characters and cheer for them, this show is definitely for you!""It's not what the world holds for you, it's what you bring to it. And you bring so much...""AnnE definitely has a strong emphasis on the family life, friendships and HEALTHY relationships, not the toxic kind you see in a lot of shows nowadays.. Also I love how we see ""non-traditional"" families there: brother and sister with an orphan girl, a man with a newly born baby raising it with his friend who is like a brother to him, an elderly woman giving home to a young boy who ran away from his unaccepting family..I watched with my mom and I think we bonded over it.. made us realize some things, and we heard some stuff we rally needed to hear...Plus the wonderful soundtrack and cinematography ahh! Beautiful show, just beautiful..."
tt5421602,"I read the books when I was third and fourth grade; watched the previous miniseries and movie adaptations, and am thoroughly enchanted by this new series. Amybeth McNulty embodies Anne in new light and delivers a fully-formed character. Three episodes in and I am hooked on the evolution of so many characters.The child actors are phenomenal and treated with great detail and continuity. The simple route would be less dimensional school pupils, but this series brings them all into view fully formed, with great individuality.Three episodes in and I'm falling in love with the elderly couple who adopted Anne in a very real way. Geraldine James portrayal is unfolding quietly and convincingly. She is helping to complete the heart of this tale and the charm of it is that the character of Marilla seems as surprised by it as we are.What a phenomenal effort."
tt5421602,"It's hard to score this series without considering its ideological roots. Good music, fine cast and well written story of the first season has been exchanged for boring, tedious and unnecessary indoctrination in the second. It's not the fact that they choose to change the original story. It's not even for what they have chosen to add... it's how it was done. I felt like I was on unconscious bias course. ""This is a gay person DO NOT BY ENY MEANS SAY OR THINK ANYTHING WRONG ABOUT HIM/HER"".Ann is enlightened teenager with nothing but ""love"" in her heart for anyone in the world even for oppressed gay people. Enough of it already... we get it: We are all ""people kind""."
tt5421602,"Starts off very well. Beautiful location. Heartwarming story. Unfortunately, by the middle of series two, we have a number of story arcsintroduced that I highly doubt were in the original books. Perhaps it is due time we all moved on from the late 1800s and into a modern re-making.If you like your classic childrens books progressively advanced to cover LGBT and feminist positive content then you will enjoy this production immensely.As usual the main male characters are deeply flawed - cowards, thieves, prideful, bullies, drunks, or sanctimonious (plus a MAP). They are appropriately brought to their knees or self-recognition of their failings.I won't rate it lower, as I didn't continue watching beyond S2E5, and I'm happy to leave it with some good memories. Who knows where it goes from there.As usual, a series can rapidly go downhill. This seems to be one of them."
tt5421602,"Honestly, I wouldn't mind this show if it wasn't trying to pretend that it's Anne of Green Gables. Interesting storylines and ideas, good drama, but the only thing the characters share with the original are their names. While I am sure that Anne's life wasn't really as rosy as it is painted in the books, Anne saw life that way, she saw the magic in everything. Making a 'realistic' or 'darker' Anne is completely unnecessary and goes against the nature of the stories. I would like this show if it had any other source material. The main actress cannot pull off Anne's sense of wonder, she is awkward to watch at times. The pacing of the show is also very strange."
tt6963504,Loved his return from the shadows. Been missing Dave's say-it-how-it-is comedy style. He's not afraid to go places others dare not travel and this Netflix special is no exception. Check it out!
tt6963504,I laughed so hard at Dave. I hope Netflix allows him to do more specials. Seriously!!!
tt6963504,Still funny insightful and edgy. He's still got it!
tt6963504,"Not sure if that is something that makes sense to say - so many years after ... so no pun intended. But here we are and because his new special was released a few days ago ... I thought I'd give some ""older"" specials a go to. And this double parter was one of the things I watched with him. The first ""episode"" has his OJ phase - or meetings. With some funny anecdotes of course.But only funny if you are not easily offended. Because OJ is one thing, but he also adds some other people. Like Bill Cosby ... and it is not easy to talk about him. With all the alleged stuff he has done - and while many may think that OJ is guilty for what he was charged ... it is tougher to make that case ... with Bill on the other hand ... he has paid his accusers and there have been so many, it is tough to deny them and maybe even tougher not to believe all the women that came out and telling their stories.But even with that he is able to find a joke ... a joke he plants very early on ... and get to sow at the end ... yes he knows about circling back ... the man is good ... but you probably already knew that."
tt1877895,I really enjoyed watching the documentary. The movie shows different lives of Indian people and many sided from Indian society. Its beautiful to follow the thoughts of the young students and its inspiring how one person can create such a meaningful project. I really hope this will go on for a century and i wish them the best of luck.
tt1877895,"A beautifully well-done film depicting the lives of 5 girls growing up at Shanti Bhavan Children's Project. A touchingly sweet and sometimes heartbreaking film, Daughters of Destiny breaks down barriers for women and girls around the world and will empower viewers to champion these causes. Definitely a must-see for anyone passionate about education, children, girl's rights, and equal opportunity!"
tt1877895,"This series took me completely by surprise. I stumbled across it by chance and it truly changed my life. So refreshing--upon a mostly superficial entertainment landscape comes this flash of genius. Watch this show if you want any of the following: 1) to be inspired by individuals who have thoughtfully and intentionally set most of their lives aside to change the future of India; 2) be humbled by (and reminded of) the plight of those who are categorized as untouchables in India; or 3) be extremely impressed by the insightful writers of this show who have put a lot of skill and thought into how to best present their amazing subject matter to the Western world.Thank you to all who were involved in the making of this remarkable series. I have recommended this show to all my friends and some of us are now watching it for our ""book group,"" (yes, instead of reading a book . . . it's that good.)"
tt1877895,"An awesome documentary that gives us an opportunity to correct they why we think. Once we see the lives of the children and backgrounds that they come most of us will feel that we have ""Privileged"" lives and what are we complaining about? A great effort to showcase not only the lives of some underprivileged children but also the NGO that runs Shanti Bhavan.
No amount of appreciation is more for the NGO that runs Shanti Bhavan & the teachers there. They are the real superheroes in real life, who are really making a difference in our society. I feel we as a society should give them the credit they deserve and contribute to the development of the underprivileged. They making is really good and most of narratives are presented by the people involved. It was a real soul enriching journey for me watching these 4 episodes."
tt1877895,"A documentary based on a true story that follows 5 Daughters of Destiny - from so-called Dalit caste and their struggles and passions for education..the story develops at shanti Bhavan founded by an NRI Mr Abraham.. beautifully shot with 'fly on the wall' camera ..
It does a splendid job of conveying a sense of both place and dichotomy of place.. Reminds me of my experience at 'footpath Shala' at Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India..."
tt1877895,"Amazing, inspiring and selfless work done by Abraham George, his family and Shanti Bhavan volunteers. The documentary is very interesting and shot very well. The english of the kids is so good and they are so positive and very matured thinking, hats off to the teachers who have been imbibing these qualities in them 🙏🙏. The kids are so cute and so responsible.Thanks to Abraham and all the contributors of this wonderful school for poor families, may God bless them and all the kids abundantly with happiness, good health and success 🙏🙏🙏
Thanks to Netflix too 🙏🙏"
tt1877895,"The documentary spanning over 7 years, makes the change Dr Abraham and Shanti Bhavan created extremely tangible and obvious. But even before the stars got their jobs in the documentary, I was awestruck by their eloquence in speaking English and their extremely sharp minds.The stories of these girls are so genuine and inspiring. The documentary constantly paints the contrasting lives they live in Shanti Bhavan and back at their homes. The challenges they had overcome and the burden they carry of freeing their families were really moving.I'm not going to reveal too much. I want you to feel the way I did, and its pure magic!"
tt1877895,"I gave this such a high rating as I really want people to watch it. It is brilliantly made, never over the top or 'in your face', just beautifully put together. I love that it was made over many years, and I can imagine how difficult it must have been to get it right, with so much material. The story will stir up all your emotions over the episodes and whatever state it leaves you, you will know that you have watched something pure and beautiful."
tt1877895,"Education is an important tool for any country to lift her people out of proverty but what Dr. George is what doing can be compared to likes of Mother Theresa. So unselfish in his approach and vision to lift people out of proverty, inequality, and patriarchal society system totally commendable. I am an atheist, I don't believe in miracle or blessing, but what Shanti Bhavan to our society is beyond definition of God stature.Talking about the mini-series, story of Shanti Bhavan told thru life of Dr. George, his teachers and children. As I navigate through episode, my eyes welled up and throat crackle. Wish continuing success to Shanti Bhavan."
tt1877895,"This documentary is amazing. It is about a successful businessman who launched on a journey to give up his career and use all of his earnings to follow his dream of establishing a 'dream school' where only the poorest of the poorest families get a chance to send one of their children to receive a very quality education so they could then study, earn a living and get a change to give back to their own communities and hence break the cycle of 'being stuck with fate' in India.It is extremely moving to see the motivation of the founders, teachers and the opportunities it provides for the children. There are things that make you think about and wonder the psychological effects on children of being separated from families at a young age and the pressure on children and young adults of high expectations of success but the initial idea and dream is wonderful, so-obviously worth pursuing and clearly implemented with full good intentions that I hope it lasts through generations and does not die out or lose its steer.It is true that nothing and nobody is perfect and neither is Shanti Bhavan, nor the founders. There may be stories we did not hear of - perhaps of children who had to drop out of the school and perhaps doomed into a psychological decay - we do not know any of that. So my only criticism would be that the documentary could have been a bit more objective giving short reflections of other children but overall truly an amazing documentary about amazing people with amazing goals. Highly recommend everyone to watch this."
tt1877895,"DAUGHTERS OF DESTINY
4 Part Documentary Series
Shot over 7 years
Streaming on Netflix.When a film, in this case a documentary series, which should have been a positive and feel good experience for the viewer, leaves you not exactly sad, but certainly with an overwhelming sense of poignant melancholia, how do you explain that? All the intensions of the people involved are good, and in the end things works out well too... but listening to the four students speak of their lives, in a tone lacking exuberance, a pall of gloom seems to fall over the entire film. This despite them having finally achieved much and are ready to take on the world.Has the creator of the series, DAUGHTERS OF DESTINY, Vanessa Roth, failed? It is unfortunate, because it is in the hands of the director to extract the information in whichever tone she wishes. It is for her to alternate between light-heated episodes, which am sure there were many, along with the grim stories of existential anxieties in their lives.The series is the story of SHANTI BHAVAN, a boarding school set up near Bengaluru, by an NRI, which offers education to the underprivileged sections of society. The way they operate is very novel and if I might add, experimental.
The policy of the establishment is to pick only one child, from about 20 impoverished families each year, at the age of 4, and educate them through school, college and sometimes postgraduation, till the point s/he starts working. It is instilled into the children, all the while, that once they are done with their education, their main aim in life is to give back to society, starting with educating their siblings, lifting their own families out of poverty, and finally their communities.The story of the institution is told through the eyes of four students - all exceptionally articulate, with remarkable clarity of thought.The children experience a sense of achievement and also disappointment. I won't go into the exact nature of their experiences, but leave it for the viewer to find out. What makes it worse, is that the management itself, goes through periods of financial instability, putting the lives of the students into uncertainty.I do wish that the series had given as much time and footage to the good times the children and management have on their journey, rather than make it entirely morose and angst-ridden."
tt1877895,"The 5 stars is for how the documentary was made. I give it a 5/5. It is honest, down to the bones, extremely detailed and as a viewer was happy to see people helping their kind. It is definitely a positive documentary to follow, no doubt about it. The children have been very co-operative to the documentary makers and I hope they made it well to support their family and Shanti Bhavan.Now here is the downside, I am not against Christianity or any religion for that matter. But what I don't believe in is inclining to one religion can offer them better redemption which is what this movie tries to tell you subtly. The primary students chosen for the film all are Christians (there are scenes of worship) and they are ultimately coached and sent to Christian institutions(Could also be because the institution offers scholarship because they are Christians, So not going to judge here).My problem is I appreciate good documentaries and it pisses me off when platforms like these are used to spread religion. If they do want to attract donors who are Christians then the filmmakers could have openly added it on the disclaimer instead of saying that this documentary does not side with any religion, which is just on contrary.The bottomline is Shanti Bhavan - 10, Christianity advert - 0."
tt1877895,"The Netflix series ""Daughters of Destiny"" deserves the lowest rating because it's a misuse of an education platform and yet another disrespectful example of conversion tactics. I don't know where they got their definition of ""caste system"" from but it's seriously misleading and also harmful to Hinduism. This is a decidedly anti-Hindu film which typically portrays Christians as ""saviors"" and makes Hinduism out to be ""the bad guy"" even though Hinduism has nothing to do with ""caste system"". In fact, the word ""caste"" does not exist in any sacred Hindu text and is not part of Hindi or Sanskrit language. What we recognize are ""Varna"" and ""Jaati"" which sees everyone as level players, equally valuable in the field of life. It is very hypocritical to see caste system attributed to Hindus when it is so prominent among white aristocracy, who rank people in order of importance. These invaders to India also perpetuated racial discrimination previously unheard of in Indian colonies. Naturally they saw their fair skin as superior. But how could an indigenous people who worship dark-hued Forms of God and who are often dark-hued themselves consider those with darker complexions to be inferior? No, this was unheard of before colonisation. But it has become tagged on to Hindus to this day and remains an issue because corrupt people still practice it. However, we must remember, it has nothing to do with Hinduism: This so-called ""documentary"" centres around the so-called magnanimity of the misleadingly-titled ""Shanti Bhavan"" school in south India founded by an Indian expat named Abraham George (go figure) with an underhanded aim of converting vulnerable groups to Christianity, though this motive is denied and underplayed throughout the series. Misinformation is spread about Hinduism and caste system is attributed to Hindus to create Hindumisia. Makers of this so-called ""documentary"" are self-serving in their aim to show down the Hindu religion as inferior to their foreign one. The filmmakers neglect the fact that caste system was introduced by the Portuguese as ""casta"" in 1500s and is NOT legally recognized by India's constitution. They also neglect the glaring fact that the PM of India Modi Himself as well as the President Herself come from so-called ""Dalit"" class, therefore there is no restriction on upward social movement among these groups. It is only human prejuduce and white lies (pun intended) that perpetuates caste system. I repeat, it has nothing to do with Hinduism and Shanti Bhavan school, far from being innocuous, remains an example of a deceptive missionary school funded by donations and run under the guise of charity/ non-profit, but whose aim is to convert the vulnerable but only the gullible will be fooled. Sensible people should realise that these self-serving wolves in sheep's clothing are definitely not ""saviors"" but exploiters whose aim is to help themselves get more followers by enticing them to leave their religion in 2 ways: spreading misinformation and creating a sense of debt/ loyalty for services rendered. Conversion is a despicable practice because it disrespects another person's religion or way of life without seeking to properly understand it. The founder of Shanti Bhavan is obviously one such person who was converted and is now on a mission to convert many others. Missionaries always operate under the guise of ""helping"". But in their quest to homogenize everyone, they are a threat to diversity and that is a real concern. On the same way that persons want their religion to be respected, they should respect others. In the same way that they would not want to be converted, they should not try to convert others. I would not recommend that anyone supports a school, film or project with conversion agenda. This is why I give this the lowest rating and encourage others to do the same. While you're at it, find out the truth about where caste came from, you will find it's not from Hinduism. It's so ironic that colonizers stole from Indians then used the funds to build schools to convert them. Furthermore, it's these white invaders that introduced caste and racial discrimination. But now Hindus must be grateful for those who caused the confusion in the first place? I'm so tired of the hypocrisy and so fed-up of seeing films like these using ""caste"" to promote their conversion agenda. I consider it a dangerous film because it's spreading misinformation and promoting hatred towards Hindus. This is unacceptable."
tt6385540,"I absolutley love everything about this show! The art is amazing and so creative, the imagination that went into the show entirely is amazing! I had originally put this show on for my little one and instead i got caught up watching the show like a zombie with him. (No cleaning was done haha) It really is fun for all ages! It also teaches children and whom ever is watching it about compassion and communication so you can pull something educational from every episode. And let's be honest the world can always use more of that! And It always has something new in every episode that keeps you hooked all the way thru the entire season! I hope they create a second season!!!!!"
tt6385540,The show is very lovely with beautiful art styles and has a sense of feeling like home when Hilda goes on those adventures you feel like your with her it is kiddish but something always interests you to watch more and I highly recommended completing the series and not only the art style but music like the theme song was really beautiful
tt6385540,"This show centers around the girl Hilda who lives in a phantastical world featuring all sorts of creatures. Hilda is a very likeable character from the start: she is very brave, kind and always looking for an adventure but she isn't perfect. There are also great side characters like her mother, her friends David and Frieda and a number of mythical creatures. The show proves to be very imaginative as it comes up with many quirky and pecuilar creatures, putting a new spin on familiar concepts.While the show centers around Hilda's adventure's it's also concerned with a lot of relatable themes like finding new friends, the question of what home is and family - which is represented by the heartwarming relationship between Hilda and her mother.What stands out is the fact that there is no simple division in good and evil, the world Hilda inhabits is much more complex. Creatures that appear to be evil at first glance usually turn out to be anything but and conflicts always have two sides. Hilda, though, always manages to solve the conflicts with communication and compromise, offering a very positive worldview.All in all it can be said that ""Hilda"" is a imaginative and intelligent show for both children and adult alike and I can only advise to watch it!"
tt6385540,"This feels so much like childhood. It a cozy fall evening near the fire. The colours and the artistic direction is stunning. In my childhood I used to read Calvin & Hobbes and Peanuts and it feels like going back to those small lighthearted adventures where you're immagnation is the limit. The creatures seem to be coming out of a child fantasy and they recall so much that part of me I always end up drowned in the atmosphere and wanting to come back to rewatch again the same adventure, for the simple feel of it, just like I'd always come back for the same old book of strips I had"
tt6385540,"This deserves all the praise. 30 seconds into the 1st episode, when that music hits with an amazing intro into the warm and cold mixture of calming colour tones to the not overly-simplified yet beautiful, sunday newspaper comic strip type art, unique and lovable characters...it's just perfect. The world she lives in, the people/things she meet, the plot...gotta give props to Luke Pearson for his books and Silvergate Media and Mercury Filmworks for making the pages come to life...this is such a treat. The interactions between Hilda and her mother makes it better. This is more towards kids but you'll find yourself smiling at what they have to offer to the child inside of you. Some say it's Gravity Falls reborn... this show has so much heart. Try it. You won't regret it ;)"
tt6385540,"One of the best shows ever. The world is amazing, the characters are fun and dynamic. Brings out the child in everyone"
tt6385540,"Ohhh my goodness! When i was browsing youtube one day, I came upon a Netflix commercial for this random show called Hilda. I thought to myself ""why not"" and clicked on the video. And let me tall you, that was a great decision. This new Netflix original is the best thing I have seen is months. It is a beautifully animated and coloured and no matter what your age, you should check it out. It might seem a bit boring to some people but if you liked Steven Universe or similar shows, chances are you will like this. Its a bit more catered to kids around the age of 7 to 11 but even I still find it amusing. I find they did an amazing job bringing this old comic back to life in animation form."
tt6385540,"Very good show, the animation is extremely well done, and the character designs are charming, the show is very light hearted but surprisingly so they manage to keep that tone while keeping the tension on the adventures, I felt the first episode was on the slow side, but I stuck to it and watched the whole thing, if you do too you will find out why its getting so many good reviews.It has something to teach about people and relationships but its not preachy about it, respecting the audience to draw their own conclusions. I think this is a great show for kids and adults alike, give it a shot, if you like well crafted character driven stories you wont be disappointed, Im looking forward to more seasons."
tt6385540,"Imagine what would happen if you combined the fantasy elements of Gravity Falls and Over the Garden Wall, and mix them in with both the practical humor of Calvin and Hobbes and the family and friend bonds of Laika's best works. You'd get a simple albeit engaging graphic novel turned cartoon series like Hilda. It's always good to stream new content on Netflix, because then you discover adorably wholesome gems like this.Set in a world consisting of people and fantasy creatures, the series centers around a kindhearted and adventurous little girl named Hilda, who has lived most of her life in the wilderness, along with her mom Johanna and pet deerfox Twig. Upon moving to the city of Trolberg, she befriends two kids named Frida and David. With that said, a lot of the episodes center around the trio working out a situation regarding their scout activities, and this is where Hilda shines as the show's true star. She always knows the procedure whenever a creature like a giant, troll and even a raven is afloat due to her upbringing, but that does lead to her either screwing up or learning something different each time. It's always neat when children learn something new every day on top of what they already know.In addition, the other characters all have their own pros and cons that work well with each other. Frida is a highly determined scout always trying to earn badges, but she tends to get too caught up in them and hates to face her own flaws. David can be easily frightened and anxious, but always tries to overcome his worries with the help of his friends. The relationship between the kids really feels genuine, as even when they disagree or even argue, they still work well with each other on their adventures and even develop based on what one thinks of the other. As for the rest, Johanna never minds the surreal creatures Hilda is around, but only when it depends on what Hilda is up to. As she wants what's best for both Hilda and her, the series' heart tends to bloom with their adorable mother-daughter bonding.The last thing to really talk about is the wonderful animation, as the soothing color scheme helps paint the down-to-Earth feel of both the wilderness and Trolberg in a comforting aesthetic. If one is to recreate a setting with forests, city architecture and other wilderness features, they should definitely create it to resemble the real world, and this show does just that. Not to mention, the characters are designed in a simplistic cartoony style, which makes them look very appealing, even the more macabre ones. I know people get sick of cartoons that resemble the Cal Arts style, but this show presents itself as a breath of fresh air given how monotone the visuals are.Needless to say, Hilda is a wonderful animated series that captures the innocence of childhood adventure through brisk story telling, relatable and endearing characters, and gorgeous animation. Whether you're a child or an adult, I definitely recommend giving this show a watch. It's one of the few cartoons nowadays that is able to invite its audience to join in the mystery on finding new characters and their curiously strange habits. I think if we can take away anything from this show, it's that like Hilda, we shouldn't put aide our childlike fun just because we are to grow up soon."
tt6385540,"This lovely animated series, with its grace and magical realism, reminds me of the works of the great Hayao Miyazaki. It's aimed at children, but adults can enjoy it as well - I certainly did.Hilda (Bella Ramsey, also known as Game of Thrones' young Lyanna Mormont) is a spirited little girl inhabiting a world where mundane and supernatural coexist, so cities have walls to keep trolls out, magic birds fly over the town festival and ghosts can either haunt your sleep with nightmares or help you clean up your room.Hilda and her mother (Daisy Haggard) move from their cabin in a wilderness where Elves and Giants roam to the city of Trolberg. The initially unhappy Hilda starts to enjoy the change and meets new friends, both other kids and magical creatures who manage to slip inside the apparently normal urban life.Like its storytelling, the series' aesthetic is effective and deceptively simple, with minimalistic character design reminiscent of classics like Calvin & Hobbes and Peanuts, smooth animations and a color palette steeped in shades of oranges, browns and blues. It's a testament to the power of animation; this enchanting series would have been a garish mess if told in a CGI-heavy live-action version. Voice acting and music are perfect.Recommended age: 6+. The tone is whimsical, lighthearted; magical creatures are mostly cute or comedic, like the rules-obsessed Elf or the supercilious Wood Man. However, a few more intense episodes may scare younger kids - I'm thinking Chapters 6 and 8, which are a notch creepier than the others.After a successful first season with 13 episodes, Netflix has renewed Hilda for a second season.9/10"
tt6385540,I thought this show was pretty adorable. It has some interesting and unique writing and artwork. The voice acting is a bit flat but otherwise the show is well done.
tt6385540,"This charmingly animated series is a delightful tale of childhood adventure. Hilda freshly moved to the city from her magical creature-infested forest home, navigates both supernatural pests and mundane social interactions with her school-mates. Hilda is attended by her elf-friend, Alfur, and a small deer fox, Twig, as well as human companions Frida and David, all of whom lend constructive perspectives on the events while playing an assigned archetype role. While formulaic, as most children's shows will be, the episodes capture a whimsical air of adventure and discovery, as Hilda continues to defy social expectations and dispel prejudices against the magical creatures she is ever so fond of. An outstanding detail to me, among the minutia of a well-orchestrated animated TV short, is the character integrity. Each character maintains flaws and principals in an entirely enjoyable and realistic manner. While still learning from mistakes, core traits are not switched at the drop of a hat, as often happens to antagonists in oversimplified children shows. Hilda is produced by Silvergate Media, a company known for successful children shows such as Octonauts (2010-present) and Peter Rabbit (2012-2016) and as such it is little surprise that the show has such simple elegance."
tt6385540,It was an incredible show to watch. I mean I can't believe they could put so much reality in this show. I hope they come out with more chapters. And this reminded me so much of a graphic novel
tt6385540,"Coming from a huge animation fan. This show could not click. It felt like a formula that is traditional but Netflix didn't commit enough. They said ""Ya know let's make a series that makes $$$ and then dump it!"""
tt6385540,"Hilda is a show I did not expect to love as much as I do. What could've been passed off as a decent show for children turned out to be a fantastic show for all ages. With an amazing cast of characters, creative world building and strong writing, this show stands toe to toe with the likes of Steven Universe as one of the best cartoons from the 2010s.Based on the book series by Luke Pearson, the show follows the adventures of the titular blue haired girl, Hilda, alongside her deerfox companion Twig, her friends David and Frida, her elf scribe Alfur and her mother Johanna. Set in the quaint city of Trollberg, each episode of the show finds Hilda exploring the wilderness around the city and discovering fantastical new creatures. In addition to that she learns valuable lessons about actions and consequences, being a good friend and being responsible. The show wisely incorporates genuine stakes in each episode as well as a good amount of humor and a sense of wonder to this world so as to prevent dragging. The show also takes the time to add character to not just the fantastical creatures, but also the people of Trollberg.Transitioning to the characters, just about every single one of the main cast is well developed, has a strong personality and have excellent chemistry with one another. Starting with our leading lady, Hilda is very much the epitome of an adventurous tomboy with a heart of gold. She's brave, curious, cautious and optimistic, making her a well rounded character audiences can relate to. Her deerfox companion Twig is brave like Hilda but also very loyal and friendly. Plus, he's just got an adorable design that makes me wish he was real. Hilda's Mom, Johanna is a very well written portrayal of a single mother. She's caring, she's helpful, she worries for Hilda and she's also resourceful when the moment calls for it. Alfur is a smart, honest little elf that comes up with genius plans to save the day and his fascination with all of Trollberg is always a treat. David and Frida are two haves of the same coin. David may be fearful and Frida's alot more brave but one thing they have in common is that they couldn't wish for a better friend than Hilda. Hilda actually helps David learn to overcome his fears and her and Frida may have their differences but very much remain good friends. Other notable characters that appear in the show include the librarian, the Wood Man, The Great Raven and the lost elf clan.In addition to great characters, this show has a very talented voice cast behind it. Bella Ramsey plays Hilda beautifully and makes her sound like a real little girl with a heart of gold. Daisy Haggard gives a very good performance as Johanna, making her sound like a real caring Mom to a very adventurous girl. Ameerah Falzon-Ojo and Oliver Nelson fit the roles of Frida and David perfectly, with Ilan Galkoff providing a beautiful singing voice to David. Thomas & Friends fans will be happy to recognize Rasmus Hardiker as the voice of Alfur as he gives him such a cute and friendly voice that matches his personality.Visually, the show looks stupendous. Mercury Filmworks and Atomic Cartoons provided the animation for the show and it looks amazing. The color palette has a nice autumn feel to it, the animation feels so smooth and natural and the designs of the characters are all unique fit with their personalities. I especially love the designs of the fantastical creatures and how no two creatures are alike. I once again have to bring up that Twigs design is so adorable. When he sleeps he curls up into a ball with his long tail wrapped around and it's just so cute.Hilda is without a doubt one of Netflix's best cartoons and it's not hard to see why. It's got a great cast of characters, amazing animation, stellar voice work, and strong, clever writing. Really the only gripe I have is in Season 2, the head of safety patrol Erik Alhberg is just an arrogant town's hero who only cares about the glory. Thankfully the rest of the cast is so great I'm willing to let it slide. If you haven't seen Hilda yet, I highly recommend giving it a watch. I guarantee you'll want to explore this world too as much as Hilda."
tt6385540,"I had such fears that s3 wasn't going to be what I wanted, that it wasn't going to deliver something... good? That it was going to be a let down in some way - because it feels like so much media is these days.Hilda feels like such a heart show. It's filled with all the warmth you could conceivably want, nestled in the joyous valley somewhere between The Hobbit, Anne With an E, and Over the Garden Wall.It's intelligent, and flush with life. It's where I want to be. I feel like Hilda is the kind of person I want to be, or the friend I wanted when I was younger, or some reflection of a neurological self - I don't know. But it makes me feel like I have friends when I feel lonely, and it makes meant to breathe forest air and make art. And that's good art."
tt6385540,"From the moment I first saw the trailer I knew this was going to be a show unlike any other. Watching it was one of the best decisions I ever made. From episode 1 all the way to episode 13, Hilda kept me hooked and wanting to see more. From amazing and lovable characters, smooth and breathtaking animation, a cast and crew that really brings the show to life and a feeling of nostalgia that you just cannot begin to comprehend. A lot of people are saying Hilda has many similarities to Gravity Falls and Over the Garden Wall. I don't. The show is first off based on Luke Pearson's Hildafolk comics that have been out since 2010, well before GF and OTGW ever aired. The shows are all original in their own way and I feel people need to watch shows without comparing them to others. It makes the viewing experience better and more enjoyable. Hilda is amazing in its own way. In some ways it did things better then Gravity Falls and OTGW did. I could go on about how amazing Hilda is but quite frankly, watching it for yourself and making your own decision on how good it is, is better then reading reviews from random people online. And be sure to read the original Hilda books as well. Luke Pearson's world will suck you in make you smile. Such is the life of an adventurer."
tt6385540,"""Hilda"" is a British-made series about a strange little girl who lives in Scandinavia...and it's now being brought to the States by Netflix. It's a most unusual show...one that apparently has been approved for a second season and that is good news.
The story begins in the countryside. Hilda is a neat little girl who has the uncanny ability to interact with supposedly mythical creatures...such as trolls and elves. In addition, seeing these creatures doesn't seem to scare her in the least...even when the trolls are mountain size! After two episodes, however, she and her mother are forced to move to the city...and there she makes friends with two kids who become her comrads in her adventures.To understand this cartoon, it's a bit like combining ""The X-Files"" with ""Gravity Falls""...but still quite cute and unique. The show is also great for anyone who loves mythology...and my daughter REALLY loves that sort of thing and insisted we watch all 13 episodes in one sitting! Overall, quite fun and a truly unusual sort of cartoon that will keep you wanting more."
tt6385540,"My 8-year-old daughter was a fan of the graphic novels--not a huge fan, but she read all of them. She was not really interested in this show for some reason. But my 6-year old son loved it, and watched it while his sister was at gymnastics. It has its share of suspense and fearful creatures, but on the whole manages to be almost slow paced, but in a positive way, which fits well with the slow unrolling of the mysteries of the woods, and the new city to which Hilda has moved with her mom."
tt6385540,It such a nice cartoon. The violence it kept to a minimum..... I love the voice actors ( especially the voices of Hilda and Alpha).....It a nice cartoon for all ages and I hope it will continue with more interesting stories.
tt6385540,"This. Show. Is. AMAZING! The visuals are just, wow! The story: intresting, mysterious, and charming. As an animator myself, I only dream the fluid-ness of the animation. Everyone who worked on this show is AMAZING! If you have netflix, this is a bingeable-must-watch show!"
tt6385540,"This cartoon is meant for children but I (29 yr) love it too, and so do a couple of my friends.The reason being that this show is so well constructed. There are so many little visual jokes, nice details, and recurring characters that it makes the show feel very enjoyable. The art style is original and great, especially the colour palet. This combined with a great soundtrack makes it visually very pleasing.And the stories are just as good. I especially like how almost any character we meet will show up again in a different episode, instead of focusing on only the main character.So all in all I'm very impressed and hope to see more of this show!"
tt6385540,"Hilda brings out the best out of kids entertainment, and it pushes the boundaries as to just how meaningful and flat out amazing animation can be. This is a show for all ages, but especially show it to kids around the age of 8, they will remember it for years to come and it may just be a classic for them when they grow up. 
In a world full of bad things happening constantly, and even worse kids entertainment (i.e. the recent Netflix animated film 'Next Gen'), Hilda is exactly the type of show that might just teach kids a positive thing or two."
tt6385540,My kids and i (6 year old boy & 11 year old girl) absolutely loved Hilda. I wonderfully animated programme with really heart working stories. Lots of laughter with some get characters and a lesson behind each episode.Just watch it!!
tt6385540,"Yes it's for kids but the world building, the voice acting, the lore, the stories, they're all absolutely 10/10 perfection.There is one episode, about the Deerfoxes, taken in context,.it'll move you to absolute tears. It's so beautifully crafted and well made and moving. It would hold it up against the best episodes of any TV show, including grown up TV shows."
tt9335498,"I hope that kimetsu no yaiba is a recurring anime and not only lasts for the confirmed 26 episodes. The story and animation are absolutely breathtaking. Very keen to see how it progresses throughout. so far, a really awesome anime."
tt9335498,"I'm calling for it this show is going to be amazing and for the last 2 episodes have already got me because the animation is just breathtaking and very crisp too. And the storytelling is gotta be good as ""Dororo"". And the studio is from Ufotable, The one that made the Fate series no wonder the animation is so good."
tt9335498,Randomly saw this anime and clicked on it wasn't even paying attention to it and then it just got me hooked from the get go like literally from the very start I've been glued to it.Hero academia and demon slayer(kimetsu no yaiba) are my favourites of all time
tt9335498,"I love this anime, by reading the manga and comparing the episodes I'm just blown away, the action scenes are so impressive, as well the pace, I'm usually upset when there's a lot of missing stuffs from the mangas, but not this one, so far its been great."
tt9335498,"This show has been given justice, this is a anime that has outdone the manga. Tanjiro our protaganist is unlike many other shonen anime protaganists (one piece: Luffy for example) while Luffy's goal is to become the pirate king, tanjiros goal does not base itself in his growth. It is his will and moral of saving others and furfilling his quest of helping his sister that drives him forward which means that gaining strengh is not the primarily focus which for me adds a new perspective to the show. If you have seen up until episode 19 and you have not rated this show, There really is no convincing you. This show is a masterpiece and you'll be hooked from the first episode!"
tt9335498,What an anime! Most often times a soundtrack tells how good an anime will be and from the first few scenes I knew I was onto something here. The story and emotions that run through this show is just breathtaking. Anime's are rarely made like this anymore. So glad I found it.
tt9335498,"Great animation, interesting story, and a lot of brutal scenes later on. Def. Not a slow start but it kinda eases itself into the story and gradually gets better. Really liking the show"
tt9335498,"I like this anime soo much. It have good story, lovable character, beautiful art style. And it even have Michael Jackson in díguise."
tt9335498,This anime is awesome. The characters are amazing and the storylines are engaging. This is easily one of the best anime's of all time!
tt9335498,"Visuals 9/10 but writing? 4/10, there is almost no character development... From start to end of the 1st test its been promising, and I enjoyed the show that far a lot,,, since Inosuke joins the ""plot"" it goes down, this character ruined the whole show for me, not funny, just plain annoying, he had no purpose at all in the show... Still good anime, just not as good as it's advertised"
tt9335498,"The story of demon slayer is pretty simple. Tanjiro is the main character, his familiy gets killed by a demon only his sister survived. Now he is becoming a demon slayer to hunt the demon who murdered his family. For that he'll be part of an organization, called demon slayer corps, which a ranking system going from 1 to 10. On this journey he meet two other young demon slayer, which then accompaing him on his quest.Well, reading that you might see many pretty generic plotlines. Of course, that must not be bad per se. But the thing here is, that the characters are quite flat. Our young hero Tanjiro for example is really nice and friendly, thats it. He has no flaws, no errors. He has a tragic backstory, cries sometimes and must train more to become stronger... wow, never heard that before. Same goes for all the other characters and also for the world. Like the ranking system for the organization, it was just once mentioned. During the first season we only get to know members from the highest rank. What about all the other ranks? ( It would be like in One Piece during the first 100 episode we will only meet yonkos ). And to the style of the main characters: The main characters look so much out of place with the hair and the styling, compared to other people. And nobody is paying attention to that (not like in FMA were everybody is constantly looking at them)
What really is amazing about the tv show is the animation and beautiful drawing. It is really top, watching the episode 19 season 1 was really amazing. Also the music is quite good. (But honestly, music and animation not as good as AOT - lets be real here).The tv show is okay to watch, it can be funny and interesting. Maybe younger audiences will love it more. For me it is quite predictable and generic.Is it a masterpiece like so many keep saying? No, not for me."
tt9335498,"I'm an attack on titan fan and even I have to admit that it's a really good show...the animation from ufotable is just absolutely brilliant and beats most anime and all animated shows around the planet. I admit, the storyline of demon slayer isn't anything new, some people say it's an overrated show, some say it's cliche...and that's ok...why???...because every single person is entitled to their own opinion...the criticisms might be true but I will say this...there's a reason why this anime is so popular and there's a reason why so many people not only in Japan but around the world enjoy it. Not every single anime or TV show has to have a plot twist of a story like attack on titan or Vinland saga, as long as its entertaining and enjoyable for everyone to enjoy then really thats all that matters. Demon slayer is a good show and I would highly recommend it to anyone especially people who aren't anime watchers, it's incredible."
tt9335498,"I think it's one of the best animes of the season, the animation it's refreshing, totally recommended"
tt9335498,Emotional and beautiful. Very little fan service compared to other animes. The main character is wholesome and a joy to see grow as a person and see his interactions with others!
tt9335498,"Being new to this Anime genre, I am amazed by the artwork, uniqueness of characters & fantastic world. Of course my favourite is Tanjiro - just pure good soul in dark world. Awesomeness."
tt9335498,"Absolutely undeniably amazing anime, defo top 5 anime of all time. Fight scenes so far are excellent and the story is already so enthralling. Can't wait for the upcoming episodes and future seasons... and 100% a movie."
tt9335498,"There's not much to talk about, the anime is wonderful, you're crying, having fun and going crazy. Waiting for the next episode.The anime, in addition to being very well directed, has a sensational graphic. The fights are great at reducing. And you end up following the saga without blink."
tt9335498,"Really dont know what to say. I am blown away by this Anime. I began to watch it without any expectations and than Booooom!!! Its amazing, watch it and you'll be convinced too."
tt9335498,"Holy.... AESTHETIC AF.... colorways are beautiful..one of my top 10 animes ... love the graphics/ost ... content gets better with each episode with a cliff hanger every episode ...This is the first manga I read after watching the first 18 episodes, because I wanted to know what happened after all these cliff hangers hahaa"
tt9335498,"Well executed, but the only thing that differentiates it from a million other battle anime's is the artstyle. Characters have chemistry, but can get extremely annoying at times and most are very one dimensional."
tt9335498,"This anime is overrated imo. The animation is definitely top-notched, no doubt about it. But here are where the faults lie:1. Mis-matched music. They need to do better with music editing. Some battles' epicness is taken away by the un-epicness of the background music.
2. Too much internalization. I know internalization is part and parcel of animes but goddamn the main character just won't shut up for a second.
3. Above all, the anime has a mediocre and typical storyline. The main character sets out on a quest to find the cure for his sister. To this end he must fight demons, which is basically like every other shounen anime ever. That's it. There's nothing else to the story. No depth. No complexity. To make up for the lackluster storyline, the author just includes some fanservicing scenes with cute adorable characters. If you're just looking for well-animated fighting sequences, this is the anime for you. If you are looking for animes that raise philosophical questions to make you ponder for days and days, look elsewhere."
tt9335498,"Really i think this anime doesn't have a bad episode, everyone has such a whole soundtracks and things eles , I like it!."
tt9335498,One of the best original animes I've seen. Will gladly reccomend to my friends and coworkers.
tt9335498,"This is a masterpiece built in tragedy and the love of family. A brother comes home only to find his family slain by a demon. The sister survives and is tùrned to a demon as well. It is a journey of the brother to find a cure and defend his sister.It is full of sorrow and grief, friendship and also the love of family.I guarentee you will love it.If you are new to anime, this is the best way to get you addicted."
tt9103932,"I stumbled across this late on a Friday night. The last war documentary that I'd seen was Peter Jackson's ""They Shall Not Grow Old"" and I had been yearning for a similar experience ever since. Well, safe to say-- I found it. This is an enthralling watch. The colorization of such massively historical events allows us viewers 70+ years later to empathize in an unimaginable way, and is careful enough to give us fresh insight into perspectives from both sides. Well done to all involved. Netflix in my opinion is hit or miss but this is without a doubt as good as it gets. Top class. A real tribute to the heroic men and women of that generation.Side note: Pay no heed to the so-called political connotations suggested by other reviewers. Having watched the entire series through, my mind never once went there, I was too enraptured by the images and the quality on display. It in no way detracts from the documentary itself, if you're reading this prior to watching don't let such comments dismay you. I couldn't recommend this film highly enough."
tt9103932,"If you're someone who'd like to better understand WWII in a thoughtful, comprehensive, well-paced film... this is it.And here are 3 reasons why:It is totally captivating. I've seen countless films on WWII, but this moves with a pace that allows you to absorb the key events while gaining insight on why things happened the way they did. Although I've seen so many accounts of the war, this summarized it better than any other film in my opinion.It's binge-worthy. I stayed up all night long watching this - much more engaging than the typical war documentaries that put us all to sleep. I will watch it again with my wife and I know she will like it because you're compelled to watch the next episode.It's relevant. The approach they've taken - beautifully restored and colorized film combined with thoughtful accounts by historians and veterans - is to be commended and treasured. But more importantly, it reminds us of what people with bad ideas can accomplish when the rest of us stay silent. A timeless and painful lesson."
tt9103932,"Its so sad listening to so many butthurt complainers nitpicking at everything in this documentary. Honestly you could make a 30 or 40 part documentary series on ww2 and not even scratch the surface of the entire war and do every aspect and every service person justice. Those who complain that their country isn't mentioned... so what. You can't mention every damn country in detail.I think this documentary series does a splendid job as acting as an introductory series to perhaps children/teenagers learning about ww2 for the first time. (then move on to books) Personally I knew most of the information but I enjoyed hearing it again with some coloured footage. The narrator is really easy to listen to and his commentary is mixed in with some war authors and some vetrans (who are becoming very very few, so these documentations of their experiences are essential)"
tt9103932,"This series main selling point, according to Netflix is ""rare footage from around the world, expertly restored in full color, tells the story as you've never seen it before.""It's true. I've never seen it told with such inaccuracy.From a purely narrated standpoint, it's not a totally bad documentary. It omits a TON, but makes up for it somewhat by revealing little known details and recollections from people who lived it.My main beef with this series is that their main selling point is bs. The Dunkirk episode supposedly depicts Ju-87 Stuka dive bombers attempting to pick off English boats and ships in the channel supporting the British Expeditionary Force's evacuation of France. But the footage is not of Stukas, but some other aircraft I had some trouble recognizing. In the Battle of Britain, the Spitfire is mentioned frequently, but the footage is of Hawker Hurricanes, which was already considered obsolete by Spitfire standards by the Summer of 1940. However, the big aerial fight scenes depicting German He-111 medium range bombers and Bf-109E fighters engaging Spitfires over London, are actually re-enactments from the 1969 historical drama ""Battle of Britain."" The Bf-109Es were not actual Messerschmitts, even, but Spanish HA-1112 Buchons built after the war in the 1950s, that existed in flying condition in greater numbers than actual Messerschmitts, many of which were destroyed by the Allied and Soviet forces as they closed in on Berlin.Often, substitute footage is used when authentic footage is unavailable or scarce. I get it though. The layman won't be able to tell the difference. What I didn't like so much was that Netflix is peddling this as ""rare footage ... expertly restored in full color"" -- which leads you to believe all of it, at the very least, is from the era in question, and it's been colorized to give a more accurate depiction of the war.The final straw for me was a scene during the Pearl Harbor episode, which supposedly depicted Japanese dive bombers attacking Pearl Harbor, with the big red sun emblazoned on their fuselages. But this footage is actually of a US Navy dive bomber called the SBD Dauntless, its stars and bars ""photoshopped out"" and replaced with the rising sun of Japan. What the hell, Netflix? Top Gun did something similar, by reimagining the USAF F-5 Tiger as the fictious Mig-28, but I doubt any of us went into that theater thinking that this was anything more than RAD on steroids.If you want to watch a really good documentary on WW2, Ken Burns's ""The War"" is a great choice. Also, the History Channel ran a terrific series called the ""War Room"" -- and instead of taking liberties with scarce historical footage, they supplemented their narrative with really neat graphic animations that talked about the tactics and strategies that either lost or won the battles. This Netflix series is a bit of clickbait, and a little bait and switch. There are so many better sources to learn about WW2."
tt9103932,"Though I've studied WWII for much of my life, I found this series to be a good, concise description of key events. While it does not go into great depth, it still manages to pack in enough detail with empathetic insights from both Axis and Allied viewpoints. It's an excellent refresher or starting point for key events, which will hopefully engage the viewer to research further.My only qualm was that the series ends abruptly, with no conclusion/summary. I'd be interested to see a 2nd season into the Cold War, as is hinted at the end of Ep.10."
tt9103932,"From the beginning I was hooked. The way the show details the events, the strategies, the beautiful footage, interviews, etc was gripping and I binge watched the show over 2 days. It goes into the psychology of the most important people and what led to their decisions. It takes into account the culture of the individual countries at the time and is filled with suspense and twists. It was also very informative, I knew a little bit about WWII from high school classes, but this really helped fill in the gaps in a satisfying way. I feel like I've learned more than in the 2 days of watching this show than I would in a year of study. If you are slightly interested in the events of WWII and want a dramatic narrative of the most important events, this show is for you!"
tt9103932,"Honestly, the footage in the first two episodes of this documentary is NOT why you should be watching this series.This series is English, and the narrator and script is first rate. The war historians and professors are also top notch. Add to that a few surviving veterans and some truly solid human interest stories about the top leaders, generals, on down to the soldiers and pilots, and it's a surprisingly emotional and beautifully produced documentary series.This isn't as sterile and rote as many WWII documentaries, and it's certainly more about people than the title would have you believe. I almost didn't watch it because of the title, and to be honest, there is footage in here from films, modern re-enactments, and some colorized B&W as well. There is a majority amount of authentic color footage as well, much of it I've never seen before.The documentary also seems to delve into the true motivations and machinations of various real events in WWII, and the invasion of France in particular included a lot of information which was new to me. I consider myself knowledgeable, but certainly not a scholar, but it was interesting to hear various facts and theories related by scholars I had not considered before.The second episode is dedicated to a real veteran pilot of the Battle Of Britain who was interviewed for the episode. You really got the sense of heroism and duty from this clearly very aged but lucid survivor. The editing is fast paced but really easy to absorb.Honestly, this was far better than I expected. This is up there with the much older World at War series that Olivier narrated, though it's hard to beat Olivier for gravitas. Still, this really is worth seeing for any history buff and good for newbies as well. To those discussing omissions, of course that is going to happen in such a hugely broad topic.What also comes across quickly in this series, more so than in other series I've seen, is the unnecessary futility and outright stupidity of Hitler's goals and ambitions, and the tragic waste of the entire war. Whatever savvy innovations the Germans proved they had in the first 9 months of the war was clearly being squandered from Dunkirk on. The first episode also does gives the best explanation I've ever heard of explaining how and why the French folded."
tt9103932,"Whilst there are no startling revelations within this series, as the WW2 conflict has been covered by countless other documentaries, the colouring of the footage does bring the subject matter home in a far more relatable manner.In fact some of the colouring is so good, you feel like you're watching something that could have been filmed in the last decade.A must see for any modern history enthusiasts!"
tt9103932,"I've read a few reviews where people have been dissappointed that parts of WW2 have been missed. However, this show is about the 'greatest events' and is not intended to be a chronology. Fantastic footage which I really enjoyed."
tt9103932,Missing so much details and trying to focus on special events only and focusing as much as they can on very few events . May be trying to make us see something which I didnt understand because they negelected great events in WW2 with no reason
tt9103932,"I love WW2 documentaries. However, the lack of respect shown to the diggers got to me.
Australia entered world war 2 well before the USA.
No mention of rats of Tobruk or Kokoda just to name a couple.Overall the series had a great amount of knowledgeable information and footage."
tt9103932,It's a great docuseries! Other reviews may try to pull in their own political agenda into it but just watch it and hear the facts and form your own opinion 10/10
tt9103932,"First, in defense of the series against some of the review comments about the source of the video, just because you've seen it in a movie doesn't mean it's not real wartime footage. Older movies, before CGI, did that all the time to save money. For instance, we've all seen that crash of the plane onto the carrier deck in a movie or two, the one where it breaks in half and spins around. But it's real, not shot for a movie.
Second, there's no way to cover everything important that occurred in WWII in 10 hours so obviously many important things will be left out. You can't cover the contributions of every country when so many participated so you pick the major combatants, etc.
My main complaint is in many cases they cover some subjects in such a way as to focus on a more minor topic and leave out the major one. So many examples I can't list them all but here's just one: in the Battle of Britain episode they extensively cover the Spitfire without even a mention of the Hawker Hurricane when in fact there were many more Hurricanes used and Hurricanes were responsible for many more German losses than Spitfires. Yes, the Spitfire was the shiney new plane at the the time. But it's higher complexity meant lower percent availability of the smaller numbers of planes and the Hurricane's quicker turnaround time meant a single Hurricane could fly more sorties in a day. So why not take even 20 seconds to mention the most important British fighter in the Battle, especially the early stages?"
tt9103932,"1. It is an interesting documentary to watch but sacrifices clearness of information for a more interesting presentation. E..G. The Battle of Midway starts by mentioning the cryptographer suspecting Midway will be attacked but is not believed. Then after the documentary starts narrating events, it goes back to explain how the cryptographer found someone to believe him and how they positively determined the target was Midway.2. Worse is the typical war documentary put together by uninformed producers looking for nice videos. They often include video of something completely unrelated to the present narrative--probably guessing the viewer doesn't know any more about the subject than they do. Unfortunately that leads to confusing material and the lack of credibility in the whole message. E.G. During the Battle of Midway, the narrative is discussing the B-17 (heavy 4-engine bomber) attack, but shows video of C-47 (two-engine transports) and some other mid-size two-engine bomber that clearly did not participate in this battle. Another example is including video of Japanese two-engine mid-bombers during the Pearl Harbor attack--only single engine aircraft were launched by the Japanese in this attack."
tt9103932,This production is incredibly well done. The footage they have restored is simply phenomenal to watch. The story telling and narrator are fantastic. Well done.
tt9103932,"It's a really well made, well documented and well put together series. It's beautiful to watch all that history in colour and so well explained. For someone that like WW2 stories, like me, the show is amazing, there was so much details that I didn't know that happened and I was very impressed. Very well done to Netflix and all the people that put this documentary together."
tt9103932,"All history teachers should be sent to re-education camps and taught how to tell the truth of wars. For instance, the use of drugs by the Nazi soldiers. I had no idea of that ever happening but after seeing the film I can understand it. Overall, even though I've seen most of this in one place or the other, it was absolutely the best WWII documentary I've seen. Don't think I'll ever have to watch another. Thank you Netflix. You are at your best with this."
tt9103932,"The episodes are truly expertly made, especially when it comes to specific events (which are the main topic of most episodes).Naturally, a lot of information is missing, especially when it comes to the background about many many leaders as well as Nazi officers, and many more people who are integral for understanding the second world war. Viewing the TV show as mostly ""battle. (i.e as a show focusing on explaining in detail the battles of the WW themselves rather than the motives behind them and the background that led to them) - I am very much fine with giving up these important details, especially considering the short show's length.I would like to talk extensively about the problems I've had with the 9th episode, talking about the Holocaust. The entire episode is pretty poorly made, you can't try to explain the holocaust well enough in just under 50 minutes, it's just not enough. It'd be fine if the show didn't even make a single episode about the horrors of the holocaust, as I said, it's not the main purpose of the show. But if you are going to talk about the holocaust then you better do it well and 50 minutes just isn't enough, it is clearly noticeable in that episode that they just tried to cram far too much information in such a short time, and so many important details about the holocaust were left missing as a result.Lastly, the position of the show feels morally wrong to me, trying to justify the allies' decision not to take action knowing the atrocities the jews went through. They obviously knew of the holocaust (though not to the extent of it perhaps) and they could have tried to at least offer refuge to jews (which as was explained, just wasn't the case) and do much more than that. The allies stood and did nothing about the holocaust because antisemitism existed in the entire world, and frankly no one gave a damn about the jews. The entire existence of Israel as a state is strongly believed to be a result of the blame counties felt for looking away from the holocaust in WW2 and voting in favor of founding Israel in resolution 181 of the UN. The allies' fault is nothing compared to cruelty of the Nazis, but standing aside and letting those horrors happen are also unforgivable."
tt9103932,"Very good quality, learnt a few things I did not know. Does not cover all aspects of WWII. Seems objective."
tt9103932,"Before watching this, I had limited information regarding WW2. Now, I can list major events of WW2."
tt9103932,"This is a good overview of some of the major points in the war.The footage used is good and the colorization of the films is well done. Not too much and it's hard to notice that it's from black and white originally.Episode 10 on Buchenwald is, however, a stinker. The experts they use are biased and do not make fair or accurate comparisons. It destroys their credibility and, disappointingly, taints the entire project."
tt9103932,I am enthralled by world war 2 documentaries and the stories behind them. I was looking to watch this to see an objective narrative that covered the whole world war 2.I feel like the world war's effect on Asia was very much left aside. Japan's crime against south east asia was usually brushed over and maybe just to one episode. Australia was totally ignored. India's involvement with British troops was ignored.The narrative could have been extended longer to a few fascinating seasons to the war in Europe. The Pacific war. The involvement of countries. Etc.Oh and let me just say that some of the experts were obviously taking sides and it sounded very disturbing to say the least.
tt9103932,"It's quite incredible to see what kind of nonsense this series feeds to the audience. If you look at the map of Europe presented in this series (e.g. the one depicted in the first episode when presenting German territorial losses after the treaty of Versailles), especially looking at Poland, you will see borders that have never been a reality. It's a combination of the present and past borders with a fake East Prussia region put ontop of the current Polish borders. It is ridiculous to see this series not being able to get such simple facts straight."
tt11904786,"Love on the Spectrum is what reality TV should be--a way to share what reality is for people experiencing life in a different way. Of course, it is edited, but the creators did a great job balancing the triumphs and heartbreaks and showing us all the little steps along the paths to love that the participants are taking. Very glad to hear there will be another season--each person interviewed shows us a different world view."
tt11904786,"If you need something to remind you that there is still good in this world, this is the show to watch. At the end I just wanted to hug each and every one of them."
tt11904786,"This 4 part documentary is unexpectedly charming. Each person has a unique story and a completely different way of navigating through dating while being on the spectrum.
I laughed, cried, cringed, applauded, and screamed at the tv. It will give you all the feels! Definitely worth the watch.
""Whenever a person is feeling bored or unhappy in their relationship with someone, all they need to do is stop and do one thing that everyone should do: smell the flowers. They don't bloom everyday"" - Michael"
tt11904786,"Being on the spectrum and looking for love seems almost identical to not being on the spectrum and looking for love. The main difference seems to be that some people with ASD are more aware of all the challenges you must face when going on dates and therefore prepare more for them. We can all learn something from this.That's why this series is so moving. You recognize yourself in every situation. The nervousness and awkwardness you feel when you meet someone for the first time; the rules and rituals that make the dates feel a bit strange and unnatural; the difficult task of reading the other person's signals and sorting out your own feelings - we've all been there.I laughed, cried, cringed, and went aaaww many times while watching this. The people in this series are incredibly brave. It's a privilege to be allowed to follow them in their pursuit of a life partner. They inspire me to face my own fears with more courage.This is a wonderful series that I'd recommend to anyone."
tt11904786,"I loved this show. I am on episode 3 right now, but so far I'm really enjoying it. It shows the realism of dating on the spectrum, and if you're neurotypical this gives you a whole different point of view. There were funny moments, cringey moments, and happy moments and I just love the emotion in this show. It shows what dating is, sometimes it's imperfect but it takes a while to hit a gold mine. I hope they make more shows like this, well done."
tt11904786,This is just a really heartwarming series. It felt like the makers really wanted to help the people participating. Really loved it and shows how unique people on the autism spectrum can be!
tt11904786,"Just do yourself a favor and watch this show!
A wonderful and heartwarming show that we can all learn from!
Very happy to know that they are doing season 2, i cannot wait!
Congratulations to all cast and crew who made this show happen"
tt11904786,"Better than a 10 to me, I almost wasn't sure if I'd enjoy this series so much! I have Asperger's syndrome disorder I like to use all the variations of it. Such a great documentary show about people on the spectrum; so glad this was recommended to me a few times. I love everything about this unique gem! So heartwarming, inspirational, perfectly awkward, and well made! I've barely had relationships, mostly weird ones and never a proper one with common interests maybe one day."
tt11904786,"As a mom of 3year old on the spectrum, with my husband who's also on the spectrum, I would definitely recommend this show. I cried many times, mainly when the parents were interviewed. It's not easy to be different in a society that wants everyone to be the same or alike... But people on the spectrum are looked differently when they shouldn't. I hope all of you, in the spectrum or not, find true love and happiness. For parents, it's not easy, I know but everything is easier with love and understanding."
tt11904786,"This show is exactly what we all need. Some honest, genuine, heart-warming people trying to find love. My 13 yr old boys & my husband even enjoy this show! I'm so happy to hear there will be a 2nd season because I'm already trying not to watch the first season too fast. My smile was so big watching these people that I would find myself crying alittle cheering them on through their dates. I truly wish I could meet them all & be part of their lives. I wish I could partake in being a part of this show because I feel everyone needs to be more understanding of differences in people."
tt11904786,This is such a brilliant and heart warming series. All the participants deserve to find the love they're seeking. I found myself rooting for them all and it was such an eye-opening watch and their uncynical view of the world is so refreshing. I especially like Michael whos honesty is at turns hilarious and humbling. Congratulations to all involved in educating people on a very misunderstood condition.
tt11904786,"I am autistic like the characters in the show. I liked it for its funny moments and the refreshingly honest and intimate interviews with the participants. However, I have some criticisms - the main one being that they always seemed to match people with other autists. But there are plenty of successful relationships between neurotypical people with autistic people, so it seemed a bit presumptive and condescending to think that the best match for an autistic person is another autistic person. I hope that future episodes are less prescriptive as to whom the participants ""should"" be dating. Personally, I prefer to date neurotypical people because I like to have someone to help me interpret what is happening in social situations. Also, I've had casual sex too, and that is not covered in the show. Not all autistic people are interested in those wholesome ""take it slow"" relationships *all* of the time. Like it is with most people, there is a mix of encounters and emotional/physical needs among neurodivergent folks, perhaps even moreso because autistic people frequently don't feel a need to follow the status quo."
tt11904786,"Here's a review from an actual autistic.Good intentions don't fix a bad execution.Imagine a world where everyone was autistic, except maybe 1% of the people, and we made a series surrounding just them, called 'dating on the normy spectrum' and then put a whimsical soundtrack under it when they speak or move, every episode.Sounds belittling? Like a freakshow?Yep, because that's exactly what it feels like for us when they make a show about us and our condition to entertain others like we're 'so cute'.And people ask me how I became so cynical.I wish autistics would just have their own roles in actual series and movies without them being the subject of ridicule or morbid curiosity."
tt11904786,"The quest for love is universal and poignantly told through the eyes and hearts of those on the spectrum. Not only do we gain a deeper appreciation of those on the spectrum, but also an understanding of their various hopes and dreams; particularly around love. I watched the series twice over two days and loved it."
tt11904786,"Just came across this accidentally while browsing on Netflix & put it on as a background watch while online. My husband and I however, had put our phones down within minutes and were totally absorbed in the stories of lovely people with aspergers attempting to find love & their incredible families.We laughed. We cried. We were totally invested in every story & watched the whole series that evening. It's just wonderful & a perfect antidote to the horrible world out there. Just do yourself a favour & watch it."
tt11904786,"Genuine, and beautiful people looking for love and a future family. Each person in this show has such a positive outlook on life as they search for love.It's definitely heartwarming to watch them and their loving family. Everyone shows a new perspective."
tt11904786,"The thing that struck me most about this show is that dating on the spectrum is not so different from regular dating. We all want to connect with someone, love someone, build a life with someone. And some of us have a harder time than others in making that happen.I haven't been diagnosed as on the spectrum but I certainly share some of the characteristics of the people featured -- I don't like loud noise, I have trouble with big crowds nearby messing with my concentration, my senses are heightened, I have trouble reading cues from men.So I was really rooting for everyone. Some of the men featured in this show are the loveliest people, really extraordinary in their kindness. And many of the women are funny and smart. I applaud their willingness to get out there in the dating world."
tt11904786,Really the Australian continuation of the UKs The Undateables. Truely heart warming and enjoyable for anyone. Restores your faith in humanity. I really hope they are able to make another season once the pandemic blows over.
tt11904786,"That is what will happen when you watch this, especially the second season. These are some of the most genuine, honest people ever and the rest of us could learn a thing or two from them about what being truly human is about.Just a show about love."
tt11904786,"Although very similar in concept to the utterly charming British show ""The Undateables"" this is worth watching because it's so very sweet and eye opening. Everybody needs and deserves love and human connection, it's heartbreaking and also so inspiring to see them try and try and try to find their happy ever after. You will cheer for them and cry for them and wish for another season!"
tt11904786,"Oh man, I fell hard for Michael. He had me hooked the second i saw him. He's so smart and kind and oh any lady that ends up with him would be the luckiest woman on the earth.Maddi is soooo sweet. She really is funny, I'd love to be her friend!Anyone who would want to watch a heart warming TV reality show on Netflix should binge this. You wont regret it!"
tt11904786,Can not wait for more episodes. This show will make you cringe and smile. The honesty and positivity is inspiring.
tt11904786,"Id like to see these young people not only date other people on the spectrum but other youth in general their age
They don't necessarily have to date others on the
spectrum do they ????"
tt11904786,"My wife was totally sucked into this show so I watched a couple of episodes with her. It made me uncomfortable as the producers tried to assimilate the participants into traditional dating conformities.Why not take a different tack and come up with a way for them to become comfortable with each other on their own level?If someone is socially uncomfortable and perhaps awkward, it's seems cruel to set them up for failure.I'm certainly no expert on social norms but it really hurt to see their souls crushed again and again."
tt11904786,Wanna laugh? Want to cry? Want to flop over on the couch from belly laughs? This beautiful show will do all that for you!! I LOVE love on the spectrum!!
tt12451520,"EDITED REVIEW-
I wrote my earlier review after watching the second episode, and am editing now after watching the last episode.
I am in tears and the joy I am feeling right now is heart warming. This drama was so beautiful and fabulous... I have no words.
The story line is so good, you will be in tears and you will think again about K dramas, its that beautiful. Every character development is smooth, and its not complete 360 change which usually is shown. Its just becoming better. The costumes, music, scenes, dialogues, actors, editing, production... everything is so perfect I-... Its just awesome.
This show didn't disappoint me even for single second. The last episode is so beautifully, you will be crying that it ended and be happy about the ending the characters got.
And Boy did the actors act?! Kim Soo Hyun is famous I get it, but Oh Jung Se?!! Major shout out to him and Yoo Sae Ji!! these two acted so good that I got moved for real. I have seen Oh Jung Se acting as support actor in so many dramas, but this? This is how a good actor makes a supporting character into a Lead character. Its brilliant. New respect for both Oh Jung Se and Yoo Sae Ji.
This show is a must for everyone who thinks they are 'Not Okay'. This show will show you that being 'Not Okay' is 'okay'. You can have flaws too, and you will see that everyone has them too. You will see that being not okay is what makes you human.OLD REVIEW-
I have watched many k dramas, and this is very different.
Maybe because it's a Netflix original, but it has the touch of more than just k-drama. Whole production idea is different, including the story book display. Great concept. It's not the flowery, lovey dovey k drama fairy tale. It's a dark fairy tale. So i would recommend it for anyone, who likes k drama's concept of childhood friends meeting again and dark deep dialogues. To say it's playlist is good, would be an understatement. Just two episodes and I am already in love with it."
tt12451520,This drama is very different from your typical kdrama. It addresses the sensitive topic of mental health and it has me completely hooked after watching only the first few episodes. The actors have great chemistry; their charisma is insane. I really enjoyed the animations that were incorporated into the film. I highly recommend everyone to try experiencing this great drama for themselves because it will surely not disappoint.
tt12451520,"A very well made drama. Interesting storyline, cast, strong female lead, and great cinematography. It has deep meaning behind the plots. As long as you get over the 1 episode, which to me was kinda boring, you'll get hooked!"
tt12451520,"This k-drama feels different and I love different! I'm astounded with the animation, cinematography, writing, and acting. I smell Baeksang Arts Awards."
tt12451520,I just finished four episodes of this show and all i can say is WOW! This one is a MUST watch even if your not into korean tv shows you still have to watch this one. It's truly moving. The acting is simply amazing and the issues are real and I feel so many people can relate to the issues because in life everyone goes through alot of downs and this show truly covers peoples dark areas inside themselves they want to hide. Its a stunning show please watch if you haven't yet!
tt12451520,An absolute must watch kdrama of all time!!!! This has been upgrading Kdramas to another level of amazingness. You should experience it yourself and I'll bet that you will not regret or feel like youre wasting your time for this. This is a masterpiece.
tt12451520,"After watching many dramas, this is by far the best I have seen so far. This is why...
Every scene is beautiful in it's own way. I felt an emotional connection to all of the characters and have become invested in the story.
It brings the topic of mental health to the fore front so is very current.
The chemistry portrayed between the two lead actors is heart stopping......just kiss already!! 😘"
tt12451520,"This drama set the bar too high. The Acting, writing, scoring, cinematography, transition, screenplay, plot, the use of fairy tale metaphors, the chemistry between the actors, everything is just on another Level: Such a masterpiece.! It's Okay To Not Be Okay is more than just drama. It's A Life lesson."
tt12451520,"Even though this show just recently started streaming, it already got me hooked on its first four episodes. I can say that this is not your typical romantic comedy tv show because the story line doesn't just focus on that alone. It also promotes mental health awareness, which I think, is not always seen on tv shows. It shows that there are different kinds of mental illnesses and how each one should be given of importance and should not be neglected. Anyway, its a tv show that is worth watching and looking forward to the next episodes."
tt12451520,"This show itself is an apology letter to people who are mentally different from the society we have created thinking they don't understand us but it is exactly the opposite.
This show gives its audience what we expect from a classic yet different drama. The transaction from one scene to another is so smooth that you don't realise the effect as anything dramatic. The emotions of loneliness Sadness Happiness Jealousy Love are so amazingly portrayed that you feel like this is no big deal but will let you understand human nature.
Also how many times have you felt the need to ignore and not be bothered about those mental patients that we have separated from our regular society.
Think."
tt12451520,"I don't write reviews. However after seeing so many great reviews I felt like I had to say something. This was the most boring k-drama I have ever watched! Nothing actually happens it's just people talking. I understand how some people are saying ""it has real themes!"" and how great the portrayal of autism was etc etc..
Yes great to see autism being showcased in a series with real themes however based on just the entertainment value of this series I could not continue after episode 11. I was bored several episodes ago but kept on watching waiting for something to happen which nothing did and I just felt like I wasted my time."
tt12451520,"Let me say that the writers did a marvelous Job! On top of that the best of the best S. Korean actors portraying these characters and doing it brilliantly is great!
Oh Jung Se, you are going to win best supporting actor again! I've seen other dramas he's in and this one is something different for him, 🙇.. and he's doing it very well!
And to the main lead: The BEAUTIFUL n TALANTED: Kim Soo-Hyun, watching each episode you can feel his sadness, his love, the caring, he has for his brother (Oh Jung-Se) the character his portraying he nailed it!
Ye-Ji Seo, great character for you! Love it!
Worth to watch, if you like mysteries, and dark drama.."
tt12451520,"Literally a masterpiece. There's so much more than the visuals of main character. But the way this drama explain how life works through the fairy tale is just.. so pure. You don't even have to think of anything while watching it, the drama will heal you."
tt12451520,It's only been 4 episodes but it's the BEST K-Drama I've EVER watched. I'm confident they can keep up the energy! LOVE THE PAIRING!!!!
tt12451520,"Without a doubt, this series is the best South Korean series has been ever made in history without exaggeration.
In the beginning, I was not really interested in this show, but the perfect acting of its actors made me convinced that I would continue watching and with each episode the series' magnificence, enthusiasm and events increased. I want to talk about Soo-hyun Kim and Ye-ji Seo
They are undoubtedly the best original Drian romance story and their representation is convincing and realistic without making a frequent occurrence in all the other Korean soap operas.
This is the best Korean series and it makes the rest of the series garbage next to it.
Rate 9 but give it 10."
tt12451520,"This drama is perfecto, the main characters, the story, the ost and the chemestry is on point."
tt12451520,"Best k drama
Wouldn't change a thing about my review ."
tt12451520,""" It's okay to not be okay "" is a conceptional drama. It nailed the atmosphere and the whole gothic, fairytale, mysterious, dark and eerie. The addition of the books worked fantastically, the setting was brilliant and the clothes of the leading lady influential.The story, however, of the drama was stretched. Looking back into it, nothing happened for some episodes, and the final result was the kind of 'easy' conclusion of the whole mother mystery. The side stories were underdeveloped and boring too. So, no, they didn't work on the story too much, as they focused on the clever dialogue and the atmosphere.Nevertheless, even though storywise my rating would have been 5.5, I can't really rate it less than 7 because of the performances. The three main actors were breathtaking, especially in the dramatic scenes and one should only watch it for those performances only! (and no, I'm not a fan of the actors, but I can't stress enough how excellent they were! plz give them an award!!)So, overall, seven out of ten (10/10 for the actors, 5/10 for the story)"
tt12451520,"So many things about this series are exceptionally good. The journey of healing and learning of each of the characters from the main leads to the various patients is very moving. Admirably tasteful way to deal with mental and emotional issues on screen. The central love story is so involving because their pain feels profound. The incomparable Seo Ye Ji as writer Ko Moon-young is unforgettable - strong and vulnerable, finally a real step forward for K drama heroines. Enjoy each sentence she utters in her signature low voice. She has some memorable and often hilarious dialogue. A far cry from the Cinderella type heroines of early melodramas. And her outfits are stunning - perfectly suited to her tiny waist.
Kim Soo-hyun is well cast as caregiver Moon Gang-tae. He isn't a larger than life hero but instead a man with pain and burdens. He looks more mature here. The pairing of the two leads is right. Much better than The King Eternal Monarch where there was little chemistry between Lee Min Ho and Kim Go Eun.
Oh Jung-se gives a likable convincing performance as autistic Moon Sang-tae, In less capable hands the character could have been annoying or tiresome but he made the brotherly relationship very touching.
The production values are very high. From the well integrated animation of the stories to the quirky Tim Burton style house, it all has a high quality feature film standard feel to it. To cap it all off the ending is a good and satisfying one. For all those who have been disappointed by unsatisfying endings in K dramas this one helps to makes up for some of them.
A must watch."
tt12451520,"Best actor and actress , good chemistry both of them"
tt12451520,"I really wanted to say it is amazing but I can't.It starts off really well and interesting and yes the leads and some of the supporting cast did a great job in terms of the acting but for me I have to connect and have empathy with the characters and as far as the female leads character is concerned I could not. Yes she had a hard and toxic childhood, but that does not give permission to be cruel and spiteful as and when it suits her. I could have been won round had the scriptwriters not included a scene where she tears the butterfly's in half, but after seeing that scene, I just could not see her in any other light but cruel. As others have said there are many who have had a tough childhood and a turbulent relationship with her parents, but they grow up to be compassionate people regardless of their issues. If you dig deep enough you can always find reasons for even the most ruthless person, but that does not make it OK. As for being a famous children's book author - what parent would allow their children to read such dark storiesThere are some light and humorous moments, the autistic brother and the Director of the psychiatric ward are fantastic, but at times I found it very slow. I am at episode 8 and struggling to keep going. The premise of the story is good and it has some interesting themes, but I think the scriptwriters didn't take into account that once you present a character in a cruel light they risk losing support for that character."
tt12027034,I've watched almost every Netflix comedy special. This is totally original. I can't even imagine the feat of pulling off nearly 3 different hour long specials of IMPROV already knowing that they will be on Netflix. When my roommate suggested it I was not enthused. I was so wrong. These guys were the perfect duo to bring improv to the mainstream and out of its niche world.So talented!
tt12027034,"Personally, I didn't know their earlier works too much, except Middleditch's Silicon Valley. I was just about to sleep and wanted to put something boring that will make me sleep fast. Well... I couldn't sleep for the following 3 hours lmao!There is chemistry, there is genius, there is sincerity... You can feel they are really improvising, yet it also feels like a very well thought comedy show. I hope it receives the appreciation it deserves."
tt12027034,"These two are some of the most skilled performers working in Hollywood today, IMHO. They are genius at both scripted comedy (Middleditch in ""Silicon Valley"" and Schwartz on ""Parks and Rec"") and now, clearly, also improv. As the two forms require some overlapping but also some differing skills, the fact that M and S excel at both is beyond impressive. I'm confused by some reviews that complain these shows lack storylines (??) or occasionally misstep with a laugh or a plot point. IT'S IMPROV. Also, these two DO craft a story. With a beginning a middle and an end, a conflict, a resolution, multiple characters (more HUMAN-like characters than in many Hollywood films I see), a theme, the whole nine yards. ON THE FLY. IN FRONT OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. If you're complaining it's not perfect, you simply don't understand the years of training and the level of technical skill you're witnessing. This is long form improv at its very BEST Seriously, I bet so many of these guys' Hollywood friends are watching in awe and thinking ""holy s**t, I wish I was that good."""
tt12027034,"I'm a huge Middleditch and Schwartz fan. I've listened to every podcast they've been on, but I've never gotten to see them do long form improv together until now. These specials had me rolling in laughter. I've seen a lot of long form comedy in my life, and I'm confident to say they are the most natural at it.This is a comedy special unlike I've ever seen before, I love it so much and I already want more."
tt12027034,"If you are interested in seeing how improv looks at its peak, this is the place. These two guys are able to take a two minute story and turn it into an hour long show without missing a single piece of info. They create 5-10 characters they they will interchange and switch between throughout the show which is absolute magic. Couldn't recommend this show any higher."
tt12027034,"Improv enthusiasts may have beef with this special, as hardcore Del Close followers would attest to: improv is meant to be shared in the moment, not recorded or saved for posterity.That said, long form improv can sometimes produce some of the most hilarious, thought-provoking, and creative theater in modern times. Middleditch and Schwarz have the combined experience and comfort with one another that make for a long form improv experience unlike which I have ever seen.What makes it so unique is not just that it's recorded in front of a live audience, or that it's not some reboot of a beloved short-form improv show from the late '90s, but the fact that the duo allow themselves some leeway in breaking and bending ""the rules"".Performing long-form improv is a hard enough job all by itself, but the two create and weave stories that center around dozens of characters, they themselves playing all of them interchangeably. It is a feat I have not seen accomplished so smoothly across the hundreds of live performances I have witnessed both as a player and audience member. Usually you have a team to step in and help fill the gaps. These guys do it all by themselves and manage to patch it all together in the end.I understand if the old school enthusiasts cry foul that this was not only recorded but that so many rules were broken. Yes, the duo sometimes forget which character is which, or where they're headed, or what the plot is or ""why"" in general, but the fact that they are so quick on their feet to recover and the fact that they make light and fun of this imperfection -- because what mere mortal could remember all they're spinning?! -- is part of why this is so entertaining and endearing.When long-form improv becomes more of a household thing (streaming services will take note from this success) we will look back in 10/20/30 years and cite Middleditch and Schwarz as the main influencers.They weren't the first to do this, but they're among the best, and will be cemented that way thanks to Netflix."
tt12027034,"This show had me in stitches before the improv even started!
I took some drama classes back when I was a kid, but I wasn't really into them beyond the guaranteed 'A'. In those classes we of course did improv sketches, each of which was exactly as groan-worthy as you are imagining teenage acting to be.
But these two gentlemen are on another level entirely!
Together they demonstrate exactly what mastery over the format entails: the adaptability, the imagination, and the receptiveness to each other's ideas is both phenomenal and a privilege to watch.
Even when one of them goes completely rogue and you think there is no way of salvaging a bit, they manage to pull it off with gleeful smiles and tons of purely joyous energy.
The zaniness of the individual sketches prove without a doubt that there are no writers involved, because no sane person would put pen to paper to make that s*** up.
10/10 Stars. Great show even if you have no interest in imrov."
tt12027034,"I always enjoyed a bit of improv comedy, but man is this fantastic. They weave a full narrative out a few bits of information and don't miss a detail. Even when you think they have reached the end of something or forgotten a piece, which they do at times, they are able to bring it back in a great way. The starts and ends of the segments can be dicy for any improv group and they are no different. But I think it takes only three minutes before they are off and going.Even if you have never seen improv comedy before this is a fantastic introduction. It is one of the funniest comedy's that Netflix has to offer, and frankly it is joy to watch. I wish they did more of them."
tt12027034,"When it said at the start ""everything in this show is improvised and made up on the spot. Nothing is written or prepared beforehand"", I thought that might be an excuse. It's really not. This is the only thing for a while to get me literally loling (laughing out loud, overall this has taken more time to type, but I think it sounds snappy - also, you probably already knew what I meant). I really hope they put more of them on Netflix because I'm about to finish them after watching the first 2 yesterday. I see improv get mocked a lot but now I think I'm about to get into it."
tt12027034,"Just do it. I was completely taken aback, this is comedy genius like I've never seen and I had no idea how good of a time I was in store for-- Middleditch and Schwartz deserve all the accolades they receive. My belly hurt from laughter. Its so rare to be on your own, watching something that makes you crack up like this! I've watched the first episode twice and it gets even better the second time around, now spotting visual cues they give each other where they almost break the 4th wall but don't. I hope they win awards!"
tt12027034,"Doing long-form improv for over 45 minutes is impressive enough by itself, the fact that this show is hysterical is almost a bonus. Incredible talent by two comics willing to put in serious effort for their jokes. Can not recommend this enough!"
tt12027034,This is incredibly smart and surprisingly creative. Really funny. Could watch a whole lot more of these.
tt12027034,"It's not bad, but I have to say that Brazilian's trio ""Barbixas"" are way better, so I was expecting another level of improv."
tt12027034,"I guess these guys are talented. I don't know. Maybe if you're into improv, you'll find this enjoyable. It was a challenge to make it through an episode. Is it comedy? I don't get it. If you don't have anything nice to say, ya know. The one guy's kind of funny looking."
tt12027034,"These two are perfection together. Please make more today, y'all are so quick witted and smart"
tt12027034,"I laughed so hard, I developed asthma. Watching all 3 episodes back to back, could exponentially increase the risk. Be warned!"
tt12027034,"I'm not a big fan of improv but I love these guys so I thought I'd check it out, definitely expecting to be bored after a few minutes and switching it off but ended up watching the whole thing, it was hilarious!"
tt12027034,"I think I have never laughed harder watching anything in my life. They are simply hilarious. I completely recommend everyone watches it. My stomach aches from laughter, I almost peed myself at least twice in each episode and my face hurts."
tt12027034,"Middleditch & Schwartz give us unprecedented humor sourced from a simple conversation with the audience. This is a great example of long form improv performed at pinnacle experience. Consistent, smart and wild at times, this dynamic duo never lacks to entertain me."
tt12027034,"Completely original and so funny! I'd love to see more of this in the future! Great characters, a true talent for comedy."
tt12027034,"This was generally the most authentic, belly laughing show I have watched in years. This simply reinforced why I'm a fan of both Thomas and Ben. I really hope this becomes a tour down under"
tt12027034,"This is improv. this is comedy. this is amazing.
first of all these specials are hilarious non stop laughter. schwartz and middleditch are really funny guys.
what they're doing is not easy but they are masters of it. it is so incredibly hard to do improv well but to do it for 50mins straight with each time being completely different and original is truly amazing.
plus it's something new to comedy specials on netflix. it hasn't been done before and they've nailed it.
i really hope this gets the attention it deserves because these guys could be revolutionaries and hopefully bring improv to the limelight."
tt12027034,A show like this works MUCH better when the performers are funny and talented.
tt12027034,"Okay, that might be overselling, but this truly is amazing. If you like crying from laughing so hard or your gut hurting from laughing, this is for you. Truly just so fun, you feel like you're actually part of the live audience."
tt12027034,"If you need a good laugh, this is the show for you. But it's only 3 episodes, so just keep rewatching them because they're that good. I'm anxiously awaiting more and whenever we're able to go back to seeing live shows I would pay to see these two!"
tt7978538,"So I have a 5 year and a 2 year old. My eldest has watched this since he was 3 and he's now literally a maths whizz! He just gets numbers in a way me or my wife never did. He knows his square numbers up 20... and pictures them as squares... obvious maybe to us now as adults but I don't ever remember being taught in that way. He understands odds and even numbers, odds having an 'odd top' when arranged in a column of 2 wide. He gets prime numbers, and is able to tell me the prime numbers up to 109. He impressed the head of the school when they were singing ""The 12 days of Christmas"" she had asked what all the gifts added together would make (I'm pretty sure she wasn't serious) but my son imagined a large step shape and answered ""78!"". She was blown away!So in no way is this show ""dumbing down"" kids tv content. That's a totally ridiculous comment. It's made my kids smarter than they would be without it- it's better then watching about dinosaurs or lego!Oh and because of this show my 2 year old knows his 2,3,4,5 and 10 times tables. It's actually insane. Love this show."
tt7978538,"My kid loves this show, he's learned so much and Can count to over a 100 at 4"
tt7978538,"My five year old not only LOVES this show but has learned so much from it. Not only does it teach counting but addition, subtraction, skip counting, square roots and so much more but in a way that kids understand and learn from! And the short episode are perfect and don't make it overwhelming. One of the best learning shows for kids ever!"
tt7978538,Thoughtfully created individuals that are perfect for teaching concepts in a concise manner. Engaging episodes that other learning programs should emulate.
tt7978538,This show is fun for kids to watch and its all math. Brilliant!
tt7978538,"Numberblocks is a pretty solid show in my opinion. The animation is amazing and the songs are pretty catchy. Not to mention that some episodes even teach things that aren't even apart of preschool mathematics such as Multiplication and Division (take that, Team Umizoomi)! Aside from the wildly toxic fanbase that even makes Vyond look sane in comparison, my only problem is that One can become a pretty arrogant blockhead at times. But overall, I recommend the show and if you hate it, I'm okay with it."
tt7978538,Both of my kids are really into this cartoon. They watch over and over. It really solidifies Math for them both. My son hasn't even started kindergarten yet. He's was already naturally inclined for mathematics but now he is completely ahead of the game. My daughter loves the show as well. She will go to 3rd grade knowing much more this year thanks to your show.
tt7978538,"I can't say enough good things about this show. Whether it's the visual representation of numbers and the ability to relay the point across to the audience or it catchy songs; Numberblocks is like a math class your kids will want to attend. It's characters are well written with personalities of their own and they show pride in their numerological abilities, for example there is a square club which contains 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 etc.The show also strongly grasps all 4 of the basic mathematical functions: +-×÷. It explains these in a way that's fun for children and as long as they have at least some interest in math, they should be able to grasp the concepts and do basic math."
tt7978538,"My about to turn 5 yr old is adding, subtracting and even doing simple multiplication. She loves numbers and really learned a lot from this show."
tt7978538,"My nephew used to use my Netflix for fun..one time his mother asked him few questions of maths for fun and to all ou suprise he was just too much for us to handle
He could multiply 25*25 divide numbers knew all tables could do most of the stuff we could just imagine him do.He is just 6-7 year old...after lot of inquiry about who taught him this he said number blocks...took use really some time to understand he watched it on Netflix.Great stuff...I think his ability to enjoy the show made him understand the simplicity of maths involved.We are trying to get him lear more, but we find his ability without this show... really great full."
tt7978538,This is a baby show about counting to 3.Educational. I guess.Fun. Maybe.Entertaining. No way.Kinda dumbed down. Yes.The show is boring. Being colorful and 3d doesn't cut it.Its 2020 and we have a boring educational show. Back in my day we had cool mature fun children show about day to day life that didn't involve hand holding.Now in 2020 where we are supposed to be advanced we've gone backwards to count to 3.Parents if they weren't lazy and stupid busy they should be the ones teaching their children how to count. Not TV. TV is there to entertain. Who watches TV to learn to add 1 + 1? That makes no sense.TV has tons of hand holding and toxic shows that parents don't mind their children watching. Number blocks is really boring..
tt7978538,"I wish they taught math like this wonderfully when I was a kid myself. It is immensely engaging. Kudos to the whole team for this masterpiece. Hands down the best early math education series I have ever seen. Through catchy songs, vibrant animations, and engaging storytelling, it keeps children entertained while they learn. It uses colorful blocks with numbers to represent mathematical concepts, making it tangible and easier for young minds to grasp fundamental math ideas. It lays a strong foundation for mathematical understanding in early education, fostering a positive attitude towards numbers and math."
tt7978538,"My three year old is obsessed with counting, addition, and is beginning to learn simple multiplication. I can take absolutely no credit. This show breaks things down in a way which children understand and retain without even realising, because they love the characters, the storylines and the songs. And to be honest, so do I. ""High Five"" is definitely in my top ten tunes, somewhere after Jimmy Jazz and before Heart-shaped Box.I hope the writers can find a way to make more advanced mathematics enjoyable and easy, otherwise I shall be cursing their names when my son wants to start algebra next year."
tt7978538,"My 6 year old and 4 year old absolutely love this show! It has helped both children with having a above and beyond math comprehension over their peers. Their teachers want to know the secret. This one I can't credit for, tell them all its Numberblocks!! Thank you all! The show is even entertaining to me!! Thanks again for creating this fabulous show!"
tt7978538,"This show inspired people not only to learn math and be smart, but to make their own NB OCs, fan shows, gijinkas, etc. I even did that too.It even spawned a community but it is so damn toxic, probably because of how many extremely toxic kids there are, they are so toxic, so mean and SO, BURGER FLIPPIN', ANNOYING. Good thing I was never in the community because I don't know how to get in it. Lucky me! (7's catchphrase)."
tt7978538,"It's a counting show, but it makes counting fun. It's kind of like School House Rock, but just with math.My boys love watching it and my 3year old can now count to 12! Before he would count from 1-5 but skip #4. He also knows that 3+3 make 6 and other random ways of adding numbers together.
The songs are catchy and the characters are so fun! I love this show so much. My sister-in-law also loves this show and it helped her son count by 10's to 100 and he can also count by 5'sCan't recommend enough!"
tt7978538,Extremely fun way to learn math. My daughter 5 years old learned great deal and loves to watch it
tt7978538,My four year old loves this show and in the process is getting familiar with numbers. He's watched all episodes multiple times and accurately recites equations. Pretty genius show!
tt7978538,"Its literally a ripoff of numberjacks
And kids are uploaded numberblocks on tiktok
I think numberjacks is an og
But numberblocks??? I liked blues clues,mickey mouse clubhouse more than numberblocks
Bad show through."
tt7978538,"My three year old daughter got so into this show, she started doing and understanding multiplication and division. Unfortunatly when 100 came along she became so terrified she leaves the room and refuses to watch numberblocks anymore. Maybe because 100 has one eye and a deep voice? I hope the furture episodes are less scary for the little ones who are old enough to understand some of it. Brilliant show otherwise."
tt7978538,"I Love This Show, I Could Watch It All The Day, I Hope There Is SEASON 6, I Love The Animation, And Also I Love The Character's Voice, And Btw I Hope BBC Launches 6th Season!"
tt7978538,"(Update 2022: This review is heavily opinionated and most likely outdated. I made this... thing when I was 15 and still figuring things out about social media and life in general. (I'd delete it but I don't know how to delete IDMB review's oof-) I had the mindset of ""show good, fandom bad"" back then, since I experienced it first hand. I have since left the community and have grown to see that the things I was complaining about (while still a bit morally questionable) were far from as bad as things could get online. (Boy was I naïve back then) There was a lot of toxicity in this community. Which comes naturally for a fandom based on kids show (Hello My Little Pony) and while that obviously does not excuse any of these people's behavior, I have since seen just how bad things could get. And no longer stand by this review. (Another reason being that it's fandom has nothing to do with the show itself why'd I even bring it up?) Feel free to report this if you wish (not like I use the website anyway...) However, until that happens, enjoy this trainwreck of a review!)I Love This Show! It Teaches kids About Suprisingly Advanced Math Skills In A Way That Is Not Confusing. Most Kids Shows That Try to Teach Subjects Like Multiplication Just Tell You What The Awnsers Are And That's It. But Numberblocks Teaches These Kinds Of Subjects In A Fun Interesting Way! The Show Is Also Adorable! Two's Song Touches Me Every Time!The Only Reason I'm Giving It A Nine A Not A Ten Is Becuase Of It's Community. The Numberblocks Community Is Not A Child Freindly Environment! It Includes Extremely Toxic People, Surprisingly Graphic Imagery For A Community Based On A Kids Show, And All Sorts Of Other Things Kids Should Not Be Seeing!In Conclusion, If You Have A Little One, I Reccomened Putting Them On Numberblocks! But, And I'm Saying This As Someone In The NBC (NumberBlocks Community) Make Sure They Stay Away From It's Teenage Fanbase At All Costs!"
tt9288860,"""Trash truck"" the cartoon series is a return to simple age appropriate cartoon stories for preschoolers. This series perfectly captures the innocence and thought process of a preschooler. Minus all the obnoxious intense, fast pacing and toy marketing. Story first. The relationships between the characters are respectful and thoughtful with just the right amount of whimsy. This show demonstrates how a preschooler has the potential to use their imagination as a tool to navigate the every day world around them. I grew up on Glen Keanes character illustrations myself. Glen Keane productions on Netflix is one of my favorite things to happen during this dismal year. I'm so happy to share this show with my 3 year old son knowing the content is thoughtful and high quality. Cannot say enough good things!"
tt9288860,"I usually hate kids shows but this is one that I don't mind watching over and over. The animation and music are wonderful. The characters are adorable. Overall, just a very sweet show!"
tt9288860,"This show hits just the right spot for this Kiwi British family watching in Auckland. We love it - a mix of the gentle BBC shows and Pixar animation - an instant hit with our little boy, who also happens to have a sister called olive! Dad loves all the background humour and the gorgeous early morning or evening glow... a well travelled Aussie character in the mix is a treat too haha!"
tt9288860,"I just read a review that headlined ""for Caucasian's Only."" If the color of someone's skin is the first thing that you notice, diversity is not your primary concern. Great show for children of any ethnicity. The child talks to a trash truck, a bear, and a raccoon. Children and parents need to listen more to the moral of the story with good television shows, than the characters giving the messages."
tt9288860,"The date was March 25 2021, the weather was cool but my temper was not. I was sitting through hour 3 of ""Fruit Salad, yummy yummy"" sung by what I can only describe as a group of hippy's on acid who all happen to think they're Australian. My son had accidentally got ahold of the remote and somehow switched the show to something new, something gentle, something nostalgic.... and that show my friends was: Trash Truck!It is a wonderful blend of non-wiggles related content and more non-wiggles related content. The stories are wonderful, the animation is wonderful and it also has nothing to do with The Wiggles.All in all it's a fantastic show... did I mention it has nothing to do with The Wiggles?"
tt9288860,"A cute little show that reminds me of something Melissa & Doug would make. A perfect show for parents who don't want hidden messages or annoying people and cartoons. My 2 year old thinks the pizza episode was so funny and silly. All the characters are warm and fuzzy, and it's nice to hear Kevin - I mean Brian, in my kids show."
tt9288860,"I stumbled across Trash Truck with my 2 year old and we are both in love! I love the animation, characters, and theme song. It holds his attention and makes him laugh out loud. We will be eagerly awaiting a second season and recommending this to all my mom friends."
tt9288860,This series is fun for both kids and adults. There is an emotional and educational theme for growing little minds and entertainment and real world scenarios for today's life. Well played Netflix
tt9288860,There are not many Netflix shows my son and I enjoy together. This is definitely one of them! Absolutely love it.
tt9288860,"My son and I just finished Season 1. Relaxing show to watch before bed. Trash Truck's character is adorable! It cracks me up that he can do things like fit in Hank's house and cross a log. There is something so poignant about how Trash Truck lifts Hank up and carries him on his ""shoulders."" Delightful!"
tt9288860,"My last cartoon review got a disastrous ratio (20 out of 20 people hated on it, but the show I reviewed wasn't even that good), but hopefully the ratio on this review will be better, because Trash Truck is an outstanding preschool show.I love Disney movies, and the mastermind behind many of them was Glen Keane - The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, you name it. He retired from Disney and went on to pursue his own things. His own projects have been outstanding so far. Over the Moon was a great Netflix movie and my favorite animated film this year. This preschool show, which all of the Keane family is involved in, is also great.The animation is beautiful, worthy of Pixar. The stories are quaint but not boring, and the whole show is heartwarming, because it's about the friendship between a boy, his garbage truck, and their talking animal friends. There's also a strong emphasis on family, and the characters are all unique in their own way.There's something for everyone - there's great animation, good role models, strong characterization, comedy, heartwarming moments, talking animals, and a garbage truck. Definitely watch it if you liked Disney or Over the Moon."
tt9288860,"My roommates 3 year old likes it, but the episodes are too short, and with only 12 episodes I got tired of having to rewatch them again every hour. What I don't get is why the garbage truck can't talk if the animals can talk. I despise kids shows that have grunting and moaning characters without dialogue."
tt9288860,The most adorable show. My 1yr old baby is obsessed with Trash Truck and Hank. The stories are adorable. Thank you guys for making the sweetest show.
tt9288860,"What I love:
Interesting plots that aren't too complicated for my 2 year old to understand.Pleasant central characters: the creators some how managed to inuíte an oddball group (Trash Truck, a little boy, a Bear, a Raccoon, and a Mouse) and make them a fun, cohesive group.The language is simple and the dialogue is basic enough for my infant daughter to be able to understand much of it. She's actually using works she learns watching the show.Genuinely enjoyable family dynamic - who doesn't Love Olive? Also, Mom and Dad's brief appearances keep the show grounded in reality.The episodes are entertaining - ESPECIALLY season 2. Do yourself a favor and watch ""Beach Day"" on Season 2. It's an absolute masterpiece!Things I don't love:only one thing - I WANT MORE EPISODES PER SEASON!!!! Give me like 30 ten minute episodes ;)"
tt9288860,"We are VERY selective when it comes to shows we let our 2 year old watch. This show is at the top of our list of favorites with the likes of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. It is slow paced and sweet, with kind and polite characters. No subliminal messages, and nothing scary or intense. Just wholesome, happy TV for little ones, with silly scenes that make both my toddler and I laugh out loud! This show checks all the boxes, and was clearly created by parents! I sure hope the series is continued, we are big, big fans."
tt9288860,My son adores this and its so relatable. Some subtle big kid lessons woven into a fun set of innovative characters. Always culminating in the simple universal things that make all of us happy. This is one kids show I don't mind binge watching.
tt9288860,"When I found this animation, I literally could not believe it was real. My son LOVES trash trucks and looks like the little boy, Hank. It was like the show was created just for him. I thought my son's obsession was a little much, but clearly there is an audience for it. Now I just wish there was a HighBeam toy out there! Thank you to the creators for bringing this adorable story to life!"
tt9288860,"So happy to have found this show accidentally! We spent all of 2020 watching and getting tired of Cocomelon, my husband and I were so over the songs!
Found Trash Truck, and we thought no way is our rambunctious little one year old grandson going to sit through such a pleasant little show, right from the start he sat down and was immediately engaged. I hope there are a dozen more seasons ahead. My husband and myself truly enjoy watching this over and over again with our grandson, we whistle the happy theme song all day and it doesn't get annoying. Do yourself a favor, unwind with this series. The voices, the content and the calmness of this soothing and beautifully animated show will forever be in our home and our grandchildren's homes. Good on you for putting this out there for us! Thank you!"
tt9288860,I'm pretty selective with what I let my almost two year old son watch and we both love this show! My son is obsessed with everything about it down to the catchy whistle theme song. I hope they make more episodes!
tt9288860,"This show is cute. The visuals are nice. They're gentle on little one's eyes. The slow dialogue is perfect. There aren't any flashy images. It's great. But it stops at that. It's not diverse at all. It is only white people. And very rarely will you see someone of color even in the background. I'm teaching my child to include others and that everyone is different. But this show doesn't teach him that, so I'm going to pass."
tt9288860,"Not only is this cartoon well written, but it debuted at a time when my granddaughter noticed the 'Trash Truck' outside! She runs around yelling trash truck, trash truck. When outside, the driver noticed her interest, so when he comes by he stops and raises the bin, dumping everything into the truck! She loves it!
Then when they want trash truck to fly they go to an airport and talk to a pilot. My granddaughter knows her grandpa flies planes and she said papa fly!
For us, the timing of this debut was fantastic!"
tt9288860,"My son loves Henk, Trash truck and the gang. It's a great series which I enjoy watching with him.It's well animated and funny at times. The low pace and colourful scenes are addicting... in a good way.My son, now 1,5 years old, is (in his own ""words"") begging me from time to time to put this on.And more often than not, I'm very much willing to do so. Because it's just really fun to watch.The length of an episode is perfect for the time span of the little ones (and the bigger ones).I sure hope the creators and Netflix are willing to create more seasons. Just 2 seasons of this show feels underrated. So please: give us more Trash Truck!"
tt9288860,"My little man (1.5 years old) is absolutely obsessed with this show. We quote trash truck before bed and are not allowed to put anything else on the tv for him! We read the book atleast 5x a day and look forward to additional books, stuffed animals that may come out moving forward!"
tt9288860,"Thank you to everyone who created this gorgeous little show. So simple, beautiful and well made. I wish more kid shows would put in this kind of effort."
tt0120586,"I loved this movie, it's terrific. Edward Norton is great here, all the acting performances are good. A very important social message.I would have given it a 10 if it were longer. I wish there were more scenes of his thought process of leaving the skinhead movement, and more scenes of him bonding with his little brother (Edward Furlong) and slowly getting him to rework his worldview and frame of reference as well. The ending is also a little abrupt.I just wish for more of the film. Nothing wrong with what we got. It's already a phenomenal work of art that I implore every person of every race to watch. Obviously the subject matter is skinheads, but the theme of de-radicalizing your brain is universal and is much needed in today's world."
tt0120586,"The tragedy of evil is that in trying to stop it, you create it. So if you want to stop doing evil actions, you also have to stop seeing evil because to see evil you must project evil... therefore, you create evil. If you genuinely want to be moral, you got to make a counterintuitive move of giving up all morality. All of your moral rules give them all away. Only then you will truly be moral but if you go around touting your morality, and telling people how moral you are and how immoral they are, that immediately tells that you're not embodying your morality. A genuinely moral person would never do that because true morality is not based on rules, it's not a self-image that you adopt, it's not a list of 10 commandments that you follow. When you think you're so righteous and so moral, you will go and kill people in the name of your morality which is precisely what creates evil."
tt0120586,"I give this movie a 10 because1) Edward Norton was the meaning of masterful acting, you could just look at his eyes and understand every little pain he felt and caused. His smile and manner switching before and after was so distinguishing that if you did not speak English you could just follow him.2) cinematography : not only the black and white phase was amazing some other shots was masterful3) the cause , I watched this movie in 2019 and it is as important and as relevant as it was 21 years ago"
tt0120586,"This is a fantastic movie because no matter what side you're on in life, this movie shows them all, good and bad, right or wrong. I also agree with the point in the movie that proves that people can change for the better and straighten things out in their head to do the right things in life. Yes, things in our world have changed, some for the good, some for the bad, but just because you might not agree with some of it, doesn't mean you can play God and try to make things ""your way"" and this shows exactly what happens when you try. This movie talks about all walks of life and the struggles we all have in what beliefs are right and wrong. Yes this movie is brutal and violent, but also truthful to the past and unfortunately still sometimes the present. This movie is about race, but not only 1 race is singled out and fed to the dogs, they all are. So, go into this movie with an open mind and your mind will come out full."
tt0120586,"I have been wanting to see this movie for a long time, since my English teacher mentioned it in our class in grade ten. Gosh I wished I wouldn't have waited all this time to finally watch it, although maybe it's a good thing cause I would have probably been a little bit more traumatized at 14... This movie is exceptional!!! Makes u think, makes you frustrated, makes you wanna scream and even makes you cry! Edward Norton is just phenomenal playing the role of a freak skin head and even more so playing this skin head who finally realizes how stupid he was and tries to protect his younger brother. Edward Furlong also does an amazing job!!! This film is moving in so many ways...I can't even describe how real and heartfelt it felt. I definitely think Edward Norton should have won the Oscar for his performance, cause he was absolutely terrific! I can't get why they didn't gave it to him... This movie will surely stay on my mind for a while now... just thinking that some place in the world things like that still happen...it crushes my heart. This is a wonderful movie that every single person should see at least once in his life... Watch American History X, it totally worth it!"
tt0120586,"American History X is a movie of its own. It has a little bit of everything in the way it touches you. This of course making it a very though provoking film. There isn't a genre you can place this film in because it is a not a crime story, action or even a simple drama instead it is a humanistic thriller. What it is about, is the battle over ourselves.Who better than to display these wild but common complexities within people than Edward Norton. The range he shows here is astounding in only his fifth movie. Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a skin head that realizes through cruel yet necessary events in his life that he has gone down the wrong path. When he comes out of jail he attempts to stop his brother played Edward Furlong from going down the same road he had done. Through all his efforts though some things just prove to be inevitable. Avery Brooks also gives a great performance as Derek Vinyard's former teacher and now principal of his former school. His words may not be of the most inspiring but his actions and messages sent across are subtle yet strong and to the point.Norton's performance though wasn't just about range but exploring different dimensions of life. Whether it proved to be psychological, social or even political on a certain level. It is a transforming performance revealing something mind blowing and eye opening. That we, and this includes anyone, can take a devastating turn in life no matter how intelligent we are or thoughtful. That the person that determines the outcome of your life is yourself whether it is good or bad. Norton's realizations aren't through teachings such as the ones that got him in jail but they are through the events in the time he spent in jail. He saw the truth for himself realizing then what is false and what is real.The screenplay written by David McKenna is about as versatile as the performance Norton gives. Not only because of the Derek Vinyard character but because of the characters involved in his life. For example the root of his evil did not come from the murder of his father but rather his father himself. Through just a conversation at breakfast did his negative thoughts get really embedded eventually then leading to them dramatically taking over his mind and way of life. Only when his father got killed did these negative thoughts seem justified. The way this screenplay and direction was able to display this message in just a plethora of other underlying tones was spectacular.What makes this movie great though is that you can truly find yourself in the messages delivered. As much as the main character might not seem relevant or connected to many people it his emotions and functioning of his mind that all of us are able to connect with. Yet what makes a movie great is not simply the message or messages sent across but how powerfully they are delivered. American History X delivers its multiple and intertwining messages about as powerfully as I've seen from a film."
tt0120586,"I was expecting a kind of a moralistic movie with an overly present, almost preaching like message. The movie however turned out to be extremely powerful mainly due to the professionalism it was made with.The movie its story is told 'beautifuly' in black & white and color. The quite original directing from Tony Kaye gives the movie a nice visual style and certain atmosphere. The story itself isn't that complicated or extremely original on its own and perhaps at most points even predictable but the way the story is told is phenomenal. This is not a movie with an happy ending or a movie that provides a solution to the racial discrimination problems. It shows what is NOT the solution to the problems and that everything that is occurring is like a vicious circle. The movie does not give a hopeful message but instead shows the dangers and pain you're causing to yourself and your close environment when you're thinking as a white supremacist.As an anti Neo-Nazi movie this movie works really powerful. I think that its a really good and important thing that this movie is often shown in classrooms.Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as two brothers.Also surprising good was the musical score by Anne Dudley who had already won an Oscar for ""The Full Monty"", the year before.This was a movie that surprisingly impressed me. As a movie its extremely powerful and important.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
tt0120586,"A good friend of mine suggested this film, and I really didnt know what to expect going in, but after this film was over, I sat in stunned silence. I knew that racism was horrible, but I found through this film that it does not come without a terrible price..the loss of love, friends, family...and the realization that everything that you believed to be true isnt always the way things are. Edward Norton's performance takes the viewer through this journey, and its not a pretty one. He goes from an bright young man, to a vengeful bigot, to a remorseful excon with a brothers life in jeopardy, and you feel as though you are looking in on someones life in the course of 2 hrs. All of the acting in this film is first rate, and the ending wasnt quite as predictable as others might have you believe...it is quite shocking, as is much of the film. It causes quite a debate on the way people view others whos skin color is not the same. As Dr. King said, judge me not on the color of my skin, but on the content of my character. I live with racism, because I am a black man living in America...it exists, but if we educate ourselves like the main character in AHX, it wont stay around for much longer. Hopefully it wont be too late, as it was for him. Peace and Love, JB33  Rating 5 stars"
tt0120586,"The concept of a reformed neo-Nazi is so intriguing that it's a wonder there haven't been more movies on this topic. Once you see ""American History X,"" however, you will understand why. The movie's racial themes are provocative and unsettling, far outside the comfort zone of the average viewer, and the movie additionally has the challenging task of explaining how a violent criminal changed his ways. Does the movie convincingly explain that transition? Not entirely.It's an engrossing movie, nonetheless. It uses a device more common in literature than in the movies: inter-cutting between several story-lines. First we see Derek (Ed Norton) as a free man, newly released from prison, and having developed a conscience. Then we see earlier points in his life when he was a white supremacist, and finally the prison experience that changed him. The non-chronological approach is very effective, making the movie about as engaging as any thriller, even though the plot itself offers few surprises. Had the film followed a more conventional timeline, we'd have quickly grown impatient waiting for plot developments that were inevitable. With the way it's structured, our focus is on the process more than the outcome: How did a bright kid like Derek become a racist? And what turned him around?The movie takes great pains to show how articulate the younger Derek is when he justifies his hatred of blacks by citing the statistics of black crime. (His more personal motive is that blacks murdered his father.) His arguments hit upon common politically conservative themes as he finds fault with affirmative action, glorification of criminals like Rodney King, and liberals who blame (white) society for the problems facing blacks. But Derek takes this reasoning a step further and argues that blacks have a ""racial commitment to crime."" Of course, by taking that step, he undermines his own arguments. For example, how does his harping about ""personal responsibility"" square with his belief in judging people for factors beyond their control, like their race? Responsibility requires choice. If race were the reason for black crime, then black criminals would be morally blameless. But no character points out such contradictions in Derek's views. When he debates a liberal teacher played by Elliot Gould, the gentle Gould character acts like a milquetoast, unable to provide a strong rebuttal. It's a powerful scene, and more than plausible: as in real life, people aren't always prepared with eloquent answers, even when confronted by someone with indefensible views.Still, it's disconcerting that the film never fully addresses the ""intellectual"" side of his bigotry. The main impetus for Derek's change is internal: once he learns to respect himself, he starts respecting others--a nice thought, no doubt, but I'm not sure it would be a strong enough fulcrum for change in this character's racial views. Although some would assume that Derek is too intelligent to remain racist, I would assume he's too intelligent not to come up with yet more rationalizations.There are other factors at work, too, including his treatment by white inmates and his befriending of a charming black inmate (Guy Torry). But all this seems to provide, at most, an emotional response to the earlier scenes. The movie made me realize how much the public attitude toward race has changed since the late 1960s, when optimistic films like ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" confronted racism by creating immensely likable African-American characters and ignoring any other social and cultural tensions that might pose a barrier to interracial relationships. In AHX, almost all the black characters are gang members and criminals, and there seems to be an underlying cynicism in the film's reluctance to provide a clear-cut refutation to Derek's right-wing arguments. Implicitly, the movie argues that there's a cycle of hatred going on between white and black gangs, and that the white racists aren't solely to blame for this situation. Aside from his relationship with Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) and his prison friend, the basis for Derek's turnaround is largely negative: he realizes that he's no better than the black outlaws he so despises. That isn't exactly the most inspiring message about race relations.My main reason for wanting to watch this movie in the first place was to understand better how an extremist hatemonger could change. But that turns out to be the least convincing aspect of the film. The root of the problem probably lies in the conception. The filmmakers started with the intelligent skinhead character, then they thought, ""What sorts of events will lead this character to transform?"" That's why the conclusion feels just a tad contrived. It's a good film, overall, but ironically where it's weak is in the very area that makes the story the most interesting."
tt0120586,I have LOVED this movie since the day I saw it! I own it & will never sell or give it away! It's topic will ALWAYS be relevant & controversial. I can watch it every few years or so & still love it as much as the first time!
tt0120586,I think not a masterpiece but a good movie. When i see the rating i thought it will be great and when i finished just doesnt that great. But again i recommend to watch cause like i said a good movie
tt0120586,"A few minor disconnects in the plot? Where are the connects? Everybody's just responding to the volatility of the subject and to Ed Norton's charisma. The rest of this patched-together nonsense is about as meaningful as a 93-minute Nike ad. That director has no idea what he's doing, and won't be heard from again, except as a neurotic nuisance. Talk about the emperor's new clothes! If everyone's so hot on ""powerful"", see ""Slam"" and discuss that one for a change."
tt0120586,"One of the reasons I like the film is that the racism isn't shoved down your throat. It's subtle and believable. There's no characters standing around screaming about ""Those goddamn Mexicans, I don't want THEM changing my locks so THEY can rob the place with their little essays!"", right in front of them. The acting is great all around, and Edward Norton gives one of the best performances of all time. I can't believe he didn't win best actor. While I haven't seen Benji's performance, I doubt he was half as good as Norton. The film is also highly inspirational and moving. How is it that this wasn't even nominated for best picture, while Crash was AND won? Crazy.This should be shown in schools."
tt0120586,"Anyone who missed the 90's and early 00's never will know how big Edward Norton was, he ruled the world. But two movies were a step above all else and this is the second one. He owns this movie role and character in a spectacular fashion. After you watch this go watch the rest of the gold he was apart of in the 90's-00's. Fight club, Primal Fear, Rounders, The Score, Red Dragon, Italian Job, the illusionist, the Incredible Hulk, Pride and Glory, Stone. Watch them all."
tt0120586,"When I first heard of ""American History X,"" I thought it was going to be ""just another movie."" Man, was I wrong! The first time I watched it, I sat there as it ended, and I was just completely in a state of shock. This movie, more than any other movie I had seen on the subject of racism, really made me think twice about how I treated people of a different race. The way that Derek Vinyard's family was almost completely split apart and destroyed due to his racist beliefs should be a wake-up call to those people who have any racist beliefs whatsoever. I believe that this movie was a whole lot more than just a ground-breaking, controversial drama; it was a portrayal of exactly how much damage can be done to a family and a nation simply because of the hate for a person or people of a different color, for almost no reason at all. The Bible says that ""God created man in his own image."" It also says to, ""Love your neighbor as yourself,"" which, right there, implies that racism is not something people should even consider. I wouldn't recommend that anyone under the age of 16 see this movie due to its graphic content and language; however, I believe that everyone who is over the age of 16, should see this movie at least once. This way, more people will get a chance to see the true consequences of racism, and how it can easily tear apart a family."
tt0120586,"I honestly don't think I have ever seen a better movie than American History X in my entire life! I may only be 14, but I have seen a lot of movies. I am an avid fan of them, and this one just takes the cake. Edward Norton is just unbelievable. He is the most talented actor I've ever laid eyes on. His performance in the movie is phenomenal. He delves so deep into his character that he can convince the whole audience easily of his neo-nazi role. The look on his face as he walks back from killing one man in the first seen is purely horrifying. The entire move was dramatic, intriguing, and powerful. It really is moving and emotional as well as scary. It is so true to life, and provides the viewer with such insight into the life and events that create a monster such as Derek Vinyard. It answers many questions I have long awaited an answer to such as what could possibly make someone act as Derek did in this movie, yet left open-ended many others that people such as myself may have. Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely captivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than if Edward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts. It's bad enough he lost it to Cuba Gooding Jr. when he was in Primal Fear, which was yet another incredible performance by him. Edward Furlong, the little kid from T2 is astounding as the confused brother of Derek. I was stunned walking out of the theater after seeing American History X, and I don't think I will ever have the benefit of seeing another movie as good as this one as long as I live. I recommend anyone with a good tolerance for violent and graphic depictions go see this movie. I am bewildered as to why director Tony Kaye would ever want out of this success. If I were to rate this movie, as I often do for others in reviewing them for school, I would give it an A+ with all of my heart."
tt0120586,"I'm a bit bewildered by the praise heaped upon this film. Ed Norton does a good job and was just coming into his own at this point. His acting was not at the level it is today though. Furlong earned his money but did not shine in his role. Balk utterly failed to rise on this cinematic occasion and Keach showed up for the check. The story, the underlying message and personal transformation of Norton's character should be considered the pillars of this film. I however staunchly disagree with its position at number 61 in the top 250 films. Ponder for a moment that Spartacus is over 100 films below American History X, that alone should give you pause. It would be accurate to say that votes from the younger, more internet savvy, could be held accountable for such an imbalance. Those who felt that Eminem deserved an Oscar for 8 Mile. In both instances the story had a degree of truth and realism but Oscars are for a chosen few. I urge generation x and generation next to take more than a mere cursory look at the fellow top 250. Did Norton deliver the role with the same intensity as Brando? ""Contemplate this on the tree of woe."" James Earl Jones as Thulsa Doom Conan the Barbarian (1982)"
tt0253474,"Man, I can not get this film out of my head. It is so rare that a movie can affect me the way ""The Pianst"" did. The last movie that did that was ""Casino"". I was really tired when I was watching the movie. It was almost midnight, so I was thinking that I'll start watching and I'll finish it in the morning. Did I? No, indeed I did not stop watching. I couldn't stop it. I just wanted to see what would happen next. I cried during ""Schindler's List"", I sobbed in this film. Everything that happens in this film is so sad. Adrien Brody does a remarkable job of acting in this film. I would very highly recommend this film. Especially if you are a history buff. Please, I think this film should be in the top 10 best films of all time.I looked on the message boards you know and some other user comments that didn't enjoy this film much, they criticized Adrien Brody's performance and say that he was boring and only showed emotions that are easy to act. Please, you have got to be kidding me. This man portrayed the total feeling of hopelessness, being alone, being hated. I one time had an audition in high school like this to see if I could improvise, and the way I imagined this feeling is like in dodgeball where you have no one else on your team and you're the only one left standing, yet on the other team there is 20 big men that are just waiting to wack that ball at you. Adrien couldn't have done a better job, I was so frightened for him and cried for him during the whole film while he was one the run.Roman Polanski as the director, he himself escaped the terrors of being a prisoner in The Holocaust, yet he lost his mother and other family members. Yes, I'm sure this film must have been hard to re create for him, but he was probably the only director that could have done this movie as brilliantly as he did. He created this story and made it so effective, I called up my mom and told her that I loved her so much because we take so many things for granted. True, this isn't the 1930's or 40's, and we are in America. But it's still frightening to think that human beings are capable of that much hate and being so brutal to another human. World War II is one of the most frightening wars in history, if you read more about The Holocaust, you get more into it and you should. If you are not interested, then watch this film. It's a must see, otherwise how else will we learn from our mistakes? The Pianist is a beautiful and extremely dark tale about a man and the struggle to survive. The ending is so powerful and moving to know that sometimes one man can make a difference in a crowd of so many and I'm not talking about Adrien Brody's character. You'll see what I mean.10/10"
tt0253474,"This is a truly heart-wrenching story of one man whose family gets perished in the Holocaust and about his survival over solitude, deprivation, starvation and terror while in hiding during the Nazi occupation. In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust. This movie came close to Schindlers list in depicting the horrors of Holocaust. Brody puts in a marvelous and utterly touching performance. The story depicts the emotional and cultural breakdown of persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them. Excellent acting by Brody."
tt0253474,"The Pianist is an account of the true life experience of a Polish pianist during WW2, in the context of the deportation of the Jewish community to the Ghetto of Warsaw, a setting virtually absent from all films inspired on WW2.
Polanski (himself a child survivor of the Krakow and Warsaw ghettos) could have described in more detail the legendary, desperate fighting of the Jewish resistance in the ghetto of Warsaw, or the horrific mass extermination in concentration camps. Instead, the film gains in intensity by displaying the war from the pianist's own point of view (through windows, half-opened doors, holes in the walls - with big emphasis on the use of ""point of view shooting"" by the cameraman). One cannot help feeling disturbed by the most enthralling scenes of the film, as the isolated pianist tries to ensure his survival in the ghetto and ruins of Warsaw, hiding and fleeing, moving from one bombed house to the next, gradually becoming a shadow of his former self, hungry and afraid (merit largely attributed to the extraordinary performance by Adrien Brody, who visibly loses half of his weight throughout the film).Does the pianist raise any sympathy from the audience? Not immediately, in my view. The pianist is more than often a drifting character, almost a witness of other people's and his own horrors. He seems to float and drift along the film like a lost feather, with people quickly appearing and disappearing from his life, some helping generously, others taking advantage of his quiet despair, always maintaining an almost blank, dispassionate demeanour. One may even wonder why we should care in the least about this character. But we do care. That is, I believe, the secret to this film's poetry.In one of the strongest scenes, towards the end, a German officer forces the pianist to play for his life, in an episode that suddenly brings a much lighter, beautifully poetic shade to the film (this German officer will be probably compared to Schindler, although his philanthropy does not quite share the same basis).This is also a wonderful tribute to Polish artists, through Chopin's music, with the concert at the very end of the film and the opening performance by the pianist at the local radio station (with the sound of bomb explosions in the background) forming an harmonious link between the beginning and end of the film (following Polanski's usual story-frame).Overall, The Pianist is one of the most detailed and shocking accounts of the treatment of the Jews by the Nazis, with the atmosphere in Warsaw well captured and believable. Quite possibly, The Pianist will remain in the history of film-making as the most touching and realistic portraits of the holocaust ever made.Polanski's film deserves a strong presence in the 2003 Oscar nominations, including a nomination for Adrien Brody's amazing performance, Polanski's sublime direction, best adapted screenplay and, obviously, best picture. This could be, at last, Polanski's long awaited, triumphal comeback to the high and mighty Hollywood."
tt0253474,"I can remember when this film came out I was adamantly against seeing it. I had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic Jewish Holocaust film where good triumphs over evil and in between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by the Germans to add some flavour.How wrong I was.This is one of the best films I have ever seen and what it did to me I cannot describe in words. But in a nutshell, it moved me, made me cry, made me feel like I was in the Polish ghetto in 1940, and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as I walked out of the theater and thanked God that I live in the free society that I do. Roman Polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby but this is his crowning achievement. I think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years Oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film. I believe that the Oscar's are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else, so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year, it tells you that it should have won best picture but the Weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone, hence a charlatan like Chicago takes top prize. Sorry for the digression here but when you compare a ""film"" like Chicago to a masterpiece like The Pianist, there really is one clear cut winner. They handed out the statue to the wrong movie.The Pianist follows up and coming piano player Wlad Spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos, surviving only by the kindness of strangers. I think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because Spielzman is a man that we can all relate to. He is not a hero, he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. He is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can. Only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide. And this is how I related to him. If put in his position, how would I react? Exactly the way he did. This is a man that had everything taken from him. His livelihood, his family, his freedom and almost his life. There is no time for heroics here. Adrien Brody embodies the spirit of Spielzman and his win at this years Oscars was one of the happiest moments I have had watching the festivities. His speech was even better but that is a topic for another time.Ultimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the German soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes I've witnessed. With very little dialogue, it is in the eyes, the face, the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know. I think it is this scene that won Brody his Oscar. This is one of the all time great performances.I think Polanski spoke from the heart here. He has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other. I think The Pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done, Chicago will be forgotten the way Ordinary People was forgotten and when people talk about the film The Pianist, they will do so with reverence and respect. This is a cinematic masterpiece.10 out of 10"
tt0253474,"The Pianist is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, at the time Poland's most acclaimed pianist whose life is transformed during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw beginning in 1939.  The film spans several years and maps his many personal trials in addition to providing the perspectives of his family, rebel factions and sympathizers.Brilliantly directed by Roman Polanski and starring an amazing Adrien Brody, The Pianist is bound to garner comparisons to Schindler's List, for obvious reasons.  However similar the subject matter, the approach is different. While Schindler's List was filmed in a beautiful, crisp black and white that offered many incredible images, The Pianist was filmed with almost muted color.  Schindler's List featured what has been argued as a complicated hero.  Oskar Schindler did save many Jews, but not without battling his own materialistic demons first.  The Pianist's Szpilman is a sympathetic character throughout.  His plight was desperate, and the demons he fought were over his own guilt in surviving a fight that eventually turns into a primal will to live.Polanski does not spare the viewer any grief with his film.  The horrific scenes between the Nazis and the Warsaw Jews were more terrifying and horrible than any horror/suspense movie I have seen in some time, possibly ever.  The humiliation and complete loss is wrenching.  In several scenes, Jews are lined up in the middle of the night and subjected to either torture or death.  In one case, a woman asks of a Nazi officer, ""What will happen to us?"" and is promptly shot point blank in the head.  The camera does not flinch or subdue any of these atrocities.A mention must be made of Brody's performance.  Having only previously seen Brody in two other films, Spike Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" and Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" (a part that was supposed to be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically) I knew his potential was great.  After his Oscar win, I viewed this movie with more criticism than I normally would have and he certainly did not disappoint.  He transcended my expectations.  His physical transformation was amazing, but more importantly, he conveyed the sorrow of this man shockingly well - in both verbal and non-verbal contexts.  It will be very interesting to see what kind of opportunities this role will afford him, and the kinds of roles he will accept.Something worth mentioning is the affect this movie had on the audience with whom I viewed this film.  Normally, when a film ends, the regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay and watch the credits in their entirety. The rest of the audience stands up and leaves, usually to the chagrin of the remaining enthusiasts.  This was one of the few times I have seen a film at a theater where not one person stood to leave during the final credits. It wasn't until the house lights came up at the end did people begin to disperse.  Personally, I hightailed it out of the theater the second the lights came on because not only was my face a mess from crying during the film (Tammy Faye comes to mind) but I had this overwhelming need for an emotional release, so when I reached my car I sat and wept for about five minutes.  It has been years since I have watched a film that upset me to that extent. Conversely, while discussing this film with my brother, (someone who loves movies as much and has similar tastes as I do) he mentioned that while he thought the movie was excellent, he wasn't as profoundly emotionally effected as I was.  After thinking about this for a couple of days, I realized the difference: The music.  As a classical music enthusiast and erstwhile musician, the thought of not being able to enjoy, much less play the music you love is a tragic one.  Then the emotional outpouring that comes when you return to it - there aren't words to describe how intense that is.  Not having the same appreciation for this musical genre, one will be able to sympathize with the physical and emotional tribulations, but perhaps not in the musical sense.The Pianist was truly an astonishing film.  I was riveted from start to finish and so emotionally affected that I couldn't even consider writing a review until a week later.  Having said that, I am filing this away with my list of movies which include Schindlers List and Philadelphia, as films that I love but cannot rewatch for a long time after due to their intensely emotional content.--Shelly"
tt0253474,"This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways!  It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off.  It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away.  (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there's no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest `safe house' has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head.  Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD's flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was), I'd be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won! (Besides, the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars -- this time it was dark horse Brody's turn! :-)"
tt0253474,"The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects. Roman Polanski's account of the survival of the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him.The only fault one can find with the adaptation of Mr. Szpilman's story by playwright Ronald Harwood, is the fact that we never get to know the real Wladyslaw Szpilman, the man, as some of the comments made to this forum also have indicated.There is a very interesting point raised by the the pianist's father who upon reading something in the paper, comments about how the Americans have forgotten them. Well, not only the Americans, but the rest of the world would not raise a finger to do anything for the people that were being imprisoned and made to live in the confined area of Warsaw. The exterminating camps will come later. What is amazing in the film, is the frankness in which director Polanski portrays the duplicity of some Jews in the ghetto. The fact that Jews were used to control other Jews is mind boggling, but it was a fact, and it's treated here matter of factly. Had this been made by an American director, this aspect would have never surfaced at all. Yet, Mr. Polanski and Mr. Harewood show us that all was not as noble and dignified as some other films have treated this ugly side of war.  Wladyslaw Szpilman, as played by Adrien Brody, is puzzling sometimes, in that we never get to know what's in his mind. He's a man intent in not dying, but he's not a fighter. He accepts the kindness extended to him. He never offers to do anything other than keep on hiding, which is a human instinct. He will never fight side by side with the real heroes of the ghetto uprising. His role is simply to witness the battle from his vantage point in one of the safe houses across the street from where the action takes place.Adrien Brody is an interesting actor to watch. As the pianist of the story he exudes intelligence. There is a scene where Szpilman, in one of the safe houses he is taken, discovers an upright piano. One can see the music in his head and he can't contain himself in moving his fingers outside the closed instrument playing the glorious music from which he can only imagine what it will sound in his mind.The supporting cast is excellent. Frank Findlay, a magnificent English actor is the father of the pianist and Maureen Lipman, another veteran of the stage, plays the mother with refined dignity.In watching this film one can only shudder at the thought of another conflict that is currently brewing in front of our eyes. We wonder if the leaders of the different factions could be made to sit through a showing of The Pianist to make them realize that war is hell."
tt0253474,"Polanski has depicted the gory details of the holocaust without much restraint. But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.Every single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.Overall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.Pawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.Hervé de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.The scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.Great film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars. I will give it a 9 Out of 10."
tt0253474,"The Pianist tells the story of such a man in war time Poland, played by Adrien Brody, who from start to finish sees his life literally getting worse and worse and worse- starts off with new rules from the Nazis, then the stars on the arms, followed by the Warsaw ghetto, and while there he could play in the restaurant, that too soon ended, as the trains arrived and took his family and anyone else he knew away.  During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  This is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).In conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski's best, a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.  Great music too. A+"
tt0253474,"I remember seeing ""Schindler's list"" about ten years ago, and I remember how weird I felt for being almost completely unmoved by it. Although it showed the horrors of holocaust quite realistically, somehow it all seemed just a bit too fake and exaggerated. Characters were a bit off (I still can't decide who was more over the top, Schindler or Goeth), fake sentimentalism was all over the place, . While it was a work of art and an important reminder of true events that shouldn't be forgotten, on emotional level it just somehow failed to deliver.Enter ""The Pianist"". With no Spielberg around to put his trademark sappy material, we finally have a movie that shows the true horror and tragedy of Jewish people in World War II. The story is told through the eyes of one man - Wladislaw Szpielman, Jewish pianist who works in a radio station in Warsaw during the German occupation of Poland. Together with him we watch his world getting torn apart, witness his family being taken away, his existence being reduced to bare essentials. Brody gives a subtle yet spectacular performance, his best work yet. And never once are we reminded that we are watching a movie. Everything is shown from Szpielman's point of view, and it is all very gritty and realistic. While Spielberg's rendition of German atrocities always had a slightly staged feel to augment their dramatic purpose, here they are so true to life there impact is much greater - you watch and are being reminded in horror that this things actually happened.While being very hard to watch sometimes, this is a movie that ""Schindler's List"" was supposed to be. This movie doesn't judge anybody, or tries to explain anything - it shows historical events as a reflection of one man's fate, making a powerful testimony that stays with you long after the beautiful last shot and the end credits are over."
tt0253474,"last weekend, I saw Roman Polanski's The Pianist and what a movie. The grizzly reality feeling of the movie shell-shocked me in the first place but later on I recognized the pure feeling of the film: The horror what war does with innocent people truly is. the main story isn't about a war hero, but about people who don't want to die in this madness. Every aspect of the film is really done for an reason and in his place and you don't feel this as entertainment.the music is what hit me the most. the classical tunes had such an enormous impact on me and portrayed the feelings of the main role of the pianist. The fact that there are no hero's in a war movie is for me more than a welcome benefit. No war in the world should have hero's who can't die. Everybody in this movie can die, every second of it. The scary moments are real scary.
bottom line: ten times as realistic as the also brilliant Schindler's list. and twenty times better than Saving private Ryan for the lack of hero's and there is no patriotism at all.ten out of ten, best movie of 2002"
tt0253474,"This is a well crafted movie that deserves some praise, but I still felt the film is a bit overrated. I guess it's cause I was expecting a phenomenal and amazing movie, but what I got was a pretty good movie. It just wasn't as powerful or compelling as I thought it would be. Adrien Brody was almost perfect for this role, his transition from being a prideful musician to a broken down man was done really well. This film just wasn't all that challenging, the plot is basically based on a true story of Władysław Szpilman(Adrien Brody). And his struggle to survive during the Holocaust. The thing is the whole thing seems a bit conventional a lot of aspect of this movie just seemed to narrow at times and straightforward which isn't necessarily a good thing and lack depth. The film also seemed to drag a bit because of the direction it kept going, it's a good movie and I agree with some of the positive feedback this film has been getting. It just isn't a powerful or amazing film I was looking forward to seeing, not one of those movies I feel I need to see again someday after it's finished. It really isn't a masterpiece like come critics claim it to be.7.8/10"
tt0253474,"If you think that movies that deal with Nazi atrocities are inherently worthwhile, then you might think that this movie is inherently worthwhile. If, on the other hand, you expect a movie, whether it deals with Nazi atrocities or not, to actually tell a story, then I'd say there's a good chance you *won't* find this movie worthwhile.  What does this movie give us? Well, it gives us a string of Nazi atrocities, very realistically depicted, and it gives us what I suppose is supposed to be a main character, but it gives us precious little else!  Most of main character's screen time is given over to him being acted upon by circumstances and by other people, but very little of him being pro-active, himself.  And even his passivity might be interesting if we knew what he was thinking or feeling.  But we are never given that information.  We never know what it is that he really wants.  Or how he feels, say, about the fact that his family was shipped off to their probable death, but he was saved by a fluke.  The picture is certainly well-made from the stand point of art direction and cinematography, but story-wise, it's a shambles.  As far as I'm concerned, Roman Polanski owes me big-time.  Thank you."
tt0253474,"My husband and I decided to watch this on netflix one night as we had heard it was good. Neither of us had any expectations and figured if it won a couple of Oscars it must be decent. I had no idea it was an absolute masterpiece. This may be one of the best movies I have seen to date. Days after I saw this movie I cannot stop visualizing the images and feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. The cinematography is breathtaking. The beauty of pre-devastation Warsaw is sharply contrasted with the bleakness of the ghetto, and it would be understatement to say how haunting the visuals of Warsaw after the bombings were. The acting here is tremendous. Brody (who I had really not seen in anything else significant prior to this) carries the entire movie on his wan shoulders. He conveys so much with pain, anguish, hope, and loss with just his eyes. It is quite the actor who causes the viewer to feel the pain he is experiencing as a character. This was an extremely well deserved acting Oscar.This movie is extremely depressing considering the subject matter but it is told and portrayed with grace and power by Polanski. So many scenes are powerful and haunting. To me, in many ways this is a perfect movie. Yes, I know this review is filled with hyperbole, but I simply cannot remember the last time I was so moved and impressed by a film as I was with the Pianist. See it at least once."
tt0253474,"Everything about this movie is made in perfect detail; the clothes, the buildings etc. The audience gets to see how the Jewish population in Warsaw started out as normal everyday citizens and how the German government slowly brought them to their deaths.
The acting is not over the top it's completely realistic and Adrien Brody is MAGNIFICANT! If you don't shed a tear or get chills watching this true story then you have no soul!"
tt0253474,"Some reviews I've read here, have found this movie too detached, lacking urgency. I believe, that impassive quality reflects exactly what Polanski wants to say this extraordinary jewel.By showing Wladyslaw Szpilman as a survivor but not a fighter or a hero--as a man who does all he can to save himself, but would have died without enormous good luck and some kindness from a few non-Jews--Polanski is reflecting, I believe, his own deepest feelings: that he survived, but need not have, and that his mother died and left a wound that had never properly healed.Adrian Brody's performance was utterly mesmerising. I doubt that we'll see him act like that - EVER.Little wonder he was awarded Best Male Actor at the Oscars.Polanski too was awarded Best Director - ironic Brody was the youngest recipient of an Oscar and Polanski was the oldest until Clint Eastwood won it several years later."
tt0253474,"I knew Roman Polanski's talent but was not prepared to this descent to Hell, described in painstaking detail. I'm physically upset after watching this film. The sense of disgust is real. How awful. How awful.I could not help identifying myself with the Jewish Poles in Varsovia. I couldn't help thinking that the paralytic old man thrown down the window could be my grandfather. Couldn't help thinking that the kid savagely pulled through the wall could be my brother. Couldn't help thinking that the girl asking the SS-guard the wrong question and being killed just for that, could be myself.The film describes beastly destruction of any dignity, and yet the struggle for surviving despite everything, even if rationally you realise that, perhaps, it would be even better to end it all at once. It describes the dishonesty of people profiting of this situation to make business out of your misery. It describes your need of believing the words of men NOT of their word, if they promise you life. And affection and courage surviving despite all this.This film could make a good pair with ""der Untergang"" with Bruno Ganz, which is also such a masterpiece that you may risk feeling sympathetic with the Nazi. Have you had this temptation? Watch ""The Pianist""."
tt0253474,"There have been so many fine films that deal with the Holocaust. Each shows the atrocities of the Germans, their random cruelty, their ruthlessness. This film has all that, but it also has Adrien Brody. This is a film that gets us inside the human being, the person who must run, whose iron will propels him forward. The thing is, though, he is not necessarily a hero in the traditional sense. We sense the fatigue of his character as he runs from situation to situation, just trying to stay alive. There are good people around him, many are good Germans. While we watch people shot in the head, beaten to the ground, mutilated, we see him moving aimlessly toward something (the thing is we don't know what that something is). He hears rumors about the Russians liberating Poland but he can't let up for a second. He watches as the underground makes sacrifice after sacrifice, their building burned, their people sent up in flames. He sees himself as a coward. He thinks about being dead, but his will to live drives him on. The title, of course, is him--the pianist--a nationally known classical pianist, suddenly dehumanized. We see his weaknesses and his strengths. We also get a more balanced though terrifying view of the situation in the Polish ghetto. This is a film we should all see."
tt0253474,"Around 30% of Warsaw's population was Jewish in 1939, about 375,000 people; with refugees, the population of the ghetto rose to 450,000 - over 80,000 perished in it; deportations to Treblinka began in July 1942 (Yad Vashem).I would rather have seen this film in the languages of those it portrays using actors from the countries and regions where these despicable, heinous and unforgivable events took place. It would have made an already immensely powerful reflection even more so."
tt0253474,"`The Pianist' is a bit like `Schindler's List' as seen from the inside out.  The one flaw in that earlier film always seemed to be that, by choosing to make a Gentile  Oskar Schindler - the protagonist in his film, Spielberg turned the Jews themselves almost into background players in their own story.  That doesn't happen with `The Pianist' since the hero in this case happens to be himself a Jew  the real life Polish pianist and composer Wladyslaw Szpilman - who managed, through strength, determination and the assistance of a number of brave and caring individuals, to survive the horrors of that darkest and most inexplicable chapter in 20th Century history.This is not to say that `The Pianist' is a better film than `Schindler's List'  far from it.  For while this latest work from Roman Polanski is a fascinating tale of survival in its own right, the film lacks the moral and psychological resonance that made Spielberg's work such a universally acclaimed masterpiece.  Because Schindler was an outsider looking in, he was forced to make the kind of moral choices that Szpilman never really faces in the situations in which he finds himself.  In fact, the one time that the protagonist is confronted with such an option  having to decide whether or not to betray his people by joining the Jewish police whose job it is maintain order in the Warsaw ghetto  Szpilman flat out declines the offer. This may, indeed, be the way circumstances played themselves out in real life, but this elimination of any kind of psychological depth makes `The Pianist' seem frustratingly superficial at times.Although the film isn't as rich and powerful as it might have been, `The Pianist' is still exceptional on a lot of different levels.  First of all, Polanski and his screenwriter, Ronald Hardwood, both of whom won Oscars for their work here, capture the brutality and sadism of the Nazi regime with frightening candor and almost `reportorial' objectivity.  As in `Schindler's List,' people in this film die in very believable, very graphic ways. Particularly interesting are the early sections of the film in which we witness the gradual steps leading up to the eventual deportation and extermination of the Warsaw Jews, beginning with the curtailment of Jewish civil rights, then to the branding of them with stars of David on their clothing, then to their imprisonment in the Warsaw ghetto, and, finally, to the inexorable walk to the gas chamber.  `The Pianist' doesn't take us that far on screen, but we sure sense the presence of those death camps in the loss of Szpilman's entire family.  `The Pianist' brilliantly recreates this shameful era in recent human history and does so without becoming sentimental and pretentious in the process.  Adrian Brody won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance here, and he is very good indeed, especially given the fact that the role calls for him to be more of a reactor to the events around him than a catalyst.  Polanski and Hardwood have provided this fine young actor with a veritable tour de force assignment that he executes with a great deal of skill and aplomb. Unfortunately, a number of the other characters - particularly those who go out of their way to help him - remain stubbornly enigmatic throughout.`The Pianist' is an honorable addition to the list of fine films that have attempted to come to grips with the subject of the holocaust.  But, for my money, the best still remains `The Shop on Main Street,' the Oscar-winning Best Foreign Language film of 1965.  This superb Czech film does what `The Pianist' is never quite able to do, which is to find a way to involve us in the momentous moral dilemmas that undoubtedly faced many of the people involved in this life-and-death event.  `The Pianist,' by making its tale strictly a story of survival and not a study of human psychology, fails to illuminate much of what we really need to know about that time. And about ourselves."
tt0253474,"I don't know what to say about this move other than it really didn't movie me. Sure Adrian Brody is excellent as the Pianist of the title who hides out in Warsaw as the city is destroyed around him, but I never really connected to the story. I never really cared. I'm not sure if its poor film making or simply the fact that for me this seemed as been there and done that. Many of the things that I dislike in the well financed movies concerning the Holocaust came into play, in particular the fact that everything looks so nice as to be unreal. I also have the sense that the film is insisting that I like and respect it simply because of the subject matter. Its not that simple you have to give me characters and a good story before I care. Unfortunately while Brody is an excellent actor however I never connected to him. I never had a reason to care other than what happened was truly remarkable, which means this movie meant nothing to me. This film is a major disappointment"
tt0054215,"No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in ""10 Rillington Place"" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in ""American Psycho"". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film."
tt0054215,"Getting into Hitchcock's Psycho, 57 years after its original release is like assisting to a masterclass of sorts. We can now identify what made this little lurid tale into a classic. Hitchcock himself, naturally, but now we know the first director's cut was a major disappointment and that Alma Reville - Hitch's wife - took over, re edited and the results have been praised, applauded and studied ever since. Janet Leigh's Marion Crane created a movie landmark with her shower scene. Bernard Herrmann and his strings created an extra character that we recognize as soon as it reappears under any disguise but, what shook me the most now in 2017 is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. His performance has evolved with the passing of time and its effect has remain as chilling, as moving, as funny and as real as it was in 1960. It's interesting to watch Gus Van Sant's 1998 version with Vince Vaugh as Norman Bates. If you look at the film, shot by shot with Berrnard Herrmann's strings - it's pretty fantastic. - Play it in black and white if you can. The problem and it is a monumental problem, we wait for Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, if the casting of Anne Heche was really bad - not a hint of Janet Leigh's humanity, the casting of Vince Vaughn was incomprehensible. Not just not credible for a moment but annoying, very annoying. Anthony Perkins brought something profoundly personal to Norman Bates and as a consequence we connected with his sickness. We felt for him. Okay, sorry, I didn't mean to go there but I felt compelled to because I saw again Psycho (1960) ad Psycho (1998) at 24 hours from each other and realized that the main flaw of the 1998 versions is the absence of Anthony Perkins."
tt0054215,"Robert Bloch wrote the original work, Joseph Stefano adapted it into a tight screenplay but it was Alfred Hitchcock with the extraordinary complicity of Bernard Herrmann who transformed this lurid tale into a classic, horror masterpiece. The score propels us into the moment before the moment arrives provoking the sort of anticipation that verges on the unbearable. The fact that the key scenes have become iconic film moments: copied, imitated, emulated and parodied, have not diminished its impact, not really. The anticipation, underlined by Herrmann's strings, creates a sort of craving for the moment to arrive. That doesn't happen very often. No amount of planning can produce it or re-produce it - otherwise how do you explain the Gus Van Sant version - so, the only possible explanation is an accident, a miraculous film accident and those do happen. Everything falls into place so perfectly that even the things that one may argue are below the smart standard of the film, are needed, the film without every frame is not quite the film. Try to turn away after the climax during Simon Oakland's long explanation. You can't. I couldn't. Partly because you know you'll soon be confronting those eyes, that fly, the car..."
tt0054215,"An opportunity presents that can't be ignored, to escape from a world that's been making you bored, with dollars galore you ride out of town, pestered by a copper, who keeps hanging around; you seek to find shelter, somewhere to hide, the motel of Bates is the one that you've spied, there's a curious fella who's friendly, polite - you pay him for a room, and will stay for a night; after saying goodnight you retire to room, then into the bath for a showery flume, but before you're all clean you get into a lather, as the curtain is shred, by a bit of a slasher.Still a wonderful piece of filmmaking all these years later."
tt0054215,"...from the first time I saw it at age 14 until today whenever I run across it.This is the rare example of a much-ballyhooed film that is truly deserving of all the hype surrounding it. It would have been nice to have experienced the film without any knowledge of the plot twists. Unfortunately, for most viewers, the big surprises are not possible since so many of the scenes are part of our popular culture.There were, however, so many unexpected surprises. The opening scene with Janet Leigh and John Gavin in the hotel room was amazing and (pardon the cliché) so real. Hitchcock and Janet Leigh did a brilliant job of pulling us into Marion Crane's story, that of a woman in love with a divorced man who might as well be married considering his heavy financial obligations that leave him unable to marry in a practical sense even though he can in a legal sense. He doesn't even have a proper home - just a room in the back of the store he owns. Marion is then seemingly set up as the center of the movie as she thinks she has found a solution to her problems - a felonious one. Then the focus is skillfully shifted to the Norman Bates character as the ""protagonist"" victimized by his insane mother (or so it seemed) and then the focus is shifted once again to Marion's sister's search. The movie was adapted from a novel so some of the original audience would have been familiar with the plot of the book. In the novel, Norman Bates was a middle-aged man. I think it was a brilliant stroke to have the Norman of the film as a man in his twenties, a boy who never grew up in a man's body. Anthony Perkins is so identified today with his role of Norman Bates that it was surprising to see how endearingly he played him in the early scenes. And he did one of the best stammers I've ever seen in a movie when he was being questioned by the private detective (Martin Balsam) who is also searching for Marion. I also wasn't expecting to see how protective the local sheriff and his wife were of Norman when they were being questioned about him and his mother. You could tell they didn't want somebody (Norman) whom they thought had been dealt a bad hand to have anymore publicity and scrutiny than he already had.This film is mentioned in the documentary ""Moguls and Movie Stars"" as an example of how films were becoming more like TV as the 60s began - spartan art design and a script that was bold in the amount of sex and violence it had, even if the vast majority is implied. You have to be impressed by the versatility that is Hitchcock. Making movies in England? No problem. Making movies in the American studio system? No problem. Modernizing to deal with the evaporation of the production code? Again, no problem. Weird factoid - for you TCM fans out there Robert Osborne is credited as ""man"" in Psycho, although I don't remember him ever mentioning it. The only person it could possibly be unless he never comes close to having his face on camera is the parson as the sheriff and his wife are exiting church. See what you think."
tt0054215,"What can you say about a film that's been talked about to death? Just this: If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to do so, not because it's a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film, but because it's so fun to watch.Janet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss's obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her all-too-distant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel, where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk's possessive mother, who as her boy explains, ""is not herself today."" I'll say she isn't, and so would Leigh's Marion Crane, who maybe should have put up that ""Do-Not-Disturb"" sign before taking a shower.You can feel the decade literally shifting out of '50s and into '60s with this one. Even the opening shot, where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound, like the decor of the motel, but look at what's going on around it. People dress well, they still wear fedoras and jackets, but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.Most especially, there's Anthony Perkins, who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way, complete with facial tics and half-swallowed words, not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin, who plays Marion's boyfriend in the standard-actor-of-the-day way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word ""falsity"" or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.He shines in bigger scenes, too, like his tense chat with Martin Balsam's boorish but diligent private detective character, Arbogast, who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again, you're always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away, but you find yourself liking him, too, even when he's busy covering up ""Mother's"" misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.If you are sampling the many other comments here, be sure to look up Merwyn Grote's. He makes an interesting, compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for ""Psycho."" Certainly ""Psycho"" looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in black-and-white, not color, but the sets; a ramshackle motel, a mothbally old house, a couple of cheap looking bedrooms, a bathroom in a used-car dealership, are deliberately low class.It's thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element, and move things along with such clinical detachment and low-key technical finesse. Thrilling, too, to realize this is one of his most accomplished products; made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played, and daring enough still to break the rules; indeed, start a whole new ballgame.Is it the best Hitchcock movie? It's definitely one of his best, right up there with ""The 39 Steps"" and ""Strangers On A Train"" and ""Sabotage"" and ""Shadow Of A Doubt."" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with ""The Birds,"" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.Often imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, ""Psycho"" still isn't played out nearly 45 years after it came out. You owe it to yourself to pay a visit to the Bates Motel; Norman has a room ready."
tt0054215,"Yes, everything you've heard is true. The score is a part of pop culture. The domestic conflict is well-known. But nothing shocks like the experience itself.If you have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor. Stop reading thse comments, get up, take a shower, then GO GET THIS MOVIE. Buy it, don't rent. You will not regret it.""Psycho"" is easily the best horror-thriller of all time. Nothing even comes close...maybe ""Les Diaboliques"" (1955) but not really.""Psycho"" has one of the best scripts you'll ever find in a movie. The movie's only shortcoming is that one of the characters seems to have little motivation in the first act of the movie but as the story progresses, you realize that Hitchcock (GENIUS! GENIUS! GENIUS!) in a stroke of genius has done this on purpose, because there is another character whose motivations are even more important. Vitally important. So important that you totally forget about anything else. I was lucky enough to have spent my life wisely avoiding any conversation regarding the plot of this movie until I was able to see it in full. Thank God I did! The movie has arguably the best mid-plot point and climactic twist in thriller history, and certainly the best-directed ending. The last few shots are chilling and leave a lingering horror in the viewer's mind.Just as good as the writing is Hitchcock's direction, which is so outstanding that it defies explanation. Suffice it to say that this movie is probably the best directorial effort by film history's best director. I was fortunate enough to see this movie at a big oldtime movie house during a Hitchcock revival. Janet Leigh, still radiant, spoke before the film and explained how Hitchcock's genius was in his ability to 1) frighten without gore and 2) leave his indelible mark on the movie without overshadowing his actors (like the great Jean Renoir could never do). ""Psycho"" is clearly its own phenomenon, despite all the big-name talent involved.Hitchcock does not disappoint by leaving out his trademark dark humor. His brilliance is in making a climax that is at once both scary and hilarious. When I saw it in the theatre the audience was both gasping in disbelief while falling-on-the-floor laughing.One more thing...Tony Perkins. Janet Leigh got much-deserved accolades for this film, but it is Perkins who gives what remains the single best performance by an actor in a horror movie. He is so understated that his brillance passes you by. He becomes the character. The sheer brillance of the role is evidenced by the ineptitude of the actors in Gus Van Sant's 1998 (dear God make it stop!) shot-for-shot ""remake."" Though the movies are nearly identical, Hitchcock's is superior mostly because of the acting and the atmosphere (some of the creepiness is lost with color). This is made obvious by the initial conversation between Leigh's character and Perkins, a pivotal scene. The brilliance of Perkins in the original shines even brighter when compared with the ruination in the remake even though the words and the shots were exactly the same. The crucial chemistry in this scene lacking in the remake gives everything away and mars our understanding of upcoming events. The fact that Perkins could never escape this role - his star stopped rising star as it had done in the 50s - proves that he played the part perhaps too well.I keep using the word brilliant, but I cannot hide my enthusiasm for this movie. It is wholly unlike the overblown, overbudget, overlong fluff spewing all-too-often out of Hollywood today. ""Psycho"" is simple, well-crafted and just the right length.Eleven-and-a-half out of ten stars."
tt0054215,"When you look up the phrase ""Horror Film"" in the dictionary .. a picture of Janet Leigh screaming in a shower should appear next to it. Undoubtedly, Psycho is the greatest horror film ever made, bar-none. The story is incredible. The acting is near perfection. The cinematography is godly. The soundtrack is perfect. It's hard to find anything wrong with Psycho. Perhaps the only imperfection I can find with Psycho is the inability to stand the test of time. One of the reasons the shower scene has become so notorious is that it's not only filmed to perfection, but because the elements of sexuality and murder are so surreal. In 1960, seeing a nude women being murdered in a shower was something that no-one had experienced yet, and was quite shocking. Nowadays, seeing Jason double-spearing two lovers having sex is nothing uncommon. I envy those who experienced Psycho in 1960 in the theaters .. those experienced the full terror of Psycho.Aside from this though, the movie is flawless. I won't even go into to how incredible the cinematography is. One thing I think people seem to forget about the movie is the incredible soundtrack. Sound is such an important element in movies and Psycho is undaunted when it comes to sound. The only other horror movie that even comes close to using sound with such perfection is Halloween (1978).The movie is perfectly casted as well. Janet Leigh as the beautiful Marion Crane, Vera Miles as the concerned sister, Lila Crane, and of course the unforgettable performance from Anthony Perkins as the eerie yet charismatic Norman Bates.I would recommend this movie to any horror movie film fanatic. I would especially recommend this movie to any horror movie fan not desensitized by Friday The 13th, Nightmare On Elm Street, or Scream .. if such a fan exists."
tt0054215,"As with most very old films, Psycho is unlikely to have the same impact on a modern audience than it had upon its first release. So those who are watching it expecting the 'masterpeice' they are often told it is, prepare to be disappointed. Having said that, if you take Psycho of its pedestal as 'one of the greatest films of all time' (though through a historical perspective and in terms of influence, the title is richly deserved' and watch it treat it for what it is, a psychological horror, than the film remains very enjoyable. The acting performance put on by Anthony Perkins is highly believable and at times chilling and, if you have not been exposed to the shows twists and ending already, they still have the potential to shock and surprise even the most seasoned horror fan. On the subject of horror fans, it is worth a watch on that merit alone or for any fan of cinema, to see the film that has shaped cinema today more than almost any other film"
tt0054215,"""Psycho"" has gone down in Hollywood history as one of the greatest of horror movies, and even if you've never seen it (which I hadn't until today) you still feel a certain connection to the movie just on the basis of its reputation. That in itself can be a problem, because you're expecting a lot when you watch it for the first time. Unfortunately, for me at least, this didn't quite live up to its billing. It was a good movie, Alfred Hitchcock did a good job of directing with a number of what are today recognized as typical ""Hitckcock-ian"" touches, particularly with some very effective camera work, and basically the cast, headed by Anthony Perkins as motel owner Norman Bates and supported by Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam (I would say in that order of importance to the story) did a fine job. Still, I was expecting something more.First, I would call this more of a suspense movie with a touch of slasher movie thrown in than a horror movie, although that's admittedly through a modern lens. There are really only a couple of scenes that were ""horrific"" - one being the famous shower scene and one being the revelation of Norman's mother near the end of the movie. Otherwise you get a mystery - with the end surprise being fairly clearly telegraphed to anyone who was paying attention. The suspense starts with Marion (Leigh) stealing a large sum of money from the real estate agency where she works and running off, eventually coming to the Bates Motel to spend the night. Since the murder in the shower is the classic scene of the movie, you don't expect it to come as early as it does, and you don't expect that so much of the movie is going to revolve around Lila (Miles) and Sam (Gavin) as they search for Marion. Somehow, I expected to see more of Janet Leigh. Still, there is good suspense even if the surprise about Norman's mother is pretty clear from even a mile away.What knocked this down a bit for me, though, wasn't the obvious solution to the mystery. It was the seeming need to offer a very in depth psychological explanation near the end of what Norman was all about. Maybe there was a sense that movie-goers in 1960 would need such an explanation. I found what was virtually a closing soliloquy (and a very long one) by Simon Oakland playing a psychiatrist who's called in to examine Norman to be tedious in the extreme, and largely unnecessary; filled with psycho-babble. Norman could have been explained - if an explanation was felt necessary - much more succinctly.One can't diss this movie. There's really very little wrong with it, except that its reputation makes it very hard for it to live up to when you watch it. Undoubtedly, when watched with late 20th-21st century eyes (well conditioned to the point of being almost oblivious to slasher-type violence) it comes across as a bit dull, frankly. Equally undoubtedly, it didn't come across that way to audiences in 1960. Still, I found it to be a little bit of a letdown compared to what I was expecting of it. (6/10)"
tt0054215,"""Psycho"" was definitely a decent film, no surprise as it was made by the great Hitchcock at the top of his game. But the film was just too predictable and had too many laughs where they were not supposed to be.I mean seriously. I can't speak for the crowds in 1960, but if anyone watches this for the first time today, it's pretty obvious where this entire picture is going after we go to the motel for the first time. The title itself is clue enough (he's a ""psycho"" after all) but really, I can't see anyone not guessing the big 'secret' of this flick way before the ending. The film's main characters are cast superbly. Janet Leigh looks great and sexy, keeping the film from being too boring because she's so beautiful and good on screen. And of course Anthony Perkins does a pretty decent job. He doesn't give the awe-inspiring heart-stopping performance that fans of the flick seem to think he gives, but he is very good indeed.The ingredients of the movie are put together very nicely, with the music and editing utilized for the maximum effect. Hitchcock definitely shows why he's known as such a great talent in these respects, putting it all together beautifully.Unfortunately, the film suffers from too many laughs where they aren't supposed to be. When Norman first indicated he's a little ""psycho,"" it's very funny watching him and his serious face as he gives clues he's such a nut case. With ""Mother,"" whenever ""she"" talks (and yells), it's just too funny not to laugh at it. Even the scene when Norman carries ""Mother"" form her room is funny, as she talks her nonsense as he carries her out with her legs dangling.And the ""shocking"" cellar scene almost plays like a comedy skit nowadays. When ""Mother"" is turned around in the chair, what you see just looks too funny not to laugh, and when Norman comes in, combined with his face, the way he was dressed, and the ""Psycho music"" at full bombast, I couldn't help but crack up for ten minutes at the hilarious combination of all this. Sorry to say, what was supposed to be such a frightening scene, is just too comedic to truly scare anymore.It's unreal to think ""Psycho"" was voted one of the scariest films ever made. Who does this movie actually scare?And the cop at the end, with his long-winded speech that sums up the whole picture (conveniently with the rest of the cast sitting and listening intently), is just too blatantly pandering that you just want to say, ""ok, I think we all get it now!"" You almost expect the cop to turn to the crowd in the theater and say, ""ok, does everyone understand now?"" Even the very last shot of Norman is kind of funny, with the expressions he is making. The skull kind of saves the scene, but still.""Psycho"" is still recommended viewing for any old school movie fan, just to see Hitchcock's work. But the challenge is not to laugh at many certain scenes. The ""Making of"" documentary on the DVD is pretty decent (if not somewhat long winded itself) but the omission of deleted or rare scenes is definitely noticed. Janet Leigh is still very sharp though, and still looks great."
tt0054215,"Most modern-day horror films make the killer to be an absolutely inhuman, grotesque, unimaginable monster in order to scare the audience out of its wits.  Most of the time, however, these stereotypes create a generic murderer a raving, ranting, clearly demented psychopath.  One of the few memorable cinematic killers that does not adhere to these restraints and cliches is, of course, Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, whom manages to effectively cause the audience to recoil without such drek as the aforementioned devices.Anthony Perkins' skillfully crafts his performance as Norman Bates, avoiding a ranting, raving, drooling, murder-happy, manic characterization; instead his performance as Norman is subtle, creepy, cool, and unsettling.  He is brilliant; from his quiet conversations with Marion Crane amidst the stuffed birds, to his weasling wimpiness when confronted by Arbogast, his performance is so exact that it chills the viewer, all without the unnecessary disturbing images prevalent in more modern films (read The Cell, Henry: Portrait of A Serial Killer).Perkin's fine performance, a tight script, and Bernstein's classic score make Psycho a film that is now and will always be remembered as one of the pinnacles of the horror genre."
tt0054215,"Hitchcock was very fortunate to have cast the young Anthony Perkins in the leading role.  At the time there were some other young aspiring actors who might have qualified for the part, namely:  Michael J. Pollard; Jack Nicholson; Bruce Dern, Dean Stockwell, Victor Buono and Dennis Hopper.  However, it's hard for me to imagine anyone other than Perkins playing Norman Bates with complete authenticity, it's seems the role was simply made for him and only him.  Could you possibly imagine anyone other than Nicholson in the role of Randall P. McMurphy in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" or Dennis Hopper as Billy in ""Easy Rider""?  Keep in mind the introverted, insecure Mama's Boy was not really PSYCHOpathic as Hannibal The Cannibal was in ""Silence of the Lambs"" - a cold-blooded killer with no conscience - but rather criminally insane, plagued by schizophrenic delusions and seriously in need of multiple reality-checks.  Anthony Hopkins did a wonderful job as the vicious Hannibal, and also as Corky, the schizo-killer ventriloquist in ""Magic"".  I think he just might have pulled off a convincing Norman, but don't believe he was available back then.  Oh well, so much for speculation...Perkins did a great job."
tt0054215,"I am a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock.  I have seen all of his movies, and think all of them are excellent.  This one, however, is at the top of the food chain.  Psycho is brilliant.  Hitchcock gave this film excellent direction, and the acting was superb.  Especially Anthony Perkins playing the role of Norman Bates.  He always talked so fast, like he was nervous and anxious all the time.  When he talked to Marion Crane about his mother, it gave me chills down my spine.  ""She just...she just goes a little mad sometimes.  We all go a little mad sometimes.""  At that era, I don't think a better person could have delivered that line than Anthony Perkins.  What makes this movie so great is its originality.  Sure, there have been lots of films about ""psychos,"" but this is pretty much the first one.  The script was excellent, the acting was excellent, the direction was excellent, the cinematography was excellent, the music was excellent, the scenery was incredible, especially that dark old house where ""Mother"" lived.  I could just go on and on about what a great movie this is.  My grade: A+"
tt0054215,"This is one of the best movies ever created and Alfred Hitchcock is one of the most intriguing film makers ever to live. (in my opinion) There's just so much to say about this film I hardly know where to start.I first saw this movie about five years ago and wasn't impressed at all. Of course, I was about ten years old at the time. I didn't think that the famous shower scene was anything to frightening and the characters seemed a little boring. A little less than a year ago, I became very interested in the history of the film and not so much of the film itself. I read articles, reviews, anything that I could get my hands on. Then, Psycho was shown on AMC and I immediately thought that it was a masterpiece. Shame on me for not appreciating it sooner.The film as a whole is spectacular, but I like to break it down into little sections. First, I was very surprised and impressed with the actors that played Marion Crane and Norman Bates. Janet Leigh isn't given to much exposure to the film since she is killed off in about the middle of it. I thought that she did a good but not great job. On the other hand, Anthony Perkins blew me away. Both Norman and Anthony are very interesting. Norman's life that is set up and shown to us is so well depicted that I can't imagine anybody else playing the part. All of the characters including Arbogast, Lila, and Sam are so well created. Obviously, the plot is so unique and odd that you can't help but smile at it. A young woman on the run after stealing $40,000, and then accidentally falls into the wrong hands of a psychopath. It's great! The best thing is that nobody has ever done anything quite like it, and they won't be able to because then the magic will be gone. Even though the ever so famous shower scene is said to be one of the most chilling death scenes in history, I think that it may be a little overrated. I love it as much as the next person, but it's not all that scary. Who said it was supposed to be scary? Nobody, I know. But the majority of the Psycho audience gathers it to be very frightening. I do still think that it is one of the greatest and shocking scenes ever. The setting is very well set up as well. The Bates motel and house is so cleverly created that it brings a special atmosphere to the audience. It has something about it that you just can't forget.Finally, that music played throughout the film is one of the most spookiest sounds I have ever heard. Great job to the music composers and to Hitchcock for this scary addition to the movie. I think it's safe to say that everybody has heard of Psycho, but not everyone has seen it. For those of you who still haven't seen this amazing flick, go see it! It's a must see."
tt0054215,"Marion Crane steals $40,000 from her employer, running away from suspicions and her own guilt, she checks into The Bates Motel, a quiet, out of the way establishment, run by Norman Bates.Oh boy, this film is quite something. Hitchcock truly was the master of suspense, but he proves he could do horror to, Psycho is the perfect fusion of Horror and Suspense.What audiences in 1960 must have thought when they say down to watch this for the first time, when you think what had come before, this film truly was a game changer.Pacing is sensational, it doesn't hold up for a second, the suspense element is tremendous, first time viewers are in for several shocks, when the big moments come, they are hammered home.There are several sensational scenes, but that shower sequence, that rates as one of the greatest movie moments of all time.Anthony Perkins delivers a performance which is nothing short of remarkable, he's so soft and gentle initially, but the switch up, is incredible. Why he wasn't Oscar nominated is beyond me.The music, as big a character as Norman Bates himself, even on the opening sequences it's powerful and alarming, but the score that accompanies the killings, talk about hairs standing up on the back of the neck.One of my top ten greatest film of all time.10/10."
tt0054215,"I saw this movie as a teenager when it was first released in the 1960's. The promotional hype for the film ensured you did not have a clue what it was about and people who had seen the movie were asked not to reveal the ending. You went to see it anticipating something scary and thats what you got. Even 30 years later I still remember sitting in a dark theatre with my heart pumping and everyone, and I mean everyone, screaming their lungs out.The movie set a new and very high standard in horror movies which I don't believe has ever been equaled. The characters were great, the direction perfect and the music, which I thought was absolutely fantastic, made this a classic.I still get scared when I see it on TV."
tt0054215,"There is a difference between a serial killer movie and a good movie about a killer. To those sad few who think the movies like Gacy, Ed Gein, and Dahmer are of some quality, please burn those movies and simply watch a good movie about a killer ... PSYCHO! If you want to watch a good story about John Wayne Gacy, I'm sure one on A&E will be on any day now! Watch a documentary if you want the facts, if you would rather watch serial killers for entertainment, at least watch a movie with some quality and one that doesn't live off the infamy of the subjects last name!Check out my more in-depth review on my site timothynoble.com!"
tt0407887,"Nicholson, Damon, and Dicaprio make for an absolute powerhouse trio in this classic film. I have had this on my watch list for quite some time, and although it wasn't as rock solid as I was expecting, it's ending was right up my alley. Aside from the phenomenal acting and the satisfying conclusion, I was only impressed with the simplicity of which a complex double-rat story was told. I never felt lost trying to keep track of who worked for who and who was spying on who, because the filmmakers laid it out so clearly for me."
tt0407887,"When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime. It's not my favorite Scorsese film, that honor belongs to Casino for me. But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well, rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond.Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed, Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime. The film is simple enough, the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello. That was Scorsese's little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day, although his real name was an Italian one.Nicholson's character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area. He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate. I didn't add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life.Getting this man won't be easy because he has a full bag of tricks. One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy, concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division. A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations.But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood. At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side. There are no dummies on either side, the police aren't keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come. Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast. Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts. Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine. Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time. The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese. Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year, he might have been nominated himself if he wasn't up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond.The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson's character is in the film. If you think you know how this film ends, I guarantee you will be wrong. Nicholson's character has survived in many ways, that's all I can say.Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston's atmosphere, as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas. He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time. The cast didn't let Martin down at Oscar time and they won't let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small."
tt0407887,"Now I know that 'The Departed' is based off of the Hong Kong movie 'WuJianDao', but Scorsese really grabs hold of a great story and brings it to the American Screen. My father grew up in Boston and when we walked out of the theater he couldn't stop talking about how authentic the environment and attitude was. Then there's the acting in which the lead actors (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon) not only give stunningly entertaining performances, but you become engulfed in each one's perspective and dilemmas. The smaller roles that of (Baldwin, Walberg, Sheen) are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from 'The Big Lebowski', by this I mean that their screen time is limited but they make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scene they are in, Alec Baldwin especially. The story itself starts off with the basic intro of the players and the setting, but you'll find yourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting back and forth for the good guys and for the bad guys. If you're a Scorsese fan, which I am, I think you will appreciate this film. You can clearly see the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course the music, it's great to hear ""Gimme Shelter"" again, but ""Comfortably Numb"" played in so well. It's another gangster flick from Scorsese, yet this one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agree Scorsese does gangster films the best; so why not let him. Oscar worthy, the acting I certainly hope; this is DiCaprio's best role since 'The Aviator' which was his best role since 'Gangs of New York', am I seeing a pattern here. But my lasting impression wasn't concerned with the politics of the golden statue; my lasting impression was that I had sat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertaining storytelling. Thank you Mr. Scorsese."
tt0407887,"First off, this is an American stylized remake of the Hong Kong hit, Infernal Affairs. I have to give credit to that, a good film. I have seen both Infernal Affairs and The Departed. I personally prefer The Departed, and I think because of one thing: Martin Scorsese. This is the master behind such greats as Taxi Diver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and he's at it again. The film has an all star cast with Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin.The Direction was amazing. (maybe one of the reasons why he won the Oscar for it) I loved how some of the scenes were shot and set up. Especially regarding the Chinatown, and police interrogation scenes, among many others. The film is perfectly set up with intense, suspense scenes while adding in amounts humor at times. It works really well. The script is top notch. (Also Oscar winning) Realistic strong dialogue from scene to scene.Another thing I liked more in The Departed, as opposed to Infernal Affairs, was the acting. DiCaprio really seemed to earn a lot of respect from this role. Here, he takes on the tough guy persona so well. Sure it was known he was a good actor from his Oscar nominated performances in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and The Aviator, but he really takes it to another level here. I can't see anyone else as the character, he fits so perfectly with it. Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg, being Massachusetts natives, also give solid performances, with their natural accents. Nicholson works well in his role, as well. Everyone was extremely solid and everything seemed so real.Set in Boston, The Departed takes in all the Boston like atmosphere. Beautifully shot scenes of the Massachusetts Golden Dome State Capital building is just one part of the landscape. The Dropkick Murphys song ""I'm Shipping up to Boston"" really fits, great use of songs. Scorsese usually works music into his films really well.""Cops or Criminals. When you're facing a loaded gun what's the difference?"" This quote really represents the film."" Matt Damon plays a state officer in the Police, working for the crime boss of the area, Frank Costello (Nicholson). While Damon's character can be described as a ""bad guy,"" he is really misunderstood. As a kid, he is sort of mentored into crime business by Costello while Costello becomes the father figure Damon's character never had. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a young guy, coming from a bad, crime ridden family. He's decides to become a police officer to get away from the crime life he's been surrounded by. Taking all this into account, Captain Queenen (Sheen) and Seargent Dignam (Wahlberg) decide to send DiCaprio's character undercover to find out more about the criminal underworld and Costello. With his family's crime record, he fit's perfectly into the situation. Now you have a highly ranked officer working for bad guy, and an undercover cop in the criminal underworld working for the State Police. From here it's an all out suspenseful thrill ride. Who's who? Who's working for who? Who can you trust? Paranoia threatens everyone. Lies. Betrayal. Sacrifice. How far will you take it? At the heart of this film is character development. We really feel for the characters. We feel like we know them. It's really amazing part of this story and film. Tremendous story telling here.This is one of the most entertaining and suspenseful crime/drama's I have seen in a while. While Infernal Affairs, came first, I think The Departed expands on it in so many ways. Really solid crime/drama. Check both out when you get a chance. It's really worth it. 9/10"
tt0407887,"I have yet to watch a good or a very good Martin Scorsese movie. Every movie I watched is a 10. Also, old Jack Nicholson is as good as young Jack Nicholson."
tt0407887,"Boston Police are trying to bring down Gangland boss Frank Costello, Billy Costigan goes undercover to try and nail him from the inside, but his actions are countered by Colin Sullivan, a criminal who has infiltrated The Police, handing information to Costello.This film doesn't date, as I'm watching it, it is now seventeen years old, and apart from the flip top phones, oxycontin, and the fresh faces of DiCaprio and Damon, it has hardly dated.Intense, fast paced, gritty and violent, it doesn't hold back for one second, I'd place The Departed in my top ten list of greatest films. The action sequences are tremendous, and there's a subtle humour rubbing through it. Even if this film doesn't quite fit into your favourite genre bracket, I suggest you still watch, it's an incredible movie.It's one of those films that gets better with subsequent viewings, you may struggle to put some of the pieces together first time round, knowing what's happening only seems to make it more satisfying.The cast, has there ever been a more incredible cast assembled, it's a tour de force from Jack Nicholson, but Damon, DiCaprio, Winstone, and many more are all fantastic.10/10."
tt0407887,"Please don't make negative comments like some of the aforementioned people have been doing if you haven't seen the film yet! I have seen it, at a press screening last week. Not only is it the best film of the year so far, it marks a return to form for Martin Scorsese, and ranks with the likes of GOODFELLAS as being one of the best in his canon of films.I'm a fan of the Hong Kong film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, upon which this is based. While THE DEPARTED keeps the basic structure of the original, it is very much its own movie, so much so that the screenwriter, William Monahan, didn't even watch the original film while adapting its screenplay, thus enabling him to infuse the script with his, and Scorsese's, respective visions.All the actors are first-rate (yes, even Leo, for all you DiCaprio bashers out there), and turn in some of their best performances to date. THE DEPARTED is sure to garner a host of Oscar nods, if not wins, including (hopefully) Scorsese's long-overdue statuette for Best Director. Plus, with actors like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin playing supporting roles, that says a lot about the quality of the film they signed up for! THE DEPARTED is tough stuff, not for the faint-of-heart. That said, it is a must-see for adult viewers who long for intelligent, gritty stories to grace our movie screens once again."
tt0407887,"He has made good musicals (New York, New York), surreal comedies (After Hours), satires (The King of Comedy) and biopics (The Aviator), but Martin Scorsese has never done better than the times he's dealt with life on the streets and gangsters. Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino (and, to some degree, Taxi Driver) are proof of that. It doesn't seem strange, then, that his finest film in over a decade (Goodfellas was released in 1990) sees him return to that familiar ground. With a few changes.The Departed, based on Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs (2002), is Scorsese's first gangster film not to feature Italian-American criminals. In fact, this film is set in Boston, where the Irish rule. One of these ""godfathers"" is Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the man the State Police want the most. After years of investigation, they're finally getting close, thanks to undercover agent Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio). Because of his family (all Irish, all bad), becoming a member of Costello's crew isn't that difficult. Now all Costigan has to do is report to his superiors, Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), who will pass on the information to Ellerby's (Alec Baldwin) Special Investigations Unit. What they don't know is that Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), the most promising element of said unit, has been on Costello's payroll since he was 12. Soon enough, both cops and crooks become aware of the situation, beginning a manhunt that's gonna make the already fragile Billy even more nervous and Costello increasingly crazier.By moving from Hong Kong to Boston, Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have made the first step in ensuring this film will be quite different from its Chinese inspiration. Another significant factor is the running time: a mere 97 minutes for Infernal Affairs, 150 for The Departed. This is due to new characters (Dignam and Costello's henchman Mr French, played by Ray Winstone, were missing in the original) and subplots, such as the one concerning Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), a psychiatrist who gets emotionally involved with both of the moles. But the most crucial difference is in the depiction of the underworld: whereas IA was stylish without being excessive, Scorsese's vision comprises very colorful language (some insults are so creative one might expect Joe Pesci to show up) and, of course, buckets of blood, the last part of the movie proving to be particularly shocking. None of the scenes ever reach the gross-out level of Casino's head-in-the-vice scene, but in pure Scorsese tradition it remains unflinchingly violent (also notable is the music, perfectly setting the mood, scene after scene, alongside Thelma Schoonmaker's impeccable editing).Amidst these brutal surroundings, the director handles a spot-on cast: Baldwin, Sheen and Wahlberg (the latter finally back on form) make good use of their little screen time, Damon fine-tunes the edgier side he showed in The Talented Mr Ripley and the Bourne movies, and Nicholson, playing the villain again at last, delivers another OTT but classy turn (original choice Robert De Niro would probably have played the part with more calm and subtlety). A special mention is needed for Di Caprio: working with Scorsese for the third consecutive time, he has finally found a way to shake off his Titanic image, thanks to a vulnerable, gripping (and arguably career-best) performance.With its clever plot, excellent acting and expert direction, The Departed is without doubt the year's best film so far. If this really is going to be his last gangster film (he has said so), as well as his last studio-endorsed picture, Scorsese can be proud, given the masterpiece he has given us. If only they gave him the Oscar in return..."
tt0407887,"Definitely the the type of movie that makes it worth going to the theater. Very intense action and violence, twisting plot, lot's of misdirection.The story line is a bit overly whelming at times, this isn't a good movie to watch if you're tired and follow the action, the double crosses and the sometimes confusing who's who of the movie, but if you can just remember the basic characters the minor twists won't be too confusing.While it's certainly not a love story, there is that element, with a bit of a morality play going the whole time.I can't make some of the statements I'd like to make because I really try to avoid spoilers in my reviews, but I'll say that I enjoyed the movie even though had I been in charge it may have ended differently...All that said, if you like a thriller that has some rough and tough violence and a plot with a few twists and turns this film would be one I'd recommend to you."
tt0407887,"Before seeing this, I knew I was in for a treat, given that it's a Scorsese movie, but The Departed was even better than I expected.The acting is outstanding. Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is quite possibly the best performance of his career. Even the people who hate him admit he did a good job. It's turned some haters into fans and my brother who despises him even says he was great. Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson give their best performances since The Talented Mr. Ripley and As Good As It Gets. Mark Wahlberg almost steals the show with the best lines. Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen are good, too.Definitely one of the best films of the 00's. And easily one of the best remakes of all time. It's intense, funny, exciting, suspenseful, superbly acted, violent, has great characters, and has one of the most shocking scenes I've ever seen. And there's not a boring moment in it's two and a half hour running time. The film will most likely be nominated for picture, director and adapted screenplay, and in my opinion, it deserves all three of them. DiCaprio and Wahlberg also deserve nominations.See this as soon as you can."
tt0407887,"Excellent. A great, great movie. I saw it last night at a special screening and must say it was a tour de force. Even though Boston is not really a gritty town Scorsese was able to capture a darker side of the city. Coming from that area, I am always concerned when actors put on the local accent as it tends to be distracting rather than supportive. However, with local pros like Damon and Wahlberg they were able to really grab hold of it and not go overboard... most of the time. The true stand out performance has to go to DiCaprio. He has really come into his since hooking up with Scorsese, having scored a number of original performances all of which have expanded his range. He really snagged onto a deep and tragic character and created something that will hopefully be recognized come awards season. One of my favorite aspects was the friendly hostility the characters had for each other. It is a specific trademark that I have never noticed in any other city. In Boston, when you are really close with someone (or not really) it is, more or less, a requirement to bust their balls and shoot cruel insults back and forth in rhythmic banter. That detail was extensively realized in THE DEPARTED and I doubt anybody who was raised outside of the metro Boston area, or at least visited at some point, would find it nearly as hilarious as those who were. As for Scorsese's direction, I think he scored big with this one. While many have criticized that his movies have become more commercial I believe that he has just evolved. There were some classic Scorsese moments here, my favorite being a scene where DiCaprio is alone and packing his things in his apartment. Beautifully cut and stylistically directed. Is it his best effort? No. But it still is truly mesmerizing. He has created something truly special from a city that is highly underrated."
tt0407887,"The DepartedThe screenplay: Top NotchThe performances: all-star cast delivering all-star performancesThe music: perfectThe Directing: Martin Scorsese at his finest and that is saying something.Once again Scorsese delivers a film that meets or exceeds the expectations of its audience in nearly every way. There are moments of incredible tension, violence, and drama, moments where characters reveal their vulnerabilities and weakness. Comedic moments and moments of sadness and through it all a multi layered and brilliant story is told by an American film maker who once again proves Harvey Keitel correct when he said, ""Maybe he (Scorsese) got what he deserves--exclusion from the mediocre."" This film is Scorsese's finest work since Raging Bull, but it is not simply about Martin Scorsese or the amazing screen play by William Monahan, it is more than an amazing score, and great cinematography. While many of the accolades for this film belong to those behind the scenes people who envisioned and directed this film. One would be remiss to not point out the great performances of an all-star cast, many of whom deliver the finest performances of long and storied careers. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon deliver incredible performances. However the performance that stood out for me was Wahlberg, Mark Wahlberg's Sgt. Dignam stole every scene he was in, and he shared screen time with each of the afore mentioned actors. He gets to deliver some of the best lines, and with every scene he leaves the audience wanting more, and anticipating his next scene.Since The Academy has had its collective heads stuck  for so long, mentioning a Scorsese picture and Oscar in the same sentence seems to be a waste of time. That being said I can not say if he will finally win the Oscar that he has deserved for so long, as his major competition (Flags of our Fathers) has yet to be released, I will say that I expect to see Wahlberg nominated for best supporting, and Leo and Damon will be pitted against one another once more, this time for best actor, Monahan will be nominated for writing, and of course Scorsese will be nominated for director. Also, it goes without saying a best picture nomination will be in order for The Departed.That was the long version; the short version is if you like a movie with incredible performances, direction, music and visuals. If you like a layered story that is not formulaic, in short if you appreciate film making and story telling at its finest then see this film. Even with the glowing reviews of myself and others, and the high expectations they will undoubtedly bring I assure you that you will not be disappointed."
tt0407887,The plot line of this film you could almost say is a Shakespearean tragedy. Beautifully written with surprise reveals. Casted perfectly and Howard Shore's score works great to bridge together the scenes. It's honestly as high of a 10/10 as you can get.
tt0407887,"I got to see a sneak preview of it, and I must say: the BEST film of the year so far. Scorcese is at his best and truly deserves his anticipated first Oscar for this film. Also notable are the performances of Matt Damon (such a great ""bad-guy;"" he really must do stuff like this more often), Leo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson (as always), and Mark Wahlberg (best since Rockstar). However, some in the theater with me who had seen Infernal Affairs did say that Departed did not live up to the original. I have yet to see Affairs, but I honestly believe that Departed was pulled off well enough to really bring in some respectable awards in the upcoming season."
tt0148668,"Comedy is merely the hook on which Bill Hicks hangs a series of biting observations about subjects such as drugs and war and government.No cosy anecdotes about the colour of navel fluff to be found here. The high shock factor and skilled delivery almost disguise one of the most nakedly emotional performers of the last 20 years. Because of the depth and resonance of the material this is one of those rarities: a stand up performance that bears repeated viewings.Relentless by name, Relentless by nature."
tt0148668,"Apparently the DVD version of Bill Hicks's comedy special Relentless- filmed from the Montreal comedy special where he finally broke out as a stand-up star- is not quite complete. It runs an hour, and is missing some footage. Luckily, there's enough that remains, and in mostly good enough condition, to suffice calling it an exceptional effort. With maybe one or two little moments where he lags, this is some of Hicks' most flawless work, as usual ranging from cigarette/non-cigarette fatalities, supporting the war but not the troops, playing music backwards (""You're Satan!""), BJ's, and of course drugs. Every bit is stinging with some kind of savagery, witty and with the right targets but never too mean (well, unless you're New Kids on the Block), and even giving a jab at Canadians as it is, of course, Montreal. But the delivery, too, comes sometimes out of left field, a little calm and subtle but with a kind of right sucker-punch that manages to really work the crowd well; just wait till he gets to the stuff about Alabama and you'll start rolling on the floor. It's brilliant stuff. 9.5/10"
tt0148668,"I try to avoid the Denis Leary/Bill Hicks ""taking sides"" stance, because no one knows for sure what was stolen, who might have stolen what, and so on and so forth. Evidence has been put forward for both parties - I try to focus on their individual acts and not let the controversy over who's the real ""genius"" ruin their performances. Everyone steals from everyone - in the end, it's who did it best that matters.Hicks was very funny. Misunderstood in his lifetime - and understandably so - but his death has given him a more legendary status amongst comedy aficionandos. In this classic performance from '92, Hicks rants about everything - politics, smoking, abortion, music, life, death, sex - and hits some really funny stuff.Unfortunately, in my own opinion his actual delivery is not as funny as some other comedians. Hicks went for the throat - and sometimes he went too far. He was a great comedian, but I think a few more years would have helped him perfect the actual delivery of his jokes, because as you can hear in this recording, he often pauses or messes up his jokes (presumably because he forgets the next line).If you enjoy comedy, this is a must-have. It's one of Hicks' classic performances and a classic performance by any standard, really."
tt0148668,"I watched a stand-up show from Bill Maher the other day and made comment on the fact that when he pushes to a delivery of ""outrage"" or anger"" he seemed to lose his point and just ended up hammering the audience with a rant rather than becoming more passionate and convincing. I didn't know it when I wrote that sentence the other night but essentially what I meant was ""he's no Bill Hicks"". I have recently been making an effort to catch up on the man whose name is still spoken with reverence in the stand-up world and it is easy to see why because he manages to produce politically-aware, anger comedy that does not rely on him just ranting or shouting.Of course he does shout and ""go off on one"" regularly but what he doesn't do is make less sense as a result and indeed the energy and anger he comes over with feels real and natural as opposed to some comedians who come over more like they are trying to fire up their audience by being extreme. In Relentless he covers subjects from smoking to celebrities advertising products and throughout he is consistently thoughtful but also funny. Now I am not saying that he excels at both, because I don't think he is wildly hilarious or incredibly wise or correct in all he says but just that in terms of getting the mix just right, he is spot on. A lot of this is from the writing but his delivery is good as he plays his arguments really well to both make his point and draw laughs at the same time.The structure of his delivery is also important because, although extreme, he mostly manages to draw the audience in and see things from his point of view (""mostly"" I said). This is again something to his credit because with many extreme political comedians (again, like Mayer) they tend to only play well to home crowds and are not good enough to ""discuss"" opinions as they get to their point. Here, Hicks does that well in the most part and only occasionally does he appear to throw an extreme opinion out of nowhere (and when he does, at least it tends to be funny).Relentless is worth checking out and it is significant that, even so many years later it still feels relevant and fresh in most areas - something that similar comedians cannot often manage. Not the funniest comedy you'll ever hear, nor the most insightful commentary either but what Hicks did do very well was blend the two so they both work at the same high level and Relentless is a good example of why his name lives on long after his death."
tt0148668,"A stand-up comedy show by Bill Hicks recorded live in Montreal, Canada.A stand-up comedy classic. Bill Hicks is at his irreverent, subversive, cynical best here with subjects and ideas that are often incredibly left-field. Nothing is off-limits, making for hysterically funny takes on things.Many of the jokes are grounded in defiance and calling out the absurdity of modern events and practices, making them even more telling.Some of the jokes here are so fantastic they have come legend. I recognised jokes that I heard in isolation in the 1990s and only now realised that it was Bill Hicks delivering them.Outstanding."
tt0148668,"Bill Hicks is considered a comic genius and one of the greatest comedians of all time. He's SO overrated. Sure, the guy was intelligent, and he had some important and insightful things to say, but none of it is in a comedy friendly format. He's more like a stand-up motivational speaker/commentator that thinks he's funny. He literally shoved the mic in his mouth in one of his specials yelling into it causing the mic to spike and sound painfully obnoxious. I can't stand his stupid monkey faces where he always just sticks his bottom lip out He's simply not funny. Another thing, he drags on his specials with unfunny material and laughs at his own jokes. People need to get there head out of his ass. There, I said it. People are going to say, "" Oh, you just don't get Bill Hicks,"" No, ""I GET"" Bill Hicks, and its awful.George Carlin, Doug Stanhope, Richard Pryor, Louis CK, Bill Cosby, Sam Kinison, Woody Allen....all great stand-up comics...Bill Hicks shouldn't even be in the same breath as these guys!I really wanted to like Bill Hicks, I watched all of his specials for free on you tube, and it was a huge waste of time. I get the appeal for some people, but he was just a bad comedian. He also came off like a pretentious douche who thought he had all the answers. Nothing but a flash in the pan.Final note: George Carlin and Louis CK: 10 out of 10. Bill Hicks: 2 out of 10"
tt0148668,"I searched Google for ""best comedy specials of all time"" and this one was #2. For reference, Dave Chappelle's Killin' Them Softly was #1 (and that's a well-deserved rating). So, I was excited to watch this.But, it was awful. Just really, really bad. The guy makes these stupid faces and laughs at his own terrible jokes. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. I wish I could get the time I wasted watching this, back. I would go get a root canal, instead."
tt1424432,"Seventeen years after the passing of one of the greatest Formula 1 racing drivers of all time a documentary has been released that examines his ten-year career in the sport. Directed by Asif Kapadia ('Far North,' 'The Warrior') and produced by Universal and Working Title, 'Senna' shows the audience the untapped potential and brilliance of the Formula 1 driver Ayrton Senna, while also examining the rise of this shy, young Brazillian boy; from go-karting circuits to a televisual audience of millions. 'Senna' is as moving and touching, as it is interesting and captivating.Born Ayrton Senna da Silva to wealthy middle-class parents in the Santana district of Sao Paulo, he always had a dream of becoming a racing driver and began by driving in the Karting World Championships until he was approached to join Formula 3 for the 1983 season and then Formula 1 for the following season. From his first controversial podium finish in the Monaco in Grand Prix in 1984, two things were born; an intense rivalry with the future French Formula 1 champion (and soon to be team-mate) Alain Prost and a desire to race, dominate and win which would see Senna not only claim three World Championships, but also lose his own life on the track.Where Kapadia's 'Senna' documentary works is in its ability to appeal to wide array of audience members. For the fans of the Formula 1 racing there is a copious amount of footage documenting select races and the events taking place around his career. Rather than use cutaway segments to show various celebrities and sports men and women discuss their memories and recollections of Senna, Kapadia instead utilises a voice-over to accompany the archive images on-screen. By allowing the voice-over of the various people associated with Senna (most notable this consists of McLaren's team principal Ron Dennis, his mother, father and sister, F1 team Doctor Sid Watkins, and Brazilian commentator Reginaldo Leme) to supplement the footage, it both preserves he power of the on-screen image and provides the audience with additional information regarding the situation or event that is being presented.While for the casual viewer who may only know of Ayrton Senna in passing, there is the psychological unravelling of a man trapped in a boy's body. Senna is shown not to be ignorant of the politics of Formula 1, but simply uninterested, he was always that middle-class boy from Brazil who only wanted to race, win and repeat. There is also an interesting inclusion of footage of Senna as a modern hero of the Brazilian people, he's shown as the racing driver who transcended the social and political problems of a nation on the edge of poverty and economic instability and provided them with ray of light and joy that was unfortunately extinguished on the 1st of May 1994. 'Senna' is a brilliant and moving examination of a rising sporting star caught up in the whirlwind of politics, rivalries and stardom, when all he wanted to do was race and win by any means necessary, not for the adulation of millions, but his love for sport so close to his heart."
tt1424432,"I have just returned home from watching ""Senna"" and am struggling to recall a time I have ever been moved by a piece of film so much.What has been created is much more than just a documentary, it charts Ayrton's F1 career and gives the viewer an insight into the man, not just the public face we saw and loved so dearly on the TV. As a F1 fan I could be biased, but I believe this film will appeal to any film lover, it creates a sense of connection and understanding of the man, and unashamedly tears at your heart when the inevitable scene is played out, even though I knew it was coming I was fighting tears in the cinema, it brought back memories from all those years ago.It is some feat though for a film to leave you with such an overwhelming sense of optimism despite the tragedy, but nevertheless Asif has done this in my opinion, as Ayrton's humanity and personality are explored, as is the influence that this one man had on his homeland.I can't recommend this enough for motorsport fans, and anyone who loves film."
tt1424432,"I had been a Fan of Ayrton when I was a child. I distinctly remember watching the F1 highlights with my dad. My dad was a seasonal fanatic of sports and kept updating me with the news from the papers/sports magazines and the television. To relive the moments of Ayrton (the idol) in this emotionally gripping documentary was unbelievably comforting. The script and flow of the events were so flawlessly presented taking one's memory into the Time travel of decade gone by. It was nothing short of Excellence in execution. The documentary dissects Ayton's persona in a subtle way, making it the most compelling Biography of all times. The back-ground score by Antonio Pinto was Enthralling and Sensual delight. This is not to be missed, sad that I had been to the cinema only on the final day when it was shown-much regret the delay. Nevertheless, Its a true Masterpiece which portrays the subtle sadness of a legend's demise in a sweet throat stifling moments."
tt1424432,"This documentary is flawless, it's narrative perfect, it's thrilling, I could not imagine another way of depicting this awesome history. The soundtrack is great, the documentary flows in such a wonderful way, real drama, marvelous histories, some funny parts as well, it's life in it's beauty and it's true form.We get to know so many things about the formula 1 politics and internal struggles at that period.Memorable sentences from the documentary: Senna: -¨Formula 1 is too much money, too much politics¨Jean-Marie Balestre (FIA ex-President): -¨The best decision is my decision¨It's so exciting to see the rivalry between Alain Prost and Senna, possibly one of the greatest duels on the history of sports. There are few movies/documentaries that I would give a ¨11¨ out of 10 and this is one, together with amazing documentary Bus 174, from José Padilha (the director of Elite Squad).A documentary is good when is true to reality, and is awesome when is great to watch as ¨Senna¨ is, a perfect tribute to such a hero. The history of Senna is so inspiring, he is a true champion by all means, as a professional, and as a human being, that's way this is for sure a ""must see movie""."
tt1424432,"Throughout the movie, you start to see how Senna is much more than a racing driver. senna's passion for his country and his fans are second to none. The movies well balanced makes. for a truly entertaining movie. The sadness surrounding senna's is subtle and delicatly done. Nobody comes out bad in this movie. The director has not used any cgi or any reconstructions. The material is completely archived and well put together. The movie won an award last year for documentary of the year, which is truly deserved. On the big screen the onboard cameras add tension and gives a true sensation of speed. I love this film as it suits all f1 and none f1 fans. Senna was loved and ,admired all over the world. This is evident as the movie progresses. Truly magnificent film and well worth seeing. All thats for me to say is go see it.... ENJOY!!!"
tt1424432,"People could be forgiven for not remembering Ayrton Senna De'Silva. Almost 20 years after his death, the true intricacies that embroiled his career and personal life have yet to be unraveled, however this movie does a hell of a job connecting the two in perfect harmony. A bitter sweet taste is left in the mouth of the viewer as they watch a film with subtle undertones of competitiveness and strong hues of emotion. A soulful film, you really find yourself unraveling the charisma and Jues De Vivre that is Senna. From the offset of the movie you find yourself in a somewhat cheerful, unknowing state, as it lightly unravels his early career in Formula 1, whilst hinting at the precursors that led him there. The hard, pressing, and very tight competition of him against Proust is another aspect that the viewer will find to be nail biting, as you truly begin to see the emotional aspect of Senna open at this point. Thus, the ending could come to a heartbreak to someone who had never heard of Senna. But alas, the legacy that lasts, transcends all documentaries, and all books. For the truly afflicted car/racing fan such as myself, you feel torn, and yet very motivated to be the best you can be. To the regular viewer, you feel emotionally attached to a man who affected the lives of millions positively in his home country of Brazil. A perfect mix of a movie, in which you can watch as either an auto-racing fan, or someone who has never heard of Senna; It delivers on a highly emotional level, surrounding you in the warmth that he brought to many."
tt1424432,"As a very keen motor racing fan who saw most of A. Senna's F1 races, (including the race where his car crashed at Imola as a result of a serious mechanical failure), I thought the film was very understated and did not do sufficient justice to one of the most outstanding motor racing drivers of the post WW2 era. I have seen the DVD with the narrated commentary by the makers of the film. It explains why they chose the scenes they did and offers a great deal of explanation of events but none of this information was included in the film. It assumed audiences already knew quite a bit about this man.The problems with the movie included:1. Very minimal narration which left audiences trying to grasp what was really happening at times and lost the opportunity to tell the audience a much richer and more complete story.2. An appearance in the film that he jumped from go-cart racing straight into F1. No one does that and he didn't either. He was driving Formula Fords and then Formula 3 cars successfully over a period of 3 years before progressing to F1.2. Very, very poor descriptions of the man's amazing results in just 10 full years in F1 including 4 of those years in second rate cars. (see below).3. Poor reflections of just how he managed - by pure talent - to consistently out drive his competitors so convincingly with only minimal evidence of just how talented he was. There was no reason why the film should have been limited to only 100 minutes when another 10 minutes of footage could have shown and added so much more.4. Insufficient descriptions of just how committed he was to the safety and well being of other drivers. During the end credits you see a film of a driver stop and jump out of his car during practice and put his own life in danger to sprint back down the track (in the face of other cars) to the aid of another driver that had crashed and was sitting injured in his car across the track. This should have been part of the movie, explained and highlighted because it showed what a magnificent human being that driver was. It was Senna of course. They don't make them like that anymore - at least not in F1.5. There were massive investigations following the Senna crash at Imola, not to mention court cases but none of this was mentioned in the film. It was clearly established that a major mechanical failure in the car (steering column) had caused the crash leaving Senna a passenger in a car racing at 330 km per hour. None of this was covered in the film (other than one minor speculative comment) leaving audiences (who did not know) wondering what had really gone wrong.I could go on but I won't. The film underwhelmed me and is found wanting. It could have been just so much better and so much more emotional and heart breaking. A great deal of improvement could have been made with much more factual narration which would not have even added to run time. The man's achievements at death were amazing but these were never shown to the audience. Here they are and the list is indicative of what a great race driver and champion this guy was:A. Senna held and in most of cases below still holds the following Formula One records: Most wins leading the entire race... 19 Most consecutive pole positions... 8 consecutive pole positionsMost consecutive starts from front row... 24 Most consecutive wins at the same Grand Prix... 5 wins in a row at the Monaco Grand Prix (1989 Monaco Grand Prix–1993 Monaco Grand Prix) Most consecutive pole positions at the same Grand Prix... 7 pole positions in a row at the San Marino Grand Prix (1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991)Most pole positions at the same Grand Prix... 8 pole positions at the San Marino Grand Prix (1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1994)Starts from front row in every race of a season... 16 out of 16 front row starts in 1989Most seasons leading the pole-position statistics... 6 (in 1985,1986, 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991)A. Senna also held the following records at the time of his death:Most pole positions... 65Most laps led ...2,982 -Longest distance led... 13,672 km Most GPs led... 86 Most Doubles (pole and win, same GP race)... 29Most Front Row starts... 87 Youngest triple world champion... 31 years,227 days Youngest driver to score a Grand Slam (pole, win, fastest lap, led every lap) ...25 years, 31 days"
tt1424432,"A must see for formula 1 and motor-sport fans. Formula 1 used to be different from what we see today and, in addition to this unique insight into Ayrton's life, it also brings a lot of F1's skeletons out of the closet.I have never watched a documentary so moving. Right from the brilliant on-board footage of the racing cars to very real narrative by Ayrton himself.Brilliant work. The entire film is made with archived footage, most of which is very rare. The filmmakers do a great job of bringing some of the key characters in F1, and in Ayrton's personal life to the forefront."
tt1424432,"I was born and raised in Brazil. Although I'm not a big sports fan (not even soccer!), something I always get made fun of for, I remember vividly the 1st of May, 1994, the day Ayrton Senna died; even though I was only 6 years old. He was indeed a national hero, whether you cared for Formula One or not. This is a solid, often fascinating documentary about a man's passion; in Senna's case, racing for the win. He won the F1 World Championship three times. His tragic death brings to mind the protagonists of Darren Aronofsky's two latest films: Randy ""The Ram"" (Mickey Rourke) in ""The Wrestler"" (2008), and Nina Sayers (an Oscar-winning Natalie Portman) in ""Black Swan"" (2010). Still, I wouldn't call this a story about the search for ""perfection."" Senna's main appeal is its emotional journey. Brazil is a land of so many paradoxes, and so are its people. At the same time we can laugh at our own adversities (poverty, bad politics, crime history, etc.) by seeing the best of everything; Brazilians tend to inherently suffer from low self-esteem and disguised hopelessness which is only defeated at moments of national heroism, often in sports (Pele in soccer, for instance). I'm not saying Senna was a martyr of any sort. I believe he deserved to be called a national hero because of his talent, passion, and the way he entertained and made an entire nation proud. I never personally cared for Formula One, but I still remember the (sometimes annoying, but always nostalgic) friction noise of the racing cars we all saw on TV every Sunday morning. And the victory song that Brazilians will always associate with Senna. This film brings both elements (alongside some great footage) to introduce all these facets of Senna to a larger audience; and for others, like me, to celebrate the life of a true national hero."
tt1424432,"First off, I have to say I'm an F1 fan, so take whatever You want from that. Senna has to be the best documentary ever made, It simply tells the story of the great man trough, Mostly. old TV footage. This brings back memory s of late night highlight shows of a race that happened hours before. Its Shocking to see the total unfairness of the sport at that time, Its trilling to see the racing. Its so sad to see senna's Last lap at Imola. Overall It's a peek into the life of one of the worlds greatest sportsmen, a wort's and all account of a good, but sometimes, flawed man. If for no other reason than seeing how well the old footage is spliced back together, Go and see Senna, You will not be disappointed."
tt1424432,"The finest film I've ever seen about Formula One, let alone about the genius of Ayrton.Riveting from the first, this makes you feel like you know the man - both the good and the bad. You see him with his family and his fellow drivers. you hear him talk about what drives him, and what makes him go that one step further than anyone else was brave enough (or good enough?) to take. The staggering events of the fateful weekend are shown simply and quietly. A fitting way to show a loss that affected millions around the world. Watch it. It's magnificent, beautiful, painful, and inspiring."
tt1424432,"For me, this was an extremely emotional film. At the age of 10, Senna was my idol, and I was fortunate enough to be there to see him take his final victory. Reliving those moments on the big screen was a truly exhilarating (and tear-jerking) experience.I have consumed volumes of Senna-related material over the years, so to say that this film adds something substantive means a lot. Of course, the stories themselves won't be new to a lot of motor racing fans, but there is something delicious and comforting in the retelling of a beautiful fable. And the film makers are to be congratulated for paring a complex story down to its dramatic essentials, while maintaining the necessary context and without reducing it to a Hollywood narrative. They certainly did a much better job of conveying what Senna was to my girlfriend than I could ever do. The fact that she thoroughly enjoyed the film - and came out of it with a good understanding of many of the nuances of Senna's life - despite being ardently anti-racing speaks volumes.If I have any criticism, it is the lack of audio/visual sync up in many of the onboard shots. And in one shot there are audible gear changes when Senna is supposedly stuck in sixth gear. For the casual viewer these count for little, but for a racing connoisseur these mistakes are like nails on a chalkboard. It's hard to believe that the film was previewed by anyone with a deep understanding of motor sport. One could also criticize the film for telling only one side of a complex history (Senna's), but given the film's scope that is no fault at all in my opinion.All in all, this is a beautiful documentary. It is well-paced, with a perfect running time and wonderful score. I highly recommend it, to racing fans and film fans alike."
tt1424432,"It's true you know, you really don't have to be a fan of Motor Racing to enjoy, be fascinated by or touched by Senna. Much like Julian Temple's Sex Pistols music documentary encompassed the climate of the times, looked at the press and public reactions to something making waves in the entertainment world, so too Senna is dealing with more than a big name racing driver who tragically lost his life at Imola racing circuit in 1994. Director Asif Kapadi and his team have constructed an in depth and poignant picture that follows Ayrton Senna of Brazil from his humble Karting beginnings, right up to that fateful day on 1st May 94 when a country as one sank to its knees in mourning for the man who was their one joy in a country full of hurt and political confusion.Ayrton was a genius in the rain.On the driving/racing side the fascination comes from learning how Senna pushed himself to greatness, a very driven man who was never shy in coming forward. He challenged authority when needed and his on going career spat with Alain Prost often made the news for the wrong reasons, these are insightful and excellent splinters of the film. Incredible feats achieved in the car, like how he finally achieved one of his greatest ambitions, and won the Brazillian Grand Prix with a broken gear box stuck in 6th gear! Things he did seemed like magic to his millions of fans, very religious he felt very close to God, some of his driving had the air of a deity about it! Of course it's all building towards the tragedy, where it hits hard and even there there's a mysticism about proceedings. Foreboding warnings that came when Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger was killed the day before Senna, the Brazillian's reaction unerringly prophetic.He would take the car beyond its design capabilities.It's not warts and all, Kapadi has said that the Senna family oversaw production and much of the maverick driver's persona has been smoothed over. It's also worth mentioning that it's no rags to riches story, Senna was no Slumdog about to become a Millionaire. But this is real, a real man with a real interesting story, a story strung together with real clips and real home footage, not some hack job where a number of people from the same field share their own thoughts on a star that no longer shines. The Blu-ray release offers both an extended cut and the theatrical release, the former contains an extra hour but nothing of significance is gained. That cut is probably more for die hard F1 fans. At 1hr 45m the theatrical cut does an exceptional job by always being compelling with not a dull moment in sight. Quite simply this is one of the best sports person documentaries out there. 9/10"
tt1424432,"I think I started watching Formula 1 around the mid-90's whenever Hill, Hakkinen, Schumacher and Colutard were the big names and I think I stopped as those names started to retire from the sport, so my window of interest was pretty limited and my base of knowledge about the sport was even more so. Senna was only ever a name to me rather than someone I had followed and, although I knew he was a great driver and had tragically died, that was about the end of it and it was the critical praise for this film that brought me to it rather than a specific interest in him or his story. So it is to the film's credit that I was engaged throughout and thought that the story was very well told using only archive footage.The film is a documentary but rather than filming talking heads relating the events, the film uses archive footage to play out the story as if it had been filmed. Of course the end is known and there is a lot of talking in the past tense but the film delivers a story rather than a reflection. Technically it is very impressive and must have taken ages to go through all the old footage, but the media coverage of the period has allowed this film to pick the footage that they would have chosen to film if they had to make it from scratch. We get the good side of his character, we get the conflict, the controversy and of course a sense of how great he was – all of it is delivered via the footage and makes for a great story. The ending being known doesn't really damage how this story plays out because, if anything, it is well used to add significance to some of the footage that comes before and indeed does give the film a tragic air that is effective and adds to how involving it is.Senna is a great documentary and it will not only work for those with an interest in the sport or the person, it is such a well-delivered story that it will also engage those with a passing interest. The selection and use of the footage is really well done to play it out and the film benefits from not visually jumping forward in time by using filmed contributions looking back. A tragic story but a really engaging and well-told one."
tt1424432,"Senna is often remembered as the greatest racing driver of all times, not only in Formula1 but in Motorsports. However, not a lot of people know about his life or even his racing, which ended in 1994. These days, one would just look at his records and/or some YouTube footage of his races to gain an insight on the man. Even I belong in this category. I never got to see any of Senna's race on TV. I looked at his records and never understood why he was often called the greatest racing driver who ever lived. Well, now I do. This movie shows why he is one of the greatest racing drivers of all times. This is a beautiful movie. It is mostly a documentary and consists of a lot of racing footage and interviews by Senna and several other people in F1 during his time. There is good amount soundtrack throughout it though which gives it more of a movie feel than a documentary. It is also the best documentary I have ever watched. The more you watch it, the more you gain perspective towards life of a man who was truly a legend. Don't dismiss this even if you are not into F1 or Motorsports. I think the beginning 20 minutes maybe hard to follow for someone who isn't into racing but it's mostly the event in Senna's life, his attitude and his intensity that make this documentary so interesting. The movie is very intense and almost left me in tears at the end (rarely happens with a documentary). Also, this movie has quickly become very popular among racing fans all over the world. If you follow F1, like me, then you will hear many references to Senna and this movie every now and then so it's almost a necessity to watch this. Overall, a great documentary and I could watch this in a movie theater if they play."
tt1424432,"I followed most of Ayrton Senna's career intently as he was a brilliant driver with incredible charisma which arguably made him bigger than even F1.I was though quite disappointed with this movie as I feel there were too many omissions. First of all a large part of the film is not in English, I am assuming Portuguese? I am not sure if some copies are in different languages as F1 is a global sport but one language or the other would make sense.Moving on though, any Senna documentary would surely require input from the most influential names. Fangio, Murray Walker, Jackie Stewart and Michael Schumacher are/were the most influential names in motor racing to such a degree that you can almost forget most other observers. They have all publicly spoken of Senna's genius yet not a single comment from any of these names was included.The film does not even make an attempt to set the scene properly. For those that don't know this was a unique time in Formula 1. We had Senna, probably the best driver of all time against Prost, another of the best drivers of all time.Now lets see what else was missing: Any mention of qualifying, his qualifying routine involved perfect timing and execution, which was the reason for his staggering number of pole positions throughout his career.His ability in the rain and on street circuits.His unique driving style - blipping the throttle through corners and so on. This has been analyzed by other broadcasters in depth.The very close relationship with Honda, the man and the company. Honda engines were supreme at the time and Honda stipulated that Senna be a McLaren driver due to his immense popularity in Japan. He also provided a lot of input into the NSX. The Senna line of products such as clothing, watches and bicycles.The failed early marriage.Punching Eddie Irvine and being punched by Mansell during the drivers' briefing.The film was always going to be a stitching together of archive footage yet it follows the various F1 seasons with no real purpose. 1988 is rightly shown in detail as it was his first championship yet the film completely misses the elephant in the room that the McLaren of that year was so dominant that the car won 15 out of the 16 races – a feat still unmatched in the history of the sport. In fact it would have been all 16 if Senna had not been taken-out by a back-marker late in the race.With no narration we are left to work things out ourselves. The 1993 season was one of Senna's finest even though he did not win the title, but virtually none of it was shown. Also in that year the European GP at Donnington is, many feel Senna's best race ever but not one second of that race was in the film.There was also a complete lack of statistics which could have gone some way to summarize Senna's career. Finally the period of silence observed at the race after Senna's death was not even shown.Instead of the above there was an obsession with Prost, of course he was Senna's direct competition for some years but there was just too much of him and Balestre.I did see a lot of non-racing footage I have never seen before which was interesting however it seems to me that the makers of Senna either ran out of money or just did not have access to some of the better on-track action.At the end of 1994 Michael Schumacher said he would give his world title to Senna if he could as Senna would have won it. If ever there was a quote that needed to be in this movie it was this one.I have to say this film goes down as a missed opportunity to tell the story of the greatest driver ever."
tt1424432,"As someone blessed to have witnessed the Senna Era, I found the film extremely disappointing the family footage was very grainy and in many instances didn't add much to the storyline. Very little footage was actually shown of his races, his pure genius as a driver seemed to become lost in the story line of politics and double dealing and while all of that was true and Ayrton was cheated out of several world titles I don't feel that the film did justice to his driving and the younger generations have missed out on something very special.Ayrton was the greatest driver formula has/will ever see and the film failed to to fully bring home the brilliance of the man and his career."
tt1853728,"Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is a bounty hunter. To identify his next catch, he tries to purchase Django (Jamie Foxx). Thing go all wrong Tarantino style. The two become friends and Dr Schultz decide on a plan to free Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from a notorious plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).This is Quentin Tarantino all the way. His style has become as unique & original as they come. There is no mistaking it for another. It's the music, the violence, the visuals, the black humor, and the subject matter. This is all Tarantino. If there is one complain, it's the double climax. While I understand the need for a happy Hollywood ending, it would have been better to have 1 big gun fight and just finish with it. Not that big of a deal. Certainly it's still a great film."
tt1853728,"This is a movie that wouldn't work with every other director other than Tarantino.
Just like all of his movies, film making top tier.
Every aspect of this film is amazing"
tt1853728,"A German bounty hunter flees a Slave, Django, and the pair embark on a mission to find Django's wife.As soon as I heard Luis Bacalov's Django, I was hooked.This remains my favourite Tarantino film, and let's be fair there are many classics in that particular catalogue.Django is equal parts shocking, entertaining, dramatic, bold, funny and original, to this day no other film exists that is remotely similar. It's a western, action packed love story, it really is a one off.Three hours passed by effortlessly, it's one of those films where I wasn't aware of time passing by, I was engrossed and absorbed into it.Some of the humour is hilarious, and in the context of the film works to perfection, the humour is as good, as the violence and misery of slavery are guy wrenching.The music is absolutely wonderful, the perfect soundtrack accompanies this great film. Indeed the whole production is exemplary, it's a skilfully crafted film, the visuals are jaw dropping, it's very skillfully put together, with costumes, sets and lighting all on point, with the unbelievable staging as well.Now I am sometimes quick to highlight who stands out in a film or TV series, but how can you do that here, every single performance is on point, Waltz, Foxx, DiCaprio, Jackson, I honestly don't think it gets better than this assembly of greats.It's no wonder it gave us so many memes, who hasn't seen this masterpiece. If you haven't grab your remote, and improve your day.10/10."
tt1853728,"Jango (D is silence) is just one of those movie you can watch every year and it never gets old.It's also the origin of those Di Caprio memes you saw online, so you know is good.Also Christoph Waltz stole the show here and made me discover all other his movies."
tt1853728,"(Jamie Fox, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, Walton Goggins, James Remar, Don Johnson, Bruce Dern & Samuel L. Jackson)Set in the Wild West in Texas in 1858, a former dentist turned bounty hunter named Schultz stumbles upon the Speck Brothers who are in transit moving slaves they own. Schultz gets to talking with a slave named Django inquiring if he's heard of the Brittle brothers, upon affirmation of such information Schultz proceeds to purchase Django if he helps him locate and take care of the brothers than he would grant Django his freedom along with a horse and $75. Schultz then takes Django under his wing training him the ways of the bounty hunter and he becomes his deputy. After successfully tracking and taking out the Brittle Brothers and many other targets over the winter Django tells Schultz his story of how he and his wife attempted to escape their former owner and then were sold separately, and how he would like to use that reward to purchase his wife back. They discover the location of a Mississippi plantation where Broomhilda, his wife , was sold. They learn the ruthless Calvin Candie Von Shaft is the new owner and they now know that a scheme needs to be plotted to successfully purchase Broomhilda without raising suspicion that she was the target all along.For a nearly three hour movie it certainly doesn't feel that way as the film is so action packed that it'll keep you on your toes the entire duration of the film. A beautifully produced piece of film that stacks up with every other great Tarantino film, it just fits the mold so perfectly. Well developed characters and a unique story like none other. So much originality has been missing in westerns i feel like this one fueled the next decade of great westerns that have been released. This long list of actors in this film is quite extraordinary as there was even more great actors i could have listed. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal and I'll admit i listen to this frequently it just fit the film perfect. The dialog was written so nicely creating some iconic scenes. Anyone who truly loves film can not get enough of this Tarantino masterpiece."
tt1853728,"Django Unchained is a 2012 Hollywood movie depicting the story of a former slave turned freeman who just wants to get his wife back. He will stop at nothing to unite with his wife.A brilliant masterpiece of a movie. The gut-wrenching way in which slavery in past-America is depicted is simply awe-inspiring. Quentin Tarantino goes all out to show the viewers what slavery was like in those days.Every character in the movie were aptly cast and put on a splendid show. Every scene with Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz is memorable and impressionable.All in all, this is a Tarantino movie. So, you gotta watch it. A revenge story so good that it will stir up your insides!"
tt1853728,"Quentin Tarantino, one of the most iconic directors of the 21st (and late 20th) century, why? Simple. Because of masterpieces like this. Tarantino defies the laws of film, he shoots them in his own way, however he wants. Tarantino has always focused upon the action thriller genre from Reservoir Dogs up until Inglourious Basterds. However, Django Unchained is Tarantino's first look at the Western genre, his first attempt at it and he executed it beautifully. The scenes were shot perfectly alongside an amazing soundtrack as well as his own small cameo.Django Unchained tells the story of Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is soon picked up by bounty hunter Dr King Shultz (Christoph Waltz). The story follows on as Shultz takes on Django as his ""deputy"" during their tasks of bounty hunting, in return Shultz says that after winter he will help find Django's lost wife, Broomhilda. This takes them to a huge plantation in Mississippi owned by Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), from here they plan up a scheme on how to get away with Broombilda.The cast boast out amazing performances, particularly Christoph Waltz (also famous for his previous collaboration with Tarantino on Inglourious Bastards as Colonel Landa). Both Foxx and DiCaprio's performance are both equally amazing. All three are able to add some light-hearted humour in the mix to make sure it doesn't stay too serious, as well as having comic actor Jonah Hill play a member of the KKK.There's a reason the film has been nominated for 5 Oscars."
tt1853728,"Django's luck, has taken quite a turn, the chains around his legs, have suddenly been spurned, Dr Schultz did him a favour, uncoupled him from viscous slavers, now they're off to see what bounties can be earned. The rewards are more enticing than plain cash, as they hunt down evil villains and watch them crash, their revolvers take them out, seldom having time to shout, it's akin to picking up, discarded trash. Now Django's keen to find his wife who's kept, by Calvin Candie who is cunningly adept, at keeping people tethered, disobey and they get leathered, but the duo plan to make an intercept.Great performances, great dialogue and a bountiful tale set during the less celebratory times of a countries history."
tt1853728,Tarantino is unpredictable. You never know what to expect in the next scene. And that's make the movie interesting. The music is also excellent. Only this blood is too much for me. So I give 8.
tt1853728,"I only had one thought on my mind for this Christmas: see Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino's latest opus, a Western set two years before the Civil War, concerns a former slave named Django (Jamie Foxx). He is freed by bounty hunter Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) in order to help him with a bounty. Quite quickly, Shultz takes Django under his wing and trains him as his partner. But he made him a promise: that he would rescue his wife from a plantation owned by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). And rescuing her is not going to be all that easy.What pains me the most about Django Unchained, as a die-hard Tarantino fan, is just how sloppy it all seems. I enjoyed every minute of it, but I could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels. Portions of the film feel episodic (the search for the Brittle Brothers, mentioned heavily in the trailers, begins and ends practically within minutes), and some scenes just seem to play out just for the fun of it. Another scene from the trailers involving a lynch mob with bags covering their faces seems added for comedic purposes, and has no real point of actually existing. More than any of his films before it, Django feels like Tarantino simply making a movie for sheer pleasure and with no outside motivations or controllers. The film threatens to go totally off the rails at any given moment, and lacks any real sense of direction or focus. It may sound ridiculous, but the loss of editor Sally Menke confirms a sneaking suspicion I always had about Tarantino – he needed a steady right hand to help encourage him as to what was needed and what was not. I do not want to criticize Django's editor Fred Raskin, but it is obvious he is no Menke and that works against the film heavily. It lacks the polish we have come to expect, and is practically stripped of the glossy/cool texture so prevalent in Tarantino's work up until now.But then maybe that was his intention all along, and perhaps Tarantino is airing out his frustrations with life and film in general. Django is deliberately shot on film (or at least from the print I saw), and looks very gritty and messy at all times. It is significantly more brutally violent than anything he has worked on before (the borderline cartoonish Kill Bill included), and has a very go for broke attitude about itself. The film seems to revel in how brilliantly it can splatter all the blood and gore (done through the use of squibs and no digital!), and how uncomfortably numbing it can make the violence. I know he does not care what people think of his films, but this movie especially seems like an emphatically raised middle finger to the establishment. And for all of my complaints about how messy it all feels, I was never once bored or felt like the movie was dragging itself out. The staggering 165-minute running time shockingly flies by faster than you might ever imagine.Acting wise, Tarantino stacks the deck with a number of recognizable character actors young and old for roles that vary in size. Most have very few lines, if any at all, and seem to just stand by, just as content as the audience is to watch the action unfold. It is a little off-putting, especially with how important some of these characters are initially made out to be. Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft (one of the most subtle references he's ever dropped) does well as the helpless victim and frequent dreamlike object – but she never really gets to show off any of her acting prowess outside of her facial reactions. They are increasingly effective, especially during horrific flashback scenes. But her work here feels ridiculously stunted in comparison to the other leads. Samuel L. Jackson, much like Tarantino himself, seems to just be having fun in his role as Candie's adviser Stephen. He plays on every ridiculous stereotype he ever has been associated with and then amps it up to a near ludicrous state. He is frequently hilarious, but the role seems to border on parody more than anything else.Surprisingly, Foxx takes a very long time settling into the leading role. It may just be the character, but it is quite clear from the on- set that he is not very comfortable in Django's shoes, and leads credence to why Will Smith, amongst so many others, dropped out of the picture so quickly. But once he finds his footing, he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. It is not an easy character to play, but Foxx makes it his own, bringing a sense of style and grace that are virtually absent from the rest of the film. And of course, he gets all the best lines.Waltz and DiCaprio are the clear standouts however, nailing every nuance of their sadly underwritten characters. While Waltz plays the straight man, DiCaprio is delightfully unhinged and vicious. Both are playing directly against type, yet are strangely comfortable in the roles. Watching them act circles around the rest of the cast, Foxx included, is the true highlight of the film. I just wish they were both given additional emphasis and more to do. For all of its numerous faults, I had a blast watching Django Unchained. It is hilarious, it is a lot of fun, and is wildly enjoyable. I genuinely think it could have been a lot better if there was more focus and direction, but this is very clearly a picture Tarantino wanted to make on his own terms. And for that, I applaud him for the effort. It is not his best work, but certainly not his worst. 8/10."
tt1853728,"Probably the best Tarantino film in my opinion. But let's be fair, it's really close. Regardless, Django represents everything I appreciate about this director. Drama, comedy, amazing dialogue, extreme violence, etc. I named my dog after this masterpiece, so remember the D is silent!"
tt1853728,"I just saw this film and I confess that I am completely satisfied. I am not an admirer of Tarantino but I have little to say about this film, inspired by a character from the sixties western-spaghetti films and mixing western with blacksploitation. Tarantino's style (exaggerated, showy, extravagant and excessive) is all there before us, but unlike other films I didn't feel that this was a problem or transformed the film into a kind of parody.The plot is about the search that Django, a former slave who is unexpectedly released and becomes a bounty hunter, will do for his wife, a slave who was sold and disappeared. He has the help of a German, responsible for his release. Together they discover that she is at the home of a rude slave-owner called Cotton Candy who, among other businesses, profits from death fights between slaves. So they decide to disguise themselves as experts in the field to go to his plantation and try to buy her freedom without Candy realizing what they want.The film is very good and, despite being almost three hours long, it has no dead moments and entertains wonderfully. However, although Tarantino's exaggerations and histrionic vision were not a problem this time, there are some points that were really uncomfortable, mainly concerning historical rigor, which, we already know, is not something that he really takes seriously (another reason why I don't like him as a director). To begin with, such Mandingo Fights never existed. We are not in Ancient Rome and the slave owners, however bad they were, did not like to throw money out the window and kill for pleasure their best pieces! Tarantino went to get that silly idea from another film he liked and pasted it here. Another problem is the use of dynamite, which would only be invented a few years after the period in which the film takes place. The clothes also do not match the time or place of the action. The outfit of the Club's black maid, with that miniskirt, is particularly bad in that it sexualizes the character and imports a 21st century scent into the middle of the 19th century. I will not go on much longer, I think I proved my point. Another thing I have to say is that this is a very violent film, Tarantino style, that is, with a ton of blood for each bullet, spectacular shootings, some nudity and high doses of brutality. The dialogues are also full of racist insults and profanity, but I think that was something the film asked for, in support of its own credibility. In short, this is not a movie for anyone. With Tarantino, this is often taken for granted.The main role was given to Jamie Foxx, and he is superb and gives the character a strength and toughness that I liked, and which contrast nicely with the polite sensitivity of Dr. Schultz, brilliantly played by Christopher Waltz. This actor had already done an extraordinary job in ""Inglorious Bastards"" and now he was even better, with a character that seems tailor-made for him. I was particularly impressed with the work of Leonardo Di Caprio, who rarely manages to make villains. He is an actor with a rare talent and has managed to be worthy of our contempt in this film. Another actor who shines in this film is the veteran Samuel L. Jackson, in the role of a black butler so fond of the owner that he becomes more slavish than whites. I also liked the brief cameo of honor of Franco Nero, the actor who played Django in the original films. It was an elegant and honorable way for Tarantino to bow to the actor and the work that inspired him. Much less impressive was the performance of Kerry Washington, who has little time and material to show what is worth.Technically, it is a film full of notable aspects that require our attention and that, to a large extent, are part of the director's brand image. It is the case of cinematography and the use of strong colors and slow motion footage in action scenes, features of a strong visual style that Tarantino loves. The sets are good, and also the costumes despite the anachronisms that I have mentioned. The film has a pleasant pace, but the first half was generally better yet more restrained: it seems that Tarantino gets lost in his own style as he approaches the most violent scenes. The soundtrack is great and takes advantage of several songs by various composers. Personally, I enjoyed listening to the original song from ""Django"" by Luis Bacalov, and the songs composed for this film by Ennio Morricone, a name that will always be associated, in collective memory, with the great western-spaghetti of the past. It was a careful, effective and honorable selection in the way it honors the genre."
tt1853728,"This is a fun movie! Great acting, great soundtrack, great editing and great story! The scenes in the big house...top class! Every scene with Leonardo diCaprio was amazing! Now my problems with the movie: the main meat of the movie, the mid section, dragged on a little too long and some of the dialogue was a bit dull but it was necessary to tell the story. The opening of the movie though, was great, I was hooked instantly and the end was so chaotic and fast paced! I wasn't expecting this movie to be as hilarious as it was either, so many scenes had the timing of humour spot on and actually made me laugh out loud. The story isn't complicated or hard to follow which is good, I enjoyed being able to relax and watch the movie unfold. I like this...9/10."
tt1853728,"Interesting plot, story and events. Above average soundtrack and good actors who are really amiable and suitable. Excellent photography and directing of the movie. Holds excellent messages though many things need to be clearer. Just enough comedy to be mixed with drama. Sequence of events is good to very good but could've been much better. The movie was very good and had just the perfect amount of western style inclusion but for most people I think they expected more in addition to the amount of drama. The movie showed how crucial the slavery of black people was but didn't show how crucial it was for the other blacks (other than him and his wife and couple of others) and this was very disappointing taking into consideration how long the movie was. I think the movie should've been also count as a drama and an action. Overall, the movie was very good and fun to watch and sophisticated in a way, plus it was just enough western and drama that will not make you depressed. Rating: 7.125/10 Final rating percentage: 71%"
tt1853728,"Absolutely loved every minute of this movie. Usually I'm not too crazy about Tarantino's movies, but this one is definitely the best one I've seen in a long time. The actors were picked perfectly. The overall experience of a movie is amazing. When we first went to watch it, I was a bit skeptical and thought I'd end up leaving an hour into the movie (it's a 3 hr movie), but it grabbed my attention from the very beginning and I didn't even wanna get up to go to the bathroom, afraid to miss something. I'm usually very particular about the movies, nothing can hardly satisfy me, but this one is definitely in the top 5. Soundtrack was perfect. When I got home, I've done some more research on it and loved it even more! Overall, I would highly recommend this film!"
tt1853728,"In Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, there is a scene in which Django (Jamie Fox), soon after being freed by the incredibly likable dentist turned bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), shops for new clothes to wear. Schultz tells Django to pick out whatever he likes. Django looks at the smiling white man in disbelief. You're gonna let me pick out my own clothes? Django can't believe it. The following shot delivered one of the biggest laughs from the audience I watched the film with. After the white man confirms that yes, he is indeed letting the black man pick out his own clothes, we cut to a wide shot of Django riding his horse, now decked out in his very own (outlandish) cowboy outfit—an all blue with white ruffle get-up. It's a great little scene that provides humor and allows the viewer to further warm up to the two main protagonists. But it also does more than that. It's a simple scene that speaks for the whole film. It's an affirmation that this man of color is now free and able to make his own decisions. The choice he made concerning his extravagantly loud outfit acts as a warning to those that plan to stand in his way—watch out, here I come, I ain't gonna be quiet no more.And the humor the scene provides echoes the entire film—it wants us to get comfortable with our hero. Tarantino knows that a man of color makes an unconventional hero in a revenge- flick—that's why he made the film. When was the black man going to get his revenge film? It's been long overdue. With Django Unchained, that film has finally arrived and it has arrived in style. Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and meticulously written, it's Tarantino at his most epic."
tt1675434,"Do not look at this through the prism of ""Foreign Films"". You'd be wasting your time and miss something far too important.Hollywood does scale like nobody else, leaving the competition gasping in its wake. France does intimacy, and brutality. Nothing is sacred. And rather than try to revive the New Wave or emulate Hollywood like most widely seen French films of late, ""Intouchables"" harnesses its core strengths - ease with intimacy, willingness to ridicule anything and brutal honesty - and delivers one of the funniest, most honest and touching films I have ever seen.Sy is a failed robber, going through the motions and playing the stereotypical jobless émigré. Cluzet is a romantic and melancholy mind trapped in a useless body. The circumstances that bring them together are too funny to spoil here, but meet they do, and an awkward relationship quickly blossoms as they bring out the best in each other.The film's simplicity is delightfully misleading: the script is a masterpiece of comedy writing, and however good the rest of the cast is, the central duo is magical. Sy's comic timing will have you in stitches, but it is his honesty and vulnerability that make you fall in love with the character. Cluzet isn't your typical sad-sack, instead, much of the finest pleasures in the film consist in watching him use his keen mind to mess with the world around him (a subplot about an abstract painting really takes the biscuit, you'll know it when you see it).This is one of the most unique, beautiful and honest friendships ever committed to film. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry... a delightful celebration of everything in life that makes it worthwhile."
tt1675434,"I am now trying to find words to describe this movie for an hour. I couldn't.You've seen it, or you haven't. It's monumental and outrageously good.The cast is brilliant. The jokes lovely. The story and the idea behind the movie is beautiful. Especially when you've worked/lived with handicapped people. The music is such a perfect choice, it is unbelievable.I hope this movie makes a plenty of people think about how good their life is and how bad it could have been.Bottom line: Oscar-worthy. Period."
tt1675434,"In less than two months, ""Untouchable"" became the second most successful French film by number of spectators, such an event by itself that people went then to see it, not because they thought it was good but to see what was so good in it: that's the virtual circle of success. My biggest disappointment in 2011 was with ""The Tree of Life"", a movie I sincerely wanted to love but couldn't, and I left the theater before it ended with a bitter taste of frustration. Proportionally, my greatest positive surprise came with ""Untouchable"" because it was the opposite expectation: I was sure I would dislike it, figuring the movie manipulated viewers through the overused device of the improbable friendship. Why such preconceived negativity? Well, when a young black guy from French suburbs, darkly depicted in Mathieu Kassovitz 'Hate' and infamous for its occasional riots, befriends a rich quadriplegic, I immediately think of 'good feelings', 'mainstream populism'  unaware that I apply to myself a cynical judgment that can undermine my very way to enjoy not just this film, but any film. After all, why getting ready for hatred when it's so relieving to give the benefit of the doubt and get ready for appreciation? Especially since more than 15 millions of French people, from different ages and backgrounds liked it. So, I saw it  and loved it.The story of ""Untouchable"" is the kind of unintentional masterpiece that only movies can provide every once in a while, it has no other pretension than to depict a magnificent and inspiring friendship story starting as a simple job. A young man with a Senegalese background, Omar Sy as Driss, only needs a signature to prove that he attended an interview for a live-in carer job. For some strange reason, Paul, the rich man, played by a wonderful François Cluzet, gives him the job, with a one-month trial period. The reason of this choice is smoothly handled by the script: the film starts with all the job applicants, every one of them unnaturally posing and getting mixed in prepared answers. Then, Driss casually enters, without waiting for his turn or knocking on the door, he's got enough problems to deal with, unemployment, an experience in jail, being a pariah for society, and undesirable even in his own family, especially her adoptive aunt. Driss' attitude pleases Paul, because after his paragliding accident, he can't feel his body from neck to toes, and needs caring almost 24 hours per days and 7 days per week, so he really doesn't have time for bullshit either. And this is a remarkable aspect in the script written by the two directors Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache: it doesn't waste time cementing the friendship, the two leads rapidly get fond of each other, a feeling illustrated in the poster with both posing with natural smiles. The film shows Omar's struggle to learn how 'needy' Paul is, which provides some priceless comedic moments, but ""Untouchable"" goes immediately to the core, an eye-opening message about the life endured by a handicapped person, making all the wealth in the world pointless and the richness of heart and mind, priceless. Through Driss and Paul's interaction, the film explores the real needs of people in life, respect and understanding, acceptance and love. Maybe if it was handled by other directors, it would have been predictable but in ""Untouchable"", the complicity between the two heroes feels absolutely real. There's one scene when Driss shave the bushy beard of Paul, well, I won't spoil it for you, but the part was a clever mix of realism and comedy because anyone would have done what Driss did at one moment, and that's the secret of the film: it feels real.Some movies can work with a good story but they need good performances, in ""Untouchable"", it's almost impossible to determine who carried the film, both Cluzet and Sy were great. And I don't get the complaints: why they didn't respect the original story where the carer was an Arab, or how they 'sugarcoated' the handicap? I even heard that in America, they were accusing the film of racism because Driss was portrayed as a sort of (I quote) 'helper monkey'? Seriously, this is getting old The way handicap is approached never flirts with an exaggerated pathos, nor the opposite, which is the most intelligent achievement. There's a sort of heart's intelligence in the way Omar teases Cluzet with his own handicap, and the film provides the extraordinary message that pleasure and thrills have unlimited media, whether they come from pot, an ear-massage or even paragliding. Many of Paul's friends criticizes the presence of Driss in Paul's life, but Paul doesn't care: Omar is a man full of life, big, tall and strong, and when he uses violence to teach a man the respect of a parking sign, Paul admits this is the right method. Both are in the same wavelength. I wondered if the title ""Untouchable"" referred to the lowest caste in India, echoing the two men's conditions, both outcasts physically and socially, but I guess, their relationship evolves into a friendship precisely because they're both strong-minded, and together, they become even stronger, until getting untouchables ... in the noblest meaning of the word.There are real people in ""Untouchable"", nothing works as plot devices even if some situations are so cinematically appealing: Omar inviting everybody to dance during Paul's birthday, his learning of the aristocratic world, the art of abstract painting, and the way he breaks the conventions with an unconventional charisma reaches a level of energetic comedy that reminds of the greatest days of Eddie Murphy, with Cluzet as a perfect straight-man not deprived from a sense of humor. ""Untouchable"" is simply an inspiring story of friendship with whatever defines this beautiful virtue. And yes, it's one of the best French films ever, and certainly one of the best of 2011."
tt1675434,"Being french and a film maker myself, I have high standards for ratings, and this one definitely deserves in 10/10. I've not seen a film showing our world with such humour in a long time. The jokes are absurd and possibly, with a touch of British humour to them. The directing is beautiful, the acting is incredible, the shots are somehow truthful, if I can say that about a shot. It may be Omar Sy's first time in a leading role, for a major production, but he really delivered, and not just in the funny parts, the delivery of emotions was just spotless. Francois Cluzet was also just as brilliant, as he usually is. I will be recommending this film to everyone, and seriously hoping it will be released in the UK soon enough for me to see it again! Only negative aspect... the Americans are thinking of doing a remake... why do they always have to? I mean would you reconsider remaking the ""Joconde"" or the Sixtine Chapel to American standards? Film is an art like any other, it travels the world as it is... no need for remakes..."
tt1675434,"It has been 9 weeks now since Intoucblaes has come to the movie theaters. I did not give it much thought at first, but the universal acclaim I have heard convinced me to go see it. I don't over-stating the universality of the acclaim, people of various races, classes, colors & countries told me it was a must see. I had no expectations, and I was floored. Intouchables, directed by Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache, starring Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy is possibly the best French movie of the year. This is not because of a lack of worthy contenders, but truly because Intouchables is that profound. It touches on themes of presumptions, social class difference, health, and as naïve as it may sound, the universality of humanity. The story is not as important as is the relationship that is displayed between the two protagonists. Philippe (played by Cluzet) a rich aristocrat that loves adrenaline rushes finds himself a paraplegic after a paragliding incident. Driss (played by Sy) is, in appearance a typical hoodlum from the ghetto. The two are brought together and wonders happen. The audience then sees how the men affect one another as they engage in a truly honest relationship. Driss is charismatic, lighthearted and funny, helping make Philippe's life enjoyable again. In the process the traditionally cold French aristocracy around Philippe warms up and lightens. He is like a hot knife through cold butter. Again, it is not so much the story that is important as is the social commentary. The commentary is not judgmental and is very subtle, revealed only in the contrasts the director chose in the story and its contexts. His method reminded me of a sort of Zen approach to comedy. One example you can catch from the trailer alone is the contrast between the able bodied black Driss and t the crippled white man, etc. The audience is also given wonderful sights of Paris and France as we go through the Pyrenees, Cabourg and the various streets of Paris. On paper the review does not make the movie justice. It is hilarious in a way that is true, honest and by which anyone can relate to. Most importantly it is revealing and comforting in its reminder of the essential in life : love. It's approach is simple, pure and honest and that makes it worthy of the title of ""best movie of the year"". I cannot say more; the film must be experienced. My friends tried, they failed, so I trusted them and I saw it. It floored me. Go and be floored. PS - I heard American studios have purchased the rights for the film. They will need a brilliant director, screenwriters and perfect actors to make the original justice in the way ""The Departed"" did for ""Infernal Affairs""."
tt1675434,"Well, I've just got out of the theater and i must say that all the reviews are right. this is an amazing film! The actors are simply the best, Omar is not only a great comic but also a great actor.The filming has a certain touch that brings to mind ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" in the way the director was able to capture not only the suffering of Phillip but also the joy.Not wanting to spoil the film for others, i highly recommend seeing this in the theaters and with a loved one.It is also a good film for teenagers as it holds a few wonderful life lessons.Enjoy."
tt1675434,"Just seen last night, amazing movie, great performances from actors, particularly from Omar, and Cluzet is great as usual. Photography of images are great, supported by good choice of locations supporting actors are all good and natural so doing a great job to give a great solid base to the story. RIch of emotions on a simple story where ordinary people become extraordinary. Good representation of social differences in France without being too heavy on it. Simple, beautiful, efficient, like a good French cuisine, making a great dish full of tastes magically mixed :) Most to be watched and even more emotional when you know its based on true story !"
tt1675434,"This movie surprised us. We checked on IMDb and saw 8/10 for a french movie, without hesitation we went to the movie theatre to watch the movie.The subject is hard but the movie is really funny. In a few seconds you are fully projected within the film from the beginning to the end. There is no special effet but the actors are playing very well and the movie is based on a real story.If you are skeptical for French movie don't be for this one ... it is a must see movie.Enjoy the movie."
tt1675434,"It's not because I'm French that I appreciated this movie which I've seen twice. Too give the really infamous appreciation of the reader from Toronto to the French public, qualifying us of a segregationist country is difficult to gulp especially coming from north America which has not a very glorious past on the matter even in recent years. Perhaps the commentator should see the movie ""The help"" to refresh his memory... But what I'd like to say here apart of praising the fabulous interpretation of both leading actors is to remind that this is a true story, it did not come out from the directors and scriptwriter heads.Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo born in 51, got a dramatic para-glider accident in the French Alps in 1993 being totally deprived of movements from the base of his neck to the tip of his feet. 3 Years later his wife died and he was helped out of his depression by Abdel Sellou his life-aid assistant. He published his terrible story in 2001 under the title ""the second breath"" (in French ""Le second soufflé""). The directors have had the compliments of Di Borgo for the way they adapted his story. If in any way this was biased he would never had accepted the film to be left in that state. The Di Borgo family is a very old and wealthy family whose origins goes far back in the history of France, and their residence in Paris is considered to be one the jewels of the capital at the same level as The Hotel de Sully in Paris. What is shown in the film is exactly what happens everywhere in the world as far as handicapped are concerned: tendency to overwhelm them with pity which is more diminishing them as if their fate is not enough for them to swallow every minute or second each day. The way the racial problem is viewed is properly demonstrated. The police behaves in different ways depending of the color of your skin or your country's origin and sorry to say North America is a very good example of this so perhaps is not a proper judge on this matter.The authors had the courage to state this straightforwardly. The film shows on the contrary how a man with a very limited education at the beginning, a former convict, is capable progressively to change his views, and find in himself at the same time the good Samaritan aspects and help with humor and punch, his handicapped boss to find a new belief in his shattered life at 42! At the same time the boss demonstrates an open-mindedness which was not obvious to get not only because of his handicap but because of his origins and his wealth at first. Let's not illusion ourselves on the matter, everywhere in the world few wealthy people would accept to have as an aid an ex convict whichever color his skin should be! It's a fantastic lesson of tolerance, and friendship. For just those reason this movie would deserve an Oscar or Golden Globe awards.09/07/2013 : I've just seen that under ""Crazy credits"" is mentioned that 5% of the revenues of the film will go to an institutions caring for disabled persons. I just don't see what's crazy about that! I find this kind of remark particularly shocking and insulting both for the producers and the actors especially in this case where the story told is a true one.I suggest the administrator to delete that remark or change its qualification."
tt1675434,"I have seen this movie tonight at a preview session as the official french national release is set on 2011, November 2nd. Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakashe, accompanied by the lead actor Omar Sy were meeting the audience and cheerfully answering questions.The movie is very well written. Although opening on a flash-forward, it is fairly classic comedy about the meeting of two opposite people who were very unlikely to meet. The first one is a paraplegic white middle aged very rich and lonely man, the other one is a young black, poor, unemployed, coming from poor suburbs and a very large family.What makes the quality of the film, beside the humour present in every scene in which Omar Sy appears (actually most of the film), is the emotion you can feel, through increasingly attaching characters.The story is based upon a true story, and real characters.If you want to watch and enjoyable comedy, with very touching moments, this is a must go.There are interesting insights about arts as well (paintings, classical music, and funk music). What is art? What is its use?"
tt1675434,"I CANNOT BELIEVE that ""Bridesmaids"" is nominated for an Oscar, just like Brad Pitt for his completely boring and not convincing part in ""Moneyball"", when in 2011 such a great movie was made!!! Did the Academy even see this?It's a shame and in my opinion proves that the ""Academy Awards"" are just ridiculous and have nothing to do with good film and acting. Francois Cluzet's performance is outstanding, as is Omar Sy and the story is just lovely and touching in a wonderful non-Hollywood way. (REMAKE? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?)Spread the word and enjoy this beautiful movie!!!"
tt1675434,"This french film starts with a Dustin Hoffman look-alike actor being driven by a black driver (Omar Sy) who is fond of Earth, Wind and Fire music and has a swagger made popular by many a black Hollywood actors including Eddie Murphy. In the typical Hollywood fashion he comes from the wrong side of tracks (think of Murphy in Trading Places), but ends up living in a Paris mansion (again echoes of Trading Places) taking care of a quadriplegic (François Cluzet). Somehow he learns to take care of his patient and in fact becomes quite an accomplished male nurse. The transition is mildly amusing, and won't bother you if you checked your skepticism at the door before entering the movie theater. If you have any doubts about whether or not this film is in the genre called Hollywood fantasy, you have to see what our tough man with heart of gold does next. He decides to teach his boss how to be a good father and ultimately becomes cupid for his boss. The film plays on the obvious disparities between expectations and attitudes of the privileged and under classes in ways that are funny. If you wish to enjoy this film, please keep your expectations low and ignore the obvious visual and other tricks. One of the early scenes shows a row of shoes and socks of the candidates waiting to be interviewed for the nurse's job. As the camera pans, all candidates are wearing shiny shoes with clean socks, but one pair stand out for being dirty and incongruous. Of course, they belong to Omar Sy's character and he gets the job at this super-rich household. How fuuunny!! I predict that in two to three years there will be a Hollywood clone of this film with Dustin Hoffman and Chris Rock playing the main characters. And it will be a box office hit."
tt1675434,"This is one of the best movies we have ever seen. My wife and I see 3 movies a week on average over The past 40 years. Saying it is one of the best is quite a statement. This French movie with sub titles is simply Spectacular. The storyline involves a man crippled in An accident, his wife has passed away and he cannot Find adequate help which he requires 24/7. Until he meets the Most unlikely of people to care for him. The acting by Omar Sy & Mr. Cluzet Is the very best. The movie has everything you want in a Movie. It has compassion and is spectacularly Funny. Run to see this movie. The two prime Actors must be recognized for a whole host Of awards. Wow!"
tt1675434,"Intouchables is a true story of Philippe ,a rich aristocrat who is paralyzed from neck down and Driss ,an unemployed man coming from a poverty stricken family..Francois & Omar as the lead cast give a superb performance .. The charismatic Omar (Driss) is just amazing..His very presence on screen is powerful as he juggles between rib-tickling comedy and some serious drama...Francois (Philippe) is on par with Omar...He gives a very controlled performance and is able to hold strong against Omar's contrasting character.Considering,Francois had to act as a quadriplegic, he has done an amazing job..His expressions itself substitute any needs of dialogues.. The bond the two develop is pure gem.Story is smooth and never drags..It could have been an intense drama movie,but the directors usage of comedy made it stand out from other similar stories..Direction is sharp & the movie doesn't rely on any over the top scenes..The music is beautifully blended into the movie and it enhances the effectiveness of many scenes...The Intouchables can be described by one word..Beautiful...The movie is a must watch for all..Acting- 5/5 Story- 5/5 Direction- 5/5 Comedy- 5/5 Drama- 5/5"
tt1675434,"wow, what a wonderful movie!! full of love, friendship and laughs. just like i always said, when a french movie is good, it's not just good, it's great! and this movie simply explains it. no wonder this movie would have won some international awards, it really deserved it. with these two great actors of two generation, the performances of both is just a perfect casting job. this is an absolutely feeling-good movie, warm up your heart without any intention. in this movie, you will see how it's like day and night that the extreme poverty of the immigrant families and the extreme prosperity of the french rich people. by contrast, this movie used it to prove that oil and water could have mixed together and evolved into a very heartfelt social structure. i enjoyed it 100%."
tt1675434,"In Paris, the aristocratic and intellectual Philippe (François Cluzet) is a quadriplegic millionaire that is interviewing candidates for the position of his caretaker with his red-haired secretary Magalie (Audrey Fleurot). Out of the blue, the rude African Driss (Omar Sy) cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from the Social Security and asks to Phillipe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position to receive his unemployment insurance.Philippe challenges Driss and offers a period of adaptation of one week to him to gain experience helping him. Then Driss would decide whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the bet and moves to the mansion, changing the boring life of Phillipe and his employees. ""Intouchables"" is a beautiful and uplifting story of friendship based on a true story. My daughter had watched this movie a couple of months ago when she was traveling on vacation and recommended it a lot to me and yesterday I saw it on DVD.The screenplay is excellent and the directors and writers Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano have a magnificent work. This theme in the hands of a weak director could transform the uplifting story into a corny or melodramatic movie. But they succeeded making a funny and touching comedy.The cast is also fantastic, and the chemistry between François Cluzet and Omar Sy is amazing. Anne Le Ny is also wonderful and Audrey Fleurot is a very beautiful woman and excellent actress in her ambiguous role luring Driss. In the end, I went to bed late but feeling good. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Intocáveis (""Untouchables"")"
tt1675434,"This was for sure one of the Top5 or Top10 movies I've ever seen. The actors, the ambiente, the story ... simply everything was in a perfect combination. This film is for me in a league with films like ""The Elephant Man"", but for a much wider audience. And as the title say, after this film I really have to consider to reduce my ratings for several films, because it seems a bit unfair to put them on the same level as this film, although I don't have anything to criticize on them at all. All the persons in the film are very authentic played. And both main characters surprised me with a brilliant performance. I would say, that both actors are really what they are playing in the film. If I would see François Cluzet in the street, I would be surprised not seeing him in a wheelchair. The emotions shown in the last sequence of the film are so brilliant."
tt1675434,"'THE INTOUCHABLES': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A French comedy-drama film that has become the third biggest foreign film and biggest foreign language film of all time. It's also received rave reviews and a great deal of award recognition, but no 2012 Academy Award nomination (due to the fact that the foreign language division was afraid it would win). The film is beloved the world over but perhaps just a little over-hyped. It's a good movie but it is clichéd and somewhat simple and unoriginal. It's been criticized for being another tale that revolves around rich white people being enlightened and finding happiness through poor black people. It does seem like the type of movie Eddie Murphy might have starred in in the 80s, perhaps with Dustin Hoffman (because the lead white actor in the film bares a striking resemblance to Dustin Hoffman).The film stars Francois Cluzet as an aristocrat, named Philippe, who was paralyzed in a paragliding accident. He's somewhat depressed and has lost most communication with his adopted daughter Elisa (Alba Gaia Kraghede Bellugi). He also has phantom pains which keep him up at night and still mourns the death of his wife greatly, who died before they could have any kids of their own. He maintains romantic relationships with women only through written letters and fears actually meeting or speaking with them. One day he's looking for a new caretaker and a man named Driss (Omar Sy) enters his home just looking for a signature so he can continue to collect welfare checks. Driss lives with his large family in a small flat in a Parisian suburb. So when Philippe actually does offer him a job as well as a room in his mansion, that has it's own large bathtub in it, it's quite a culture shock for him. Of course Philippe is inspired by Driss and both men's lives are forever changed.The film was written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. It is nicely directed and looks beautiful. It also has a nice combination of both comedy and drama and both elements are done well. It's just that the film isn't that funny or that emotionally moving. The performances are fine, it has some good laughs and it's a good well intentioned story but it's nothing we haven't seen before and far from anything spectacular. It's enormous success does puzzle me a little but I'd much rather see a movie like this do really well than something like 'TWILIGHT'. So it's definitely a decent crowd-pleasing film, just not a great one.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcoZRlVFMzA"
tt1675434,"A comedy like that is tough to master. Balancing the funny and the dramatic stuff and still keep enough character development inside. And while I wouldn't say that both characters really redeem themselves (wholly), it gives them nice touches. Touches that include quite a lot of non-PC behavior (be alert and do not watch, if you are sensible to that sort of thing).It is a french comedy with heart. And it was a sleeper hit in Germany. Word of mouth made this a big success. A bit of credit has to go to the people who dubbed it I guess (I watched the original version with subtitles), because they must have done a phenomenal job. It is not perfect, but that fact makes it even weirder and more adorable"
tt1675434,"I feel like I need to say something. Not only is this in the IMDb top 250, its very close to the top, sitting at #38. This means its higher than Das Boot, The Shining, The Pianist, and more than 80% of the other incredible films on this list. I don't think every movie in the top 250 is a masterpiece, but most of the ones I've seen attain a certain level of quality that sets them apart from your ""average"" movie. I rented this movie hoping it would at least be good, but I didn't even get that.There's not much to say other than every aspect was competently done but nothing exceptional (that goes for the story, performances, production value, and direction). My only real complaint would be that our two leads are a bit one dimensional. Why are rich people always stereotyped as loving classical music and listening to nothing else? Driss is a bit too erratic and clueless to be believable, but that's just me.Clearly I'm missing something because everyone seems to love this movie. If you want to check it out, I won't stop you. It's put together well enough to be enjoyed, but for me personally it left little impact, and I can think of literally hundreds of films more deserving of such a high spot on this list. I give it a 6/10, and a generous 6 at that."
tt1675434,"Its a harmless clichéd ridden comedy. Its identical to Hollywood films in pacing, plot and structure. Its well executed and may be entertaining for someone who doesn't have a sophisticated taste for movies.The fact that one of the main characters is quadriplegic doesn't affect the basic plot by any measurable degree. Its a traditional story of a rich guy meets a poor guy and the two become friends. The rich guy likes classical music, the poor guy likes pop music. The rich guy likes art, the poor guy, prostitutes. Etc The cliché goes on and on. Only someone who has watched few movies will be impressed by this story: its extremely conventional.The jokes can be funny sometimes. Specially the ones where the characters exploit the fact that he is quadriplegic. Since one cannot find these jokes in other comedies. But overall the film is okay, but not good and is not worthy of being viewed in a theater."
tt1675434,"My my where do I begin.To start with I did not want the movie to end at all. Its becoming more and more rare for movies as this one to come by. This movie completes the circle, as far as movie going experience goes. The movie has left me with a sort of warm feeling in my heart that cannot be said in words alone. There is something about the way French movies are made, when they get it right they are simply par excellence. Hollywood kisses concrete.Anyway, I feel most of us humans are quadriplegic though not physically but emotionally in someway or other. But what one may agree is that when you cry you cry alone, but when you laugh the whole world laughs with you.If just by the word ""quadriplegic"" you are expecting it to be a dark, heart shattering, emotionally overloaded movie then I would passionately defend against such a prejudiced opinion. One is not the physical form alone. One can have a beautiful body but a black heart and vice-verse.A very well written, full bodied script and an exceptionally well directed movie. Characters cannot become more real than this on the silver screen. Omar Sy in my opinion has done a very good job. He lived his character and not played it. To contrast him we have François Cluzet who kept the sparks flying. Omar Sy's comments on Bach, Vivaldi etc classics had me in splits. And also do not miss out on the singing Human tree, the very mentioning of which is having me in splits.Wow !!! that was some movie. Go get this movie guys and see it today, no now."
tt1675434,"This movie does not really need another review, but after seeing what Daily Beast's (Marlow Stern) and Variety's (Jay Weissberg) critics have written about it, I feel that one thing needs a serious clarification. It is somewhat disturbing and, at the same time, really telling a lot about USA's culture that American reviewers see this movie as ""race-relations"" feature.I've read all of the 38 reviews written here on IMDb until now and I would suggest to both Stern and Weissberg to do the same. Maybe they could learn something. Most of the reviews here were written by non-Americans and, tellingly, most of them do not even mention race or race relations or anything similar. To me that shows how deep anything to do with a difference in color of skin has been intertwined with USA culture when even in this film - where nobody from, let's say the rest of the world, does not see any racism or anything similar - the only thing USA critics do see is the difference in color of skin. Sad, very sad.I'm, therefore, afraid that, if it shares Stern's and Weissberg's opinions, most of the USA audience will not see the real beauty of this film and will, probably also under the influence of critics' reviews, see the movie as a race-relations feature when that's the only thing it's not.And what it is? It is (I can't believe I'm gonna write this) a carefree comedy about a quadriplegic and his personal aide. The movie does not at any moment come even close to apathy or pathetics which is a success on its own. The movie also has just about the perfect amount of black humor and political incorrectness and does not cross those borders at any time. I think this is the only movie about a disabled human where, after seeing it, you will go out of the theater laughing. And I can't remember any movie which approaches such a difficult theme with such ease.Additionaly, the soundtrack - both Einaudi's score as well as selected tracks - is fantastic.A lot has been written here about cast and I would just like to add that along masterful performances of both Sy and Cluzet, the rest of the actors are equally great, especially Anne Le Ny and Audrey Flerot."
tt8716334,"As a Jersey boy myself, I have been following Bruce Springsteen for several decades as my friends and I went down to the Jersey Shore for summer adventures over the years. We met Bruce on several occasions in Asbury Park before he became so big we could never have front row seats again. When he was young, he played his music as if he were older. Now that he is old, he plays his music as if he were younger. I liked his transition from hard rock and roll to folk rock. It was the opposite transition that Bob Dylan, another icon of folk, took in his later years. Dylan was vilified for his transition, but Springsteen makes the transition as smooth as silk. His comfort with acoustic guitar and piano seemed like he is actually relieved that he can play to a more intimate atmosphere with his audience. His rendition of Born in the USA gives us the real feeling behind the composition of that piece, which was misinterpreted by millions during his heyday. It was not a song of proud Americanism and patriotism, but a lamentation of a returning veteran from the Vietnam War; another event I attended when I was younger. This one was a lot more entertaining."
tt8716334,"Springsteen On Broadway is two and a half hours of just Bruce (his wife, Patti Scialfa, makes a brief appearance) telling stories and playing music. It is NOT a concert and he plays only a few of his many 'hits.' Instead, Springsteen On Broadway is the story of a man who made his living performing the magic act of making spellbinding, story-based music. He uses the usual microphones you see at a musical performance instead of those used in the theatre and this establishes, immediately, that he is not an 'actor' but rather a performer who tells stories. In fact, he ignores the mics and often walks away from them so that his voice has no amplification and this makes his performance even more 'real.' Director Thom Zimny has done a masterful job of keeping the show moving, having unobtrusive stage hands bring out to Bruce various guitars and an harmonica."
tt8716334,"Well I am a fan and I've just read the autobiography so I was interested to see this. When I had 2.5 hours to spare.It's not just singing, he's also a bit of a raconteur. The stories will be familiar to anyone who's read the book.He does state right at the start that he'd never worked in a factory and done five days a week ('until now. I hate it'). It's surprising to me that one reviewer is disappointed in this. Somehow hearing that someone is making it all up (writing that is) means they're a fraud. As if a writer cannot use their imagination! And for Springsteen it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to imagine what his life would've been like if he hadn't got the rock 'n' roll bug. Because that was his family background, so yeah why wouldn't he sing about blue-collar working people? Now if he was from a well-to-do professional family that would be different (though surely even the middle classes might be allowed to use their imagination too?).Recommended especially for fans."
tt8716334,"I am NOT a Springsteen fan. Never cared much for his radio hits and never bought an album. This performance made me laugh, cry, and everything in-between. Made me feel nostalgic for my childhood. Made me reflect on my love for my dad and the moment when, near death from cancer, he expressed his apology for not having been a better dad. The talent and storytelling gifts manifested here were not at all what I expected. If you appreciate a true artist expressing from the heart, love live, raw music, piano, acoustic guitar, and harmonica intertwined with vivid storytelling that cuts to the heart, this show is for you. I won't soon forget this experience."
tt8716334,"A brilliant and intimate portrait of an essential American voice. The songs, the stories are all great and Springsteen inhabits the screen with such charisma and personality, that the show seems much too short.
Tremendously moving and inspiring."
tt8716334,"Springsteen, as a songwriter and author is carefully constructive with words, sentences, ideas, characters, consequences, and stories. His spoken content, when colored by instrumental piano or guitar musical accompaniment, elevates the moving and poetic to perfection. The songs are chosen for this audience as opposed to the arenas, and weave a story that while it is definitely all about Bruce, the kid who grows up to be a rock star, is also completely relatable to all because it's about mothers, fathers, family, fatherhood, purpose, and being American. I advise you to Listen carefully, pay attention to every word, every lyric, and every elicited emotion. This performance will resonate with me forever not just as a way to know Bruce's story, but to see the correlation to mine and everyone I know."
tt8716334,"Springsteen is more than his music. What other rock star could do this? The man is self made and did it the hard way. He is still unassuming, down to earth and sensitive.Now we know where the sadness from behind the eyes came from."
tt8716334,"I'm gonna keep this short!
I'm 24 years old and I have seen springsteen three Times in my life on the stage. He has hade a big influence on me, and saved me many Times! It's because of him I sing and play guitar and write songs.And this show, was simple amazing! Wish I could have been there live, but I live in Sweden and have no money so...
But I laught and cried, and never have 2 hours and 30 minutes gone by so fast. If you're a fan or not SEE IT!! How one man can have so mutch in him...Thank you Bruce for everything!
For making me belive that I could be more than what I am and that I could make my dreams come true...even though the probably never will..."
tt8716334,"It is not a show, it is like reading a 500 page novel which attracts you so much that you forget to sleep in order to read another chapter. Springsteen undoubtfully one of the most important american artists of all time, tells the epic story of the second half of 20th century in this touching, moody, expansive melodic show; so lay on your couch, and take a ride in time with music; and thank to universe that we are humans and we have artists like him who define their eras"
tt8716334,"Rationality is, as per usual, hard to find in these user reviews. It's always either a 1 or a 10, whereas the reality lies somewhere in between. People call it either a great masterpiece or a self-centered POS. Well, it is quite self-centered, but what do you expect out of a one man show?The thing is: Springsteen knows how to tell a story. As a European fan, I like the little travel capsule his music and this show give me into a regular American life that I sometimes dream of. This very much does that, diving into Bruce's youth, his parents and his hometown. It's standard Springsteen material and no matter how many times it's repeated, I still gobble it up. There's some real touching stories in there.Now the songs... I can't say I was a fan of the stripped down versions. I love me some acoustic, but this was different. The lyrics were there but the entire songs were changed to the point some were hard to recognize and it didn't really sit well with me for most. Tom Joad was nice and Brilliant Disguise was decent but those were really the only two where I didn't feel weirded out by how much the songs stray away from the flow and style of the originals. You could see this creative approach as positive, but to me it really wasn't.At 2.5 hours, it's a little on the long side and I caught myself yawning here and there, but all in all it manages to feel shorter than it is and it usually stays interesting enough with a decent mix of story and song.Conclusion: If you don't like Springsteen, this won't convince you. If you like Springsteen, you won't need convincing and you'll probably enjoy it."
tt8716334,"The Boss confesses himself in this wonderful, emotional, emotive, amazing spectacle. He talks -and sings- about his childhood, his love, his friends who are gone and who not, his father, his mother, his country. About everything that makes him be himself. And that's a lot. Two hours and a half to emotion, motivate you, to make you cry, of course, but also to make you laugh and to leave you a great feeling on the human being.Because, although he is the best, he is The Boss, he is, above all, a human being. He has problems, he cries, he prays, he feares himself... The only thing that makes him special is that he is able to tell us in an unique way. Please, whether you love or don't know Bruce Springsteen -I'm supposing everybody who knows him likes him- or not, please don't miss this magical journey through his life. You won't be disappointed."
tt8716334,"This is a great live concert to put on. I never realized how much of a charismatic storyteller Bruce Springsteen is. Much of the show is autobiographical monologues, interspersed with music. So, if you're just looking for some music, you're better off listening to an album."
tt8716334,"Completely not what I expected. An overly Introspective talkfest from Springsteen that his fans will undoubtedly love but the rest of us will have trouble listening to him for over two and a half hours talking of his life and playing songs ""unplugged"". He finishes with ""Born to Run"" as you've never heard it before. It just doesn't work because he's no balladeer. I've seen a similar show with Jimmy Barnes called ""Working Class Boy"" that is far more watchable than this. Unlike Springsteen, Barnes plays with a complete backing band. I think that's probably why ""On Broadway"" doesn't work for me.If you're one of his fans go for it, otherwise I cannot recommend it."
tt8716334,"...""That's how good I am.""
Couldn't agree more. As goes for this movie!"
tt8716334,I am not a total Springsteen devotee. I have a few of the more folkie albums but that's about it. So I approached this not knowing what to expect and I was blown away. The music is wonderful stripped back to the basic guitar or piano and voice. But that is only half of the charm. The linking narrative is spellbinding and for two and a half hours I was totally captivated. It is moving and fascinating and just a joyous affair. So even if you are not a big Bruce fan or even not a fan at all give this a try. You won't be disappointed
tt8716334,"It's for fans, sure it is, but specially for the ones who love good music with meaningfull lyrics, and not only the crap that is 90% of the music made today. this a genuine, true musician, that has songs with a message, with content, not only repeated lines all over.
I love his music, is message, and consider him one of the greatest american song writers of all time, a true and genuine performer...it will always be THE BOSS"
tt8716334,"A truly magical performance has you laughing, crying, made me happy, the man has played a big part in my life gets you through ups and downs with his music. Blessed to have seen this. Must watch!!!!!"
tt8716334,"A fan or not of BS this is an absolute MUST WATCH...make sure you watch it alone if your not fan of shedding tears in front of others because trust me your gonna feel EVERY emotion one can feel multiple times no doubt...if your from NJ ( Wildwood myself) theres so many awesome references & memories. Its like Bruce just sees life at a much higher level and is the best ive ever saw relay his memories/messages..last but not least myman maybe knocking on 70's door age wise but mentally,physically, and performance wise i cant imagine him being more on point EVER then he is on broadway..true master of his craft and a mutha fn legend whos done Southern NJ so proud..YOUR THE MAN SPRINGSTEEN!!!!!!"
tt8716334,"This performance simply blew me away! It had me laughing, crying, and touched me on very deep level. If you are a fan of his music or just appreciate the soul of artists/musician watch it."
tt8716334,"Of course his fans are lapping it up - he could play Yankee Doodle on a kazoo for two and a half hours and IMDB would be swamped with 10 star reviews. Some of his great songs survive the radical overhaul (Born in the USA is a casualty, turned into a belicose shouty blues number) but really, this was money for old rope. Overheads low, ticket sales exploitative. The monologues are sickly, schmaltzy and manipulative - basically chunks of his autobiography bellowed like a fairground barker. So for actual MUSIC fans (rather than people obsessed with celebrity) your choices are see him like this or as a dot on the horizon in some huge ballpark. It's a pity, because in there somewhere is a great musician."
tt8716334,"Simply beautiful.. Bruce reaches the heart and soul, fills them with that blissful feeling and such a positive energy which is really hard to describe.. That's why you gotta listen him sing, watch him smile and tell you a story with that good humor of his :) And then you smile. You just forget all the worries and trifles of everyday life and suddenly you are on a journey to that land of hopes and dreams with everything that really matters.. And guess what? Boss is driving :)"
tt8716334,"I've read a few reviews, critical reviews, stating ""boring unless you're a fan"" and ""for groupies""....Well, yeah. Obviously. It's superb. Why would you even watch if you're not a fan? Don't. It's not for you.It's for me. 10/10"
tt8716334,"From ""Growin' Up"" through to ""Land of Hope and Dreams"" Bruce Springsteen is enchanting, emotionally bare, and thoroughly captivating. Springsteen On Broadway is a landmark occasion, allowing Bruce to guide the audience through carefully selected chapters of his life that correspond with the music he has written across his entire career.The journey is a sprawling odyssey at over two and a half hours, but always intimate and engaging. It is also filmed in much the same way, always focused on the man as he shares the fears of his youth, his personal grief, and the legacy that pervades the paternal and guiding ancestral role he plays in our lives.This is essential for any Springsteen fan, but even non-fans will be converted after experiencing an eloquent and entertaining evening with a truly rare master of his craft."
tt8716334,This concert is stunning. What a man! He uncovers his hole life telling these stories between the songs. Saw him once in Stockolm in -81 and the concert lasted 4 hours with just one little break in the beginning of the show

tt9663460,"A bold step to sprout the intensity of forgiveness into an individual. Indeed, It may impact on every soul out there watching this! Mostly I liked the perception of the lady Kia Scherr, A victim of 26/11 mumbai attack, who lost her whole family - ""To be unforgiving is like taking poison and hoping your enemy dies. But we're the ones that have taken the poison""."
tt9663460,"An amazing set of true stories that show how every picture has two sides, and humanity is the only final solution there is."

Sad about the underwhelming response this gem received from television audience of our country. Media is flooded with reviews for many crap movies acted by so called heroes in the name of commercial cinema but could find only very few for this documentary even here in IMDB."
tt9663460,"You will cry, you will be emotionally drained, you will be internally shaken and you will learn forgiveness. Rubaru Roshni is a in one experience. One of the best movies on compassion ever made. Every single human being should watch it. ScreenplayS & editing is so precise that you get to know why Aamir Khan is the best story teller in India"
tt9663460,"Forgiveness is way above the self ego. Those people who forgives their enemies is just remarkable. I can't do this, I really appreciate who forgives their enemies. Hats off Amir Khan..this documentary teaches us so many things."
tt9663460,"A film for everyone. The hard hitting reality couldn't have been shown in a more graceful way.
A short film with a big lesson for humans - forgiveness is key to happiness.
With the current situation of increasing intolerance, this movie makes you think what is the fuss all about. Coz in the end, the culprit and the victim both suffer equally."
tt9663460,It helps a lot to improve yourself to develop a new world !!
tt9663460,"Wow Rubaru Roshni i have no words to describe how awesome this documentary is, but i can assure you it will definitely make you cry no matter how cold hearted u are........."
tt9663460,"Just watch, really it is hard to make such a big heart."
tt9663460,"A total tear-jerker.
This film brings three extraordinary story of forgiveness, repentance and humanity into the light. This film takes you in a different zone altogether. It happens very rarely that a film like this get made. Congratulations to the makers."
tt9663460,Rubaru Roshni is a documentary film by Amir khan productions which has telecasted on television for the first time. It has 3 real stories in different phases that can easily give you goosebumps for multiple times and tears. I really don't want to share the spoilers but  few thing i would like to explain that the theme of the movie is something which you never gonna believe or accept as an individual but it has actually happened (as it is a documentary) but it will change your mind set and the way you see worst thing in your life.
tt9663460,"A must watch. You are definitely touched by this movie. Violence and Forgiveness, has been narrated very well by those who experienced it themselves. You can definitely connect to the emotions of each and every character in this film."
tt9663460,"I actually came across this documentary on Hotstar and very frankly veived it because l believe Amir Khan would give me something worth watching. Honestly, this is one of the best films l have ever seen . I was most touched by the second story 'The farmer and the nun ' ; the farmer meeting his 'sister nun' every Rakhi and she welcoming him with all the 'riti & rivaz' . Nevertheless, the other two stories were equally appealing . I have no words to describe the pain these three beautiful ladies have undergone through .Thanks, Sir Amir Khan and of course the team responsible for this beautiful documentary . Above all ' THANK YOU GREAT LADIES TO FORGIVE THOSE WHO WERE NOT TO BE FORGIVED.'"
tt9663460,"What did we achieve with forgiving, after 9 years of 26/11 where 200 innocents were mercilessly killed now in Srilanka another 300+ families mourning and our only response should be forgiving? This movie shows the criminal mindsets elegantly and glorifies forgiving which can't be the only answer for what the victims have to go through. When will Aamir make movies about Islamic hatred being imbibed into young minds, when will Aamir make movie about reforming 6th century tribal barabric ideology?"
tt9663460,"In Rubaru Roshni , three stories are potraying that forgiveness can cost so much to the person concerned. A simple gesture towards life can change the world to such a great extent."
tt9663460,"A sensitive handling that does not pardon, bleach or understate the crime, but it makes forgiveness the hero and a desired emotion. 3 different stories, and it has so much to teach all of us."
tt9663460,A strong message is conveyed in this documentary. The world itself is a bitter place that doesn't mean you deserve to suffer your self or other human beings through the same bitterness & hatred. It's hard to forgive those who had Cause you pain but forgiveness is the only way you can overcome your pain & Live the Life for your Loved ones.
tt0112159,"Now I understand why people say this is the anime of animes. First don't watch this anime if you're not mature or 18+. There's also some epileptic and tripping parts that should be warned before watching. This is one of the darkest, most depressing and disturbing anime I've seen. After half episodes it becomes the real thing (hate,nudity,tools,betrayals for each character). The characters are likeable, the drawings are good and music is amazing, you can really see it's a 90's anime. But holy the Story is fkd up and disturbing. The last 2 episodes can be skipped if you don't want to see the perspective of Shinji. I agree that this is overrated but it's a great anime, that I don't recommend to children but adults."
tt0112159,"The last two original episodes are art, perfectly Could be museum pieces."
tt0112159,"This anime series is set fifteen years after a global disaster known as the Second Impact. It is centred on fourteen year old Shinji Ikari; he is summoned to the city of Tokyo-3 where he learns he has been chosen to pilot 'Evangelion Unit One'; to all intents and purposes a giant robot with biological components which can only be synchronised with pilots of a certain age. In Unit One Shinji will have to battle strange beings that have been dubbed 'Angels' whose arrival was foretold in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Shinji's job isn't helped by the fact that the Eva Project is run by his estranged father who seems more interested in Rei Ayanami, the slightly mysterious pilot of Eva Unit Zero. As the attacks continue a third pilot, Asuka Langley Soryu. Shinji always had issues but this work takes an emotional and psychological toll on him.One might expect this to be an exciting 'fighting robot' series but it quickly descends into existential angst and depression... a very interesting twist that I'm sure viewers who watched this series when it was new would have been shocked by. The central story is full of religious symbolism but it isn't overtly religious in a way that might offend or irritate viewers. The characters aren't that likeable; many, especially Shinji, come across as whiny and others, notably his father, as unpleasant and bullying. Things gets distinctly strange towards the end with two final episodes that are likely to leave some viewers exasperated; others will find this only adds to the sense that this series is something different. Normally I watch anime in Japanese with subtitles but as the dub was available on Netflix I watched that and thought the English voice cast did a solid job. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anime fans; it may show its age at times but it is still solid and had effects on many later series."
tt0112159,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is an anime that definitely marked a before and after in Japanese animation. Without a doubt, despite being released in the 90s, it is one of the biggest references in anime to date.Neon Genesis Evangelion, created by Hideaki Anno and produced by Gainax, is a seminal work in the landscape of anime and storytelling as a whole. Originally aired from 1995 to 1996, it has since become a cultural cornerstone, revered and dissected for its profound narrative depth, innovative animation, and explorations of existentialism, depression, and the human condition. This review aims to delve into the series' multifaceted aspects.At its core, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a story about teenagers piloting giant mechs known as Evangelions to combat mysterious beings called Angels. However, this synopsis simplifies a much more intricate narrative. The series explores deeply personal and psychological themes, reflecting the struggles of its characters, particularly Shinji Ikari, the reluctant protagonist. Shinji's journey is emblematic of adolescent angst, grappling with issues of self-worth, identity, and the burden of expectations.The show raises numerous philosophical questions: What does it mean to be human? How do we define our relationships with others? The ""Human Instrumentality Project,"" a central plot device, seeks to merge humanity into one consciousness, sparking debates about individuality versus collective existence.When talking about animation, during its 26 episodes it maintains its quality by giving first-rate animation both in the epic battles and when presenting the daily routine, even though they had a reduced budget in some chapters they were able to turn that limitation into a virtue, something which is mainly mentioned in the final 2 episodes.One of the series' strengths lies in its character development. Each character is intricately crafted, serving as a reflection of different facets of human experience. Asuka Langley Soryu, the fiery and competitive pilot, embodies the struggle for validation and the fear of vulnerability. Rei Ayanami, the enigmatic co-pilot, represents themes of identity and existential purpose. Misato Katsuragi, the operations director, juxtaposes the burdens of responsibility with personal desires, showcasing adult complexities.Through psychological crises and interpersonal conflicts, the characters evolve, making them relatable and compelling. The series portrays their fears, insecurities, and hopes, eliciting empathy from the audience.Neon Genesis Evangelion is Visually striking. The animation combines traditional techniques with innovative designs, particularly in the portrayal of the mechs and Angels. The stark contrasts between the serene moments of character introspection and the chaotic battles create a captivating visual dichotomy.Complementing the visuals is a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack composed by Shiro Sagisu. The score enhances emotional resonance, particularly in pivotal scenes, and the use of classical music blends with the narrative, enriching the viewer's experience.The ending of Evangelion is one of its most debated aspects. It is both thought-provoking and controversial, leaving viewers with a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty. Some find it satisfying, while others consider it confusing or unsatisfying.Neon Genesis Evangelion paved the way for anime to be recognized as a form of serious storytelling, pushing boundaries and challenging conventions. Its impact can be seen in contemporary anime that explores psychological and existential themes.Neon Genesis Evangelion is more than just a mecha anime; it's a complex exploration of the human psyche, societal pressures, and the quest for connection. Its ambitious narrative, rich character development, and innovative animation make it a timeless classic that resonates with viewers even decades after its release. For those willing to engage with its challenging themes, it offers a rewarding and thought-provoking experience that lingers long after the final episode."
tt0112159,I like the scenes of lonliness. It's beautifully done. It's a little bit similar to pacific rim movie. I couldn't understand any one the characters character.
tt0112159,"Absolute masterpiece (in my opinion). Shinji as a character is a fantastic portrayal of depression, isolation, escapism etc. And shows his struggles in a way where you can still relate to him. The final two episodes were absolutely incredible and even made me question myself as a person. Overall, it is not for everyone. Many people found this anime quite boring (and I can agree, it was slow at some parts, not to mention the unnecessary fanservice lol) but I really recommend it if you are looking for an interesting, thought-provoking anime."
tt0112159,"Low budget with a lot of static scenes, jumped straight to the ending because of lack of money and time, and never explained an important part of the plot like why do the angels attack.
But there it goes, the best anime ever created."
tt0112159,I still have mixed feelings about last 2 episodes but overall I think it is awesome anime with mature philosophical questions. Animation looks so good and colors are perfectly used. I still need to watch the End of Evangelion and I can't wait to see it.
tt0112159,"This artistic masterpiece is far superior to any anime or any animation that was made in the 1990s. It can easily hold up today.This anime is about a boy who is 'forced' to pilot a mecha after an Angel attack. With Nerv's mecha or as they are called Evangelion, they fight these strange monsters.This series is more than just your typical mecha anime. It is about loneliness and the meaning of life and lies. The animation is visually appealing. This is a must watch for anyone, anime fan or not,."
tt0112159,"""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", Hideaki Anno's magnum opus and a reflection of his depression at the time. Long have I heard of this legendary anime, but never felt the drive in giving it a try until recently. Is it worth it? Well, yes but in some ways no.Plot: Years after the apocalyptic event known as the 2nd Impact, the story concerns Shinji Ikari, a lonely boy who is suddenly summoned by his neglectful father Gendo, the head of the group called NERV. The reason: to pilot a mech called an Evangelion (Eva for short) to combat unusual creatures called Angels alongside brash Asuka and stoic Rei. Despite considerable reservations and low self-esteem, he agrees, going on a journey involving giant-sized battles, unnerving revelations, and a dive into others' inner demons.On the surface, this seems like a standard action series, but it's really a character study filled with religious parallels, psychological analyses, and sexual elements. Most of the major characters suffer from some shortcoming and have different ways of coping. My favorite is Misato, a woman who is both head of operations against Angels and Shinji's caretaker/mother figure; she shares common ground with him, is a risk taker, and has relatable flaws. Shinji, though, is a divisive figure as your enjoyment of the show depends on how much you invest in or even tolerate him. Having ""hedgehog's dilemma"" among others, he hesitates on things from fighting to getting close to anyone. While at times understandable, it does try one's patience (he's more tolerable after the first few episodes). There are scenes that offer levity with light-hearted moments, which I appreciate. While sometimes short, the battles alone are worth a watch with cool strategies, gruesome bloody violence, and a pantheon of monstrous Angels whose designs are as alien as their origins and motives. Outside the fights, though, the animation tends to be minimalistic. In fact, many scenes involve still shots that go on for too long, which bugged me. There's also no real explanation of why the Evas have to be piloted by 14-year olds and some side characters are written out in a way that doesn't feel conclusive.""Evangelion"" has two endings. First, the show's last 2 episodes are an abstract mind trip where the staff literally ran out of money and scraped together. The second is the movie ""End of Evangelion"", which is more grand and decisive, but also VERY trippy. Analyses from other people helped me understand the film, but it's not satisfying entertainment-wise. I'm curious about the remake ""Rebuild of Evangelion"", but that's for another time. While not for everyone, the anime certainly earned its reputation."
tt0112159,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is hailed as one of the greatest animes ever. As a mix of monster vs. Mecha action, character-driven psychological drama and conspiracy thriller, there's certainly plenty to delve into. Too bad the different elements never truly match with each other, and the result is possibly the grandmother of all ""mixed bags"".There are very many aspects of Evangelion to like, or at least to admire. The ambition of the series is unquestionable, telling a story which starts out as fairly simple mecha action, but then turning into something far more sinister and grand. The designs of the Angels and Evas are still very imaginative and original and each battle provides a different scenario. The Angels are among one of the most genuinely alien-feeling creatures I've seen in fiction overall. The boldness it takes to put the characters into such dark places as they are in the end is very admirable, as the second season provides disturbing imagery all the way through. The characters are fairly deep with complex relationships, and the scenario of humanity trying to survive, but possibly heading double-time towards extinction is interesting. And the effort it must have taken to put together a story with so many different elements deserves a clapping.But where to begin with the problems, which sadly far outweigh the good elements? -The tone is very inconsistent, starting out with a mysterious feel with some heavy drama and then settling into a comfortable, fairly light-hearted monster-action period. During the second season the series plunges all the way into thorough unpleasantness before finally crapping out altogether and being left wallowing in psychedelic imagery and dialogue.-With such a grand story to tell, Evangelion should be a series with absolutely zero filler, yet there are at least three to five episodes out of 26 which have no relevance at all in terms of the main story-Nearly all the characters are almost completely unlikable. Despite this probably being one of the main points, as the series turns into full- fledged tragedy during the last 10 or so episodes, they seem neither to feel genuine sympathy for each other nor really care much about anything other than themselves. Character traits which are introduced as quirks or comedic elements (like Misato's drinking) later become sources of self-loathing and disgust. One particular central character and their own subplot is squandered so badly in terms of dramatic potential it's almost insulting.-The animation quality sees a steep drop after episode 19. This was later somewhat redeemed in the director's cut versions, but the lack of budget towards the end is still painfully obvious. Many scenes feature little more than static images with voiceovers, and at times feel more like a power point presentation instead of animation.There are dozens of oddities and illogicalities that constantly have the viewer thinking ""How did they do that?"". For example, we never see how the various parts of NERV HQ are placed in relation to each other. For all we know, all the various rooms and halls could exist entirely in small pocket dimensions of their own.-Despite their heavy presence, the biblical imagery and names are pure surface, and nowadays feel pretentious rather than original. You could replace all the names with Godzilla, Mothra, King Kong and such and it'd still be the same story.-A large amount of screen time is taken up by meaningless techno-babble, which serves next to no purpose. There are also some weird dialogues and monologues that pop out of nowhere and seem to have been written by someone tripping on acid. The infamous last 2 episodes are so full of esoteric philosophical mush that it feels like a completely different series. Whether this was the creator's intention or not I won't theorize on, it simply doesn't work.-The very heavy presence of angst both teen and mature can be quite grating, even for a series about psychological problems and mental breakdown. Even the adult characters fall into the pit of constant self-loathing towards the end.-Despite it being constantly referred to and being one of the central plot elements of the entire series, the Human Instrumentality Project never seems to be what's driving the story. Also the vast amount of lore involving the Second Impact, SEELE and NERV is almost all dumped into a single episode, instead of being slowly unearthed. It could have been used to create mystery, but as it stands it creates merely confusion and dissatisfaction.To list more would be just nit-picking, but there are plenty more. The end result is a series that is at times excellent, but most of the time just irritating or dull to watch.Recommendation: Evangelion is possibly one of the most divisive works of fiction ever created. Anyone who hasn't seen this series but has an interest in it should watch it just to form an opinion of their own."
tt0112159,"Well, what can I say about a series that's as absolutely mind-blowing as the 26 episodes and two movies that make up Neon Genesis Evangelion?  This is, quite simply, a masterpiece.  What starts out as a simple ""save the world"" mecha story evolves into a shocking and powerful psychological drama full of conspiracy, dysfunctional characters, and some of the most harrowingly emotional and painful fight scenes ever.  Don't let the first several episodes fool you- they're entertaining enough, but the power of the series remains hidden.When I popped in the first video, I was excited to see a new anime, but otherwise pretty relaxed.  By the end of episode 18 or so, my heart was racing, and I was nearly in tears.  It never let up after that.  This is not just an anime.  This is an experience."
tt0112159,"When I was a teen, I was only a 6th grader and was new to school. I made many great friends that I'm still close friends with them today. I thought my life was wonderful as a 6th grader and in peace. Until I met my first crush, an 8th grader who's a few years older than me. I start to panic in fear of losing her and never seeing her again. Of course I told my friends about my secret crush and they did the try-not-to-laugh-out-loud grin onto me and I handled that easily. I decided that on Valentine's Day, I would confess to her about my love. Everyday, when I leave school, I would always look back in case if she ever looks back at me. Luckily, we both loved anime and we weren't complete strangers to each other although we didn't talk that much. On Valentine's Day, I gather up my strength and decided to wait for her and give her my valentine's lollipop I found on the floor and I told her about it. She at first didn't know how to tackle it, she then said sorry and said that I was handsome and we never said a word to each other again. We were quite embarrassed and I didn't want to cause her any more trouble. I never cried in my life but I started to have these strange thoughts in my mind. I would often think what she said on that day and I often felt that the nice compliment she told me about being handsome was just to cheer me up. I also wasn't much of a talker and my older sister would often get mad at me for saying nothing and looking so bored or depressed look all the time even though I wasn't. I also thought that I helped her or at least do more for her and I often try to forget her. That day has pushed me and I don't want any insults or any bad ideas when I'm talking about this because I learned to love life as it is. The strange feeling that I had for the rest of 6th grade was depression. A feeling so strong it would make you feel like trash from the bottom core of the Earth, a useless creature born to work until you die. ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" is a deep analysis on depression and it's more haunting and powerful than any other tv show or movie in years.""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", first released as a tv show in 1995, would be later create an entire franchise of this with 6 movies, (one currently in development) several spinoffs that is only to please those who are addicted into the girl characters which I admit they weren't that good, and a few games included. The franchise also included a big collaboration with ""Godzilla"" as Hideaki Anno, the creator of the series, also created ""Shin Godzilla"" or ""Godzilla Resurgence"". This franchise is one of the biggest influences on Japanese pop culture alongside ""One Piece"", ""Godzilla"", and other popular icons like Hatsune Miku and ""Doraemon"". ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" is a 26 episode show of a young 14 year old kid forced to fight against monsters alongside his students like Rei Ayanami and Asuka Langley Soryu. A story that sounds like a normal mecha anime but when viewed closely and paying attention to the details you can see that it's more than just a robot kills the Decepticons for the 100th time. Evangelion's entire storyline uses emotions as the base for keeping the storyline stable. If you known people who watched Evangelion and if they say that it's depressing, you should be trust them on that. Story is something a Game of Thrones fan would have, a complex and completely confusing timeline of events that would often make you rewatching this show on and on until you'll be screaming on the floor. Is it worth it? Definitely. Something way more interesting than your usual Naruto storyline. A story filled with humor and mental breakdowns. A story that still scares the viewers and wanting the viewers to watch more of it. Eventually, you'll learn a lot about life than just watching anime from this show. A show that can be a little comedic and a little hard to handle with the fan service but aside little pebbles of fan service, Hideaki Anno still delivers his message with unspeakable precision, breaking the barriers of happiness.The show isn't just powerful for the stories and messages but also with several clever directing tricks that'll amaze you when you first watch it. An interesting thing about anime is that anime often has the background moving and the action while the camera stays in motion. Anno finds a brilliant solution to move the camera without moving the background or doing the action. Instead, he gets his animators to draw out the entire background so the only things that move are the characters and the camera can move on it's own without having a black and unexpected border of nothing. The use of eyes in the show also can develop more shock to the audiences when it comes to surprise reactions. ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" also manages to capture the feeling of loneliness or depression with a surreal and unexpected visuals. Keep in mind that Hideaki Anno himself also has experienced depression a lot when it came to keeping his original artistic vision. (This also happened to Miyazaki often) Making a powerful piece of work is certainly not easy to construct as it often pushes your limits and what you know. It is a dangerous thing to do and sometimes it will require sacrifice of time for your friends or family. Hideaki Anno often puts thought-provoking questions and a few seconds of random frames from a few episodes and often put a lot of scribbles to describe the mental breakdown of a character. Often putting the color red in the mental breakdown's to make it a lot more violent and unnerving to handle. He also does put a few parts where a character is often talking to themselves or someone talking in their minds, asking them questions on their reality and the will to live longer in that reality.As haunting as it was 24 years ago, ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" finally gotten it's first debut onto digital and many fans are disappointed with a few changes that Netflix made, mostly the subtitle corrections and the change of outro. I'm not too big on subtitles and even if they sound ridiculously stupid at times, I can tackle it. However, the change of outro music is something that I think is a major problem with not just Netflix but with the overall show. The original version was a cover on ""Fly Me to the Moon"" by Bart Howards and not Frank Sinatra. The new ending plays ""Rei I"", a song from the original soundtrack for the show and can often be heard at times, most famously on the episode, ""Rei I"" (Episode 5). The sudden change in atmosphere from calm and relaxing for viewers to inhale as they go on to the next episode, to the uncomfortable and creepy music that give the newcomers little to no space to breathe between episodes. This big change is a major problem because of not because everyone loves ""Fly Me to the Moon"" better than ""Rei I"" but that it also changes the atmosphere entirely to the polar opposite of what Anno intended to make. Now this problem can be solved by watching Netflix Japan which I'm sure you guys know how to do or you can go buy bootlegs or buy the entire series for $400 on Amazon just for a used one. Why did Netflix do this? Evangelion is not a big franchise to them, only a quick buck for them to make and the special covers for ""Fly Me to the Moon"" (Each episode had a different cover for this song, with/without strings, sung by the voice actress of Rei/Asuka, etc. There were also a few changes on the DVD too for these covers) are owned by a separate company. If you haven't known, licensing is a pure nightmare fuel when it comes to getting what you want. Netflix had to deal with this for years as I'm sure and they do not want to spend another million dollars on a few covers for a song that's used for a show that they're not even sure if the show is going to be a big hit instead of a bad miss. I could understand that but it's a pure shame that this had to happen.Even through these several problems/controversies, ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" still manages to outshine several other animes and series in Japanese pop culture. Bringing this underrated gem back for viewing for everyone has it's pros/cons. Luckily, it's more on the pro side in my opinion but for real die-hard-fans-who-would-die-for-their-waifus will definitely have millions of problems with the new Netflix edit of this show. (No cuts were made, just a few adjustments with outro and subtitling. Also English Dub has also been criticized too but I didn't hear it. Sorry for those who were curious about that.) In the end, I don't care about whatever Netflix did to butcher this as people would say, I only care about the fact that the message is still strong and clear to me and audiences today. A must-watch for any anime fans. People who aren't fans of anime, beware, you may have to take inhale a few awkward moments here and there but it's still worth watching. This show is definitely for everyone and is highly recommended to watch it slowly and not all in one day. The ending for this show can feel a little raw and uncooked for a good ending but look no further than ""End of Evangelion"", Anno's true ending to his visually expressive masterpiece. ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" is what created modern anime today and dare I say, one of the best TV Shows I've seen.
10/10"
tt0112159,"Neon Genesis Evangelion has been mentioned in the same sentence as 2001: A Space Odyssey many times, which is my favorite film of all time. So as soon as it was on Netflix I put it on and binged the entire series and I have no words. It morphs from a mecha anime to a psychological horror to downright euphoria. The final two episodes are polarizing for viewers, and I'm on the positive side. What was initially just a quick ending to the series because of financial issues is now the most mind-boggling, psychologically damaging conclusion to any show I've ever seen. A masterpiece of a show, for sure."
tt0112159,"Made me genuinely cry, evangelion gathers the deepest horrors of the human mind and trowns them to the air"
tt0112159,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is the best work of fiction I have had the good fortune to encounter in my life, and it is no exaggeration for me to claim that it has changed it for me irrevocably. This review is therefore just a small way of sending my thanks to the beautiful mind that created it, Hideaki Anno.The analyses, forums, chats, and discussions related to this anime are not wasted, and the number of lessons and interpretations that can be drawn from it is endless.The only thing I can remark again, is how incredible it is that such a work, especially the final episodes of this wonderful series (arising moreover from production difficulties, and because of that structured in such an unconventional way), are able to speak to the inner depths of thousands of people, and, in so many cases, making us feel understood, worthy, accepted, and so full of hope."
tt0112159,The final two episodes left a bigger impact on me any other ending I've ever seen. A spiritual experience.
tt0112159,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is, without a doubt, the most popular anime of all time. People can't go two sentences without praising how profound and impacting it is, how deep and well thought out it is, how painfully realistic the characters are and what a religious experience it was for them... ... ... Shut up! Please! I can clearly see why this anime is popular, but that doesn't make the reason any less stupid. Now don't get me wrong, I like this anime. Really, I do. But it's so overrated the ''Matrix''-trilogy fails in comparison. And that says a lot.This anime is not ''profound'', ''intelligent'', ''deep'' or any other word of praise ever given to it. Nor is it realistic. The characters were all two-dimensional and oftentimes annoying, not to mention boring. The plot is supposed to be intelligent, but is nothing more than a bunch of incomprehensible blabber. The animation is nothing special, the music is mediocre and the ending is simply not fulfilling.Then why is it so popular? Simple... This anime might not be deep or profound or anything, nor are the characters realistic... But the creators did a damn good job making it SEEM like it is. Simply by creating an anime almost opposite of what you've seen before. You can't deny Evangelion's plot and characters were completely different as anything seen in most anime, at that time. Therefore people immediately embraced it as ''realistic'', because of the simple fact that most of these other anime weren't, and this one had to be. The creators pull it further by throwing in countless of pointless religious references and cliched psycho-babble, and it was immediately dubbed brilliant.But none of these religious references mean anything, or stand for anything. None of these characters are realistic... Unless you call people suffering in the worst ways imaginable, with the exact same behaviour at all times, without the slightest sign of development nor change in speech or mood, realistic. I know I don't. I admit the characters are original, at least, but realistic or ''deep'', my ass.What does this psycho-babble mean? Nothing. It all sounds like phrases taken from one of Freud's textbooks and randomly scattered throughout the series, once again seemingly meaning something, while it doesn't even serve a purpose. (Despite reminding us once again how unrealistic these characters are)Quite frankly, there's nothing deep, profound, intelligent or realistic about Evangelion. When it comes down to it, it's a gigantic show of vagueness. Then why do I like it? I love vague stuff. I really enjoy watching EVA and then trying to fill in the pieces for myself. I like it gives me something to think about. But it's so horribly overrated it's annoying to hear people praise it again, in the exact same way as everyone else does, with the exact same tone and words. This almost ruins it for me.Guys... Get a grip, please. It doesn't interest me anymore to hear how ''deep'' you thought this series, because it's quite clear to me now that it isn't. Stop praising this series in the same, bland way, over and over again. We got the picture. You were fooled by the creators to believe something that wasn't there. Along with all the other thousands. It means nothing."
tt0112159,"Contrary to most other commentators, I deeply hate this series.It starts out looking interesting, with mysterious aliens and giant robots, and I kept my hopes up until the very last episode. At the end of it, I still didn't understand what the alien attacks were all about (maybe I missed something, who knows?), and realized that I had sat through 26 episodes consisting mainly of the characters' own self-hating, selfishness and self-pitying. It actually flips between alien/robot fights and these dark, depressing blinking-on-and-off scenes where one or more characters shouts ""I hate me/you/it"" 10-12 times in a row.I can't really see either Shinji or Asuka (two of the main characters) showing growth or change. (Nor can I see any of the other characters learning or growing either, for that matter.) I wanted to kick them and tell them to get a bloody life during the first episodes, and the feeling didn't change during the last ones. Shinji truly possesses the kind of helpless hopelessness that makes people angry rather than charitable, and Asuka is such an infuriating know-it-all that I wanted to smash the TV screen every time she came into view. Oh, and more than anyone else, these two hate everything, and say it veeeeeeeery often. Shinji even makes a half-assed attempt at suicide. Please, explain to me why I should give a rat's ass about this animé, when even it's characters are trying to off themselves to get out of it.I'm otherwise a big fan of animé and manga, and never before have I disliked one so much. I read that the series creator/writer wrote this while suffering from a depression, and I can believe that; it made me depressed to watch it. Is that the aim of this series? I'm honestly asking. Is it designed to make the viewer confused and annoyed? And if suffering from a depression, why just not write a book or biography about it, instead of mixing it up with aliens and mecha's? This alien war plot, as far as I could tell, lead to absolutely nowhere.Finally, since I'm truly fascinated by how many people claim to love this patchwork of dead-end plots, I can't help but wonder how many of them actually find it good, and how many say they do because they've been told it is."
tt0112159,"Whether you enjoy the world of anime or not this is an experience you must have before you die. Nothing else in the world is like it. For the sake of your personal experience I cannot tell you much about it and here's why. The first 20 some episodes you are immersed in the semi-futuristic world of Tokyo 3 and the characters are developed beautifully, some of the best character development I've ever witnessed. You get a very very good feel for the world and the situation they live in, only to have that blown away in the final episodes. Please for the sake of yourself watch this, from the start, you will not regret it.Hideaki Anno has conceived of a story more important to my life than any other.Hideaki Anno is pure genius."
tt0487831,"This is truly a comedy of pure genius. All the elements involved are spot on, and combine to make a show of pure brilliance. Brilliant scripts, wonderfully acted, the mix of Chris O'Dowd, Richard Ayoade and Katherine Parkinson combine outrageously well. Huge credit to Graham Linehan too, previously successful with Father Ted and Black Books his pedigree is there for all to see. The out and out funniest episode in my humble opinion had to be The work outing, which I can watch again and again and still be belly laughing, it's immense, other top quality episodes include The Speech, Calamity Jen and finale The internet is coming. Very few dips in quality.What a shame it had to finish, this was gold. 10/10"
tt0487831,"I think it has just the right amount of tech humor to stay true to its name, but anybody who's ever worked in an office of any kind should appreciate this show hugely. Big laughs for me every single episode... and I don't ususally laugh outloud. ""Others"" in the house made the comment of me really enjoying myself watching these crazy episodes. I've loved every episode through 5, though to be perfectly honest here and there I found myself wishing for more techie jokes, but i guess they can't chase away the non-techies just yet.Personally, Moss is my fav. The voice, the look, his whole line of thinking. Way cool and ridiculous. Happily, all the other characters are top notch too. Very very refreshing and laugh outloud show. Don't miss it!"
tt0487831,"For those who complain that ""The Big Bang Theory"" is too artificial and panders to mainstream audiences, there's a fantastic option for getting your geek/comedy fix in the U.K.'s ""The IT Crowd"". The sitcom, from writer/director Graham Linehan, is one of the funniest shows I've ever watched. In my opinion, sitcoms have always been a cheap form of laughs that cater to the lowest common denominator with themes reused over and over again for the same gags. But this one felt genuine and original with a fun twist on common life foibles as seen through the eyes of two antisocial computer techs toiling away in the basement of a major corporation. We introduced to their world in the beginning with the arrival of Jen Barber (Katherine Parkinson) when she's hired as the manager of Reynholm Industries' IT department. A computer- illiterate woman intent on faking her way to success, she meets Roy Trenneman (Chris O'Dowd) and Maurice Moss (Richard Ayoade): the company's crack IT team. Over the course of four series (and a total of 25 episodes), the three of them will endure everything from cannibalism to viral menstruation as they attempt to break out of their sheltered world and, you know, do things grown adults are supposed to do. The show has a fun balance of humor that will appeal to the more geek-centric viewers while keeping most of it broad enough that anyone can find something hilarious. This show is everything I'm pretty sure ""The Big Bang Theory"" wanted to be.What makes ""The IT Crowd"" so much fun? The characters. I freakin' love the characters in this show. All of them. The show manages to keep the roster down to a manageable four (five, when Richmond is around) to give each plenty of screen time for us to get to know them. Roy is the IT team's more socialmember, and that's not saying much. He has a general hatred for the common populace (which I can get behind) and finds most people to be blithering idiots, but he's also a lech who uses his position to try and troll the upper floors of the building for his next hot (unsuccessful) date. Chris O'Dowd (who I'd only previously seen in BRIDESMAIDS) injects the character with the perfect level of charm and exasperation. The fan favorite of the show is Moss and his endless list of eccentricities. He's a more prototypical nerd: hyper-intelligent, naïve, and utterly inept when thrust into social situations. He's the sort who'll faint at the thought of a woman opening discussing her unmentionables or find a website to aid in engaging in casual conversation with sport fans. Richard Ayoade is perfect in the role. Every time Moss is on screen, you can bet the best laughs will come from him. Fun fact: Ayoade was the only cast member to be ported over to the States to star in the American version and even he couldn't save the unused pilot from becoming an inferior copycat of the original that saw a fast, merciful death before reaching air. The final member of the IT crew is Jen. She's the ""normal"" one. She's got no computer experience (outside of checking her email) and she can actually engage in personal relationships. She's a manipulative go-getter who initially hopes her management role in the IT department could lead to bigger and better things. As Jen, Katherine Parkinson is the audience's vessel into this absurd show and the best moments are when it becomes apparent that she's become ingrained in the world of geek culture. The final character (or characters, I guess, since we went through two over the course of the show) is the big boss of Reynholm Industries. The first series featured Chris Morris as Deynholm Reynholm, a hyperactive man with a few screws missing and a passion for motivating his workforce. I honestly can't find the words to describe Morris's bizarre line deliveries and the quirks he brings to the character but they're awesome. Morris was with the show until the beginning of the second series when Matt Berry stepped in to run the company as Douglas Reynholm and we got a whole new level of insane. Rather than ape what made Morris's character of Reynholm so fun, Berry's Douglas is sexist (renowned for his collection of sexual harassment suits), melodramatic, and a total buffoon. While I can understand why people seem to love the character of Moss the most, I'm honestly torn between Moss and Douglas Reynholm as my favorite character in the series.""The IT Crowd"" is more than just it's fantastic characters. I was also impressed that its plot lines never seem to retread old sitcom ground. Each of the episodes felt more original than you're average TV comedy. Granted, most of the episodes are focused on the same thing: the IT crowd attempts to integrate/interact with normal people and it goes horribly wrong. The IT crew is invited to a dinner party at Jen's flat when her usual guests were unavailable. Roy establishes a bogus dating site profile to win a bet against Jen and prove that women only want bad boys. Moss and Roy become friends with a group of ""real men"" and bond over soccer, beer, and armed robbery. It's a common thread in the series, but it's not their only trick. Graham Linehan has got enough material that it kept the series fresh over the course of its four-series run. If I had to choose a personal favorite, I would agree with a good portion of it's fan- base and go with ""The Speech"", wherein Jen is award the title of Employee of the Month and must give a speech on technology to the company's shareholders. When Jen's ego inflates and the boys decide to have a little harmless fun with her acceptance speech, it'swellit's just perfect. I can't recommend this show enough and only wish that it would've continued on longer than it did. Four series just wasn't enough."
tt0487831,"this show is like the British version of seinfeld for the it lovers, extremely intelligent, well written and most importantly well acted. The actor who stands out is def Richard Ayoade, explosive performance. Although 10 stars, i think people ages 17-40 might like the show better, than older or younger crowds, because of the intelligence of comedic tones, and also the it parts. The first episode, might be hard to understand for Americans, because of the British English vs American English, but by video two, it takes you to it's world. Work place, co- workers. overall, this show hits between left and right in comedy, between two intelligent guys, and a co-worker, with barely any It knowledge who's an idiot at IT but brilliant at people, and IT guys, that are brilliant at IT but idiots with people. I love the automated phone message, to shut off and restart the computer, is a classic. Hilarious."
tt0487831,"This time, he's dealing with technology. The IT Crowd, with it's old-skool computer game style opening credits, immediately catches the attention.Roy and Moss are two IT staff working for a big company. But despite the size of the company, the two seem banished to the basement of the building. However, they seem to enjoy their locked-away existence, occasionally being tortured by moronic staff asking why their computer won't work, which is usually answered with, ""Have you tried turning it off and on again?"" The characters are likable, and the script is a joy. Further proof that Mr. Linehan has a good eye for great actors and actresses, and that his writing skills have not waned with time. After all of his previous successes (including Father Ted, Black Books and material for Harry Enfield And Chums, The Fast Show, Big Train, Coogan's Run, Brass Eye and Jam) The IT Crowd is another triumph."
tt0487831,"If you wanna laugh out loud, watch The IT Crowd. It's one of my favorite TV Shows that I've enjoyed most watching. It's about two nerd that work as IT in a large corporation. They're surrounded with dumb people, and that's what makes it funny. A new department chief comes. A girl that has no idea with computers.The cast is great, Richard Ayoade as Moss is in my top 5 characters that made me laugh most. Also other characters are funny as well. There are no jokes at all. The dialogue is funny itself, the characters are funny in the way they talk, act and the way they live.I'm not a guy who re-watch TV shows. But this case, I'm sure that I'm gonna watch again IT Crowd."
tt0487831,"I never meant to watch The IT Crowd, I stumbled upon it by accident when I was at a friends house and I decided to watch it as there was nothing else on and boy was I glad to have watched it! It was so funny, you must admire the emergency services scene! it was a total shame to have only 6 episodes in the 1 series! I hope series 2 comes out soon because this is by far the best series i have ever watched and will be my all-time favourite TV show ever! Moss is a great character and definitely suits the program well as his witty funny lines fits everywhere they are mentioned! ""If there were such a thing as a drudgeon, that is what we'd be to them."" Class ;) The IT Crowd is A perfect 10/10 a must see."
tt0487831,"Considering the brain dead material on TV these days, including all the ""reality TV"" garbage, The IT Crowd is probably the best show to come along in a very long time. The characters are well developed, the humour is dry and witty and the cast is amazing. There are so many nuances that you have to pay special attention or you'll miss them, which is difficult to do when you are busting your gut laughing with tears pouring down your face. You have to watch the episodes several times to get it all and each time you howl with anticipation of what you know is coming up next. Favourite parts have to be the tarty red shouza (shoes) and when Roy has to explain to Moss about ""High Tide"" - First scene of Carrie Moss. Richmond is OTT. Brilliant. Can't wait to see series 2."
tt0487831,"""The IT crowd"" is an excellent comedy but requires the viewer to watch the second episode rather than base their judgement on the first episode then snub the entire series.The first episode was a decent attempt to gain the viewers approval however, it was hyped far too much, which made the viewer think that ""The IT Crowd"" was the next best comedy. When the first episode ended, everyone was disappointed due to the lack of good jokes. There were moments in the first episode that somehow reminded me of the great mind of Graham Linehan who was the writer to ""Father Ted"" and ""Black Books"" due to random jokes such as the joke in the credits.The second episode was almost redemption to the first as the cast and Graham Linehan ultimately revealed their true performance. It was almost surreal and had it's connections to ""Father Ted"" equally weirdness. There was uncontrollable laughter in a lot of areas of the second episode such as the stress class which delivered powerful comedy that would even make ""Father Ted"" mediocre.I give this comedy a round of applause and wish for an encore."
tt0487831,"My new all time favorite show. Expertly performed and brilliantly written this is the funniest show I have seen for as long as I can remember. The cast is so perfect, from the nutty Denholm (the boss man) to the eclectic pair of nerds that was the IT department. I am so lucky to have seen an episode on the net, because I would have never seen this on the BBC as I live in the US. You do not have to be a computer nerd to laugh until your sides hurt. However, having any exposure to life inside a company of any modest size will certainly make you appreciate what goes on at this company. Even the elevator, or ""lift"" as the Brits call it is a source of much laughter, as are the bathrooms and many other props. But the real genius of such great writing and comedic delivery on the part of the cast is magnificent. Please continue to make more, and pretty please produce a DVD that I can buy on Amazon."
tt0487831,"I actually gave up after the first episode. A couple of months later I decided to keep watching since so many people are raving about this show.I can't say I particularly enjoyed the first season. Then enter Matt Berry as Douglas Reynholm in the second season. Boy am I glad I kept watching. The overall quality of the scripts increased with time. The show itself isn't much more than OK, but the scenes with Matt Berry elevates it to a whole other level. He steals every scene that he's in. I can't remember seeing him in anything before or after this, but what a fantastic performance he delivers in The IT Crowd."
tt0487831,"The IT Crowd is an absurdist satire of office dramas, featuring those most indispensable of nerds, tech support geeks.The first thing I noticed watching this series was director Ben Fuller's patience. He has a willingness to let a joke build that evades most television directors. Some jokes are set up in the opening scene and wait until the final segment for the payoff.The show is further bolstered by great chemistry and timing between stars Richard Ayoade, Christopher Morris, Chris O'Dowd, and Katherine Parkinson. Each actor emits a brave willingness to take their characters to extremes for a laugh.It's all helped a great deal, of course, if you have a vague notion computer technology and its various sub-cultures, but for the most part, the audience is along for clever dialogue-related humour, not in-jokes."
tt0487831,"Roy (Chris O'Dowd) and Moss (Richard Ayoade) are the downtrodden and underappreciated IT department at Denholm Industries. Much to their disappointment, they are allocated Jen (Katherine Parkinson) as new team leader. Jen doesn't know a thing about I.T (even what the letters stand for ) but they do share all share a healthy distaste for actual work and their basement becomes a refuge from the increasing absurdity of corporate culture. I didn't watch ""The IT Crowd"" when it initially aired on Chanel 4, but I have recently watched through all the episodes on Netflix. I found it amusing, rather than hilarious. The characters are excellent but the writing is sometimes a bit heavy handed, which is a contrast to the subtlety of ""Father Ted"" and ""Black Books"". It's a shame that Noel Fielding wasn't able to contribute more to the series than he did, but given that he was away working on ""The Mighty Boosh"" it's understandable. As some others have said, the first episode isn't the best, so you'll have to watch a few before deciding if it's for you - the second and third seasons are the highlights, but the dip in quality as it winds down isn't particularly pronounced, though the finale special is somewhat a ""Greatest Hits"" retread. Some of it hasn't aged well, both in terms of contemporary references from the time and jokes about for example, predatory male bosses, but there's always at least one delivery or moment that makes me laugh, and the ""Countdown"" episode is phenomenal. As the run continues the show moves away from making fun of the office environment to tackle bigger and more obvious targets like Scientology or viral Videos, which again isn't really to the shows improvement. It's not top drawer comedy, like ""Spaced"" or ""Father Ted"" but it's a decent enough way to spend a few hours."
tt0487831,"After The Office and Extras revitalised British comedy, and after the success of disturbing Chris Morris works; BrassEye and Jam, The I.T. Crowd is a lofty step backwards for all involved. Morris, Noel Fielding, Richard Ayoade and Matt Berry have all been far better elsewhere. And while Graham Linehan's sentimental sitcom leanings roped in his surrealist writing partner, Arthur Mathews, to make Father Ted a genuine classic, without Mathews, Linehan is free to indulge in the sub-FRIENDS/Seinfeld sitcom he was always in danger of making. It fact, writing is so hackneyed and predictable that the series feels like a real life version of When The Whistle Blows.Graham Linehan said that I.T. was fertile comedy ground that no one else had cottoned on to. He used the analogy of a bag of money sitting in the center of the room which nobody had noticed and picked up. It never occurred to him that smarter minds than his had passed on the opportunity for a reason. Several in fact. Computers aren't interesting, office based comedy is obsolete after The Office, sitcoms are dead, everyone hates audience laughter (he insists that it is filmed in front of a live studio audience, but really, who cares! It's awful!) etc etc. Characters are broad and one dimensional, you can see the jokes coming, and there are only two standing sets. The majority of on screen antics take place in a grotty basement set, decorated to resemble a teenager's bedroom. Roy (the obligatory Irishman, certainly no Dylan Moran or Dermot Morgan) and his cohort Moss are played as children as adults. The 'catchphrase' ""Are you 'aving a laug..."" I mean, ""Have you tried turning it off and on?"" is about as far as the show delves into Information Technology. Jen the arbitrary female, and broad failed professional woman stereotype (obsessed with shoes, long suffering in a quest to find a man) is proof (if any were needed) that Graham can't write female parts. Expect many scenes where Jen laments her life while Roy plays video games.There are a few episodes that exceed the suffocating s(h)itcom format, and are funny, even quotable. But as the characters are stock, there is no room for any development or investment. Being British means that it is able to push things further than the American dross it apes, at times excel past it, but that really isn't saying much. The cast are more than competent, and do their best with what little they are given. It's a crying shame that Linehan didn't apply these scenarios and actors to another series of Big Train. And that Chris Morris didn't pen Nathan Barley earlier."
tt0487831,"This series is so good. The cast is wonderful and it made me laugh and cackle in a way that I haven't too often. Really good stuff. I love the reality of all of the wires and all of the keyboards around... etc. The mess of the place/office is heartwarming - and the randomness of the ""relationship manager"" is really funny. The show has a 70's look to it - It kind of looks like my old shows growing up, like the Jeffersons - so it has this feel to it like there is some kind of art going on.Brits rock.The show is hilarious at times, and I don't just throw that word around. :-)"
tt0487831,"Bloody Brilliant! I didn't even know they added another episode and gave us an official ending to this masterpiece. There are so many things I love about this series. What trips me out is how it keeps getting progressively better with each episode. Seriously, some of the last few episodes are nearly lethal gut-busters. The final episode they tacked on after a few years isn't as funny as the rest of the series but it was nice of them to give it to us. Some of the jokes are dated but work well regardless. In about 100 years from now, this television series will be used as educational material for what mankind was like at the start of IT becoming mainstream."
tt0487831,"Jen Barber is promoted to head the IT department of a large corporation. Problem is: she knows nothing about IT. Her staff, Roy and Moss, have no social skills. They make a perfect team.Incredibly funny. Clever and over-the-top in a Pythonesque sort of way, yet very relatable to anyone who has ever worked in large corporation and had to deal with IT. Contains some highly memorable and iconic skits, e.g. the Internet in a box, Jen the Italian translator.Great work by Katherine Parkinson, Chris O'Dowd and Richard Ayoade in the lead roles. The series is made, however, by Matt Berry as the over-the-top CEO, Douglas Reynholm. He joined in Season 2 and things immediately kicked up a gear. Not that his predecessor, Christopher Morris (playing his father), was weak in the role. On the contrary, he was very good and created the zany blueprint for Berry's character. It's just that Berry turned the amp all the way up to 11 in very impressive style.Brilliant."
tt0487831,"Each episode well written, performances by Katharine Parkinson (Jen), Chris O'Dowd (Roy), and Richard Ayoade (Moss) are all extremely well executed; makes one want to find more of what they all have to offer. It is unfortunate that British comedies only have 6 episodes per series, I suppose it's quality over quantity. If you are hesitant on watching this show please don't be and please do so now. I am really not much of a TV critique (this being my first review) but this is one show I find to be extremely well thought out and deserving of the credit it needs. f you like comedy and have not seen this, the you are really missing something great."
tt0487831,"The IT Crowd is brilliant thanks to not only Graham Linehan's clever writing, (he also wrote the Irish classic Father Ted), but also because the actors have such a great chemistry. Absurd scenarios and quirky, over the top characters are the signatures of this show. Chris O'Dowd has become a Hollywood star, but Richard Ayoade, Katherine Parkinson and Matt Berry are equally talented. Having them all together in one show is really a treat. I'm so glad they came back for a final episode to give the series closure. If you are fond of British humor, or you work in IT support, you should definitely give this show a try. In my opinion, it is in the top ten, (or even the top five), shows of all time."
tt0487831,"The show's got a few episodes that bring side plots together for a 'grande finale'-esque bit, which is a very difficult style to pull off, especially for 22 minute episodes. The majority of the show is that awkward humor we geeks know and love so much. This show reminds me an awful lot of the cartoon series ""Clerks"" but with a more grown up feel. There are, as with any series, a few episodes that go so far over the top you groan from pain, but the chances of a deliciously laid out bit is well worth the endurance. Given the simple premise of the show, the script stays remarkably fresh. Brilliant acting on the part of the 3 primary leads and excellent writing make this an easy show to marathon over a weekend."
tt0487831,"Like Father Ted and Black Books before it this show is packed with great comedy. There are real gems in here (as well as some stuff we've seen before). Katherine Parkinson does a fine job as Jen, the voulnerable but strong IT manager (who doesn't do IT!),this is particularly satisfying as many Female characters don't fare well in comedy and can quickly fall into the 'say line to the camera, move off screen' rubbish we see so often. Chris O'Dowd is great as Roy and although he provides many of the 'stock comedy moments' this is mixed with new material and isn't detrimental to the overall piece. Richard Ayoade as Moss is another great character, to see how he peels an Orange is worth the DVD price alone. It is worth noting that this is already being traded on Ebay."
tt0487831,"Some episodes are really funny and geniusly written. It is worth watching this series, but some scenes are not really funny and forced laughter effect does not help at all."
tt0487831,"Graham Linehan wrote one of the very best comedies of the 1990s, ""Father Ted"". If you haven't seen it, you absolutely must. I was very fortunate to have my sister-in-law recommend ""The IT Crowd"" because it shows that Linehan is a very blessed writer...someone who has been brilliant twice or more in his career. I don't know how he did it, but ""The IT Crowd"" manages to be nearly as good as ""Father Ted"".The show is set in the basement of a building housing a mega-corporation*. It follows the adventures of two incredibly geeky computer nerds who provide support to folks who mostly couldn't care less about them. And, in the first episode they are joined by Jen...a rather dim career woman without a clue as to how computers or the internet actually work or how to fix anything! The show works well because of two big reasons. First, the dialog is brilliant...and often I could imagine Father Ted and the thickie Father Dougal having the exact same conversations. Second, the sitations the three characters get in are simply hilarious. I particularly loved the episode about the gay play as well as the episode where Jen decides to show everyone THE Internet! Overall, there's really nothing not to like about the show...watch it."
tt0487831,"I started watching The IT Crowd because of some strong advice from a friend, who loved the show very much and kept on saying how brilliant it is. I must say I'm completely disappointed with the show. First of all, the script is just plain awful. I mean, I like absurd stuff, I don't look for 'reality' in everything. But, this show is just out of bounds. The company seems to be run by completely insane people. You'd at least expect the IT guys to show some decent intelligence, right? They act like a bunch of idiots around ant yet, they keep saying the ""Have you tried turning it off and on again?"" line all the time. Secondly, the acting is very very poor, too. I think this show could be taught in acting schools as an example of overacting. I wanted to strangle the actors half the time I was watching as they think the only way of communication is yelling around in the room. Lastly, the laugh effects make the things even worse. So, if you haven't seen this show yet. Save your time and don't!"
tt0290988,"While I respect the opinions of those who criticized the show (not surprisingly the comments rated ""least useful""), it appears that their views are so concrete that they just don't get it.This brilliant series is not intended to reflect the ""reality"" of trailer park life in Nova Scotia, but is instead a wonderful artistic compilation of many extreme, bizarre, and mundane experiences that are interesting on an entertaining and (feigned) voyeuristic basis. There are operas, soap operas, space operas, and now ""park operas"". Consider how difficult it must be to act improv style not only on the set, but to act ""in character"" during all media interviews and public engagements, as is the expectation. Not many actors would have the commitment or stamina to carry this through for the benefit of the production image. Mike Smith, who plays the character Bubbles, apparently can only wear the thick glasses for 15 minutes at a time without extreme fatigue.Let's consider the acting quality and skill. Would Deniro or Pacino make this a better series? No! The charm is in the rough edges, the improv, the humility, and the belief that these are low rung thugs. It is totally believable and a credit to the acting and direction.How is Canada or Nova Scotia being insulted if we recognize that this series is a parody and that we should not take it so seriously. According to the on-line polls I have viewed for TPB of the episodes to date, the average rating has been 9 out of 10. Most of those voting were from Canada followed by participants from the US, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. We should be proud that we have had an impact on others, especially on those outside of our country. If given a chance, you will see how the brilliance shines through the layers of carefully placed sh#@. It is meant to look amateurish!"
tt0290988,Makes me laugh out loud every episode. Every day I think about the episode he climbs out of the car flip with a full drink
tt0290988,"I've been an avid fan of the show for about a decade now. There's an odd charm, a bit of an attraction to the simplicity of the way of life that the characters in the show live, that is oddly alluring. Talk about a fictional, worry-free escape in the world of television, this is the epitome of such a deviation from the real world.The show follows three main characters: Ricky, who is the completely emotionally-fueled, irrational one of the lot, who constantly puts himself AND OTHERS into horrible and illegal situations, only to shrug it off as ""no big deal"" (one of the show's many running jokes), and tries to pass the blame onto someone else. And then there's Julian, who is often seen as the ""brains"" of the trailer park, but really he's mostly in it for himself, and while his heart in usually in the right place, and it's known he cares about his friends, he often forgets the latter and makes decisions only to benefit himself. He also is never seen without a rum & coke in his hand. And finally, there's Bubbles. A special lad, with an adorable affection for kitties, he's usually the voice of reason between the three, even though he may come off as more ""special"" than his friends. He's the more sympathetic of the trio, and an avid Rush fan. Sometimes, due to the crazy antics of his friends and the lovable psychos of the trailer park, he's often put into unfortunate situations.And one HAS to give love to the man who plays Jim Lahey, who is the drunk and vengeful supervisor of the trailer park, always looking to get even with ""the boys."" And a special nod goes to J-Roc, one of TV's most hilariously pathetic characters, whose quotes will live on forever,""'naw what I'm sayyin' booiii?"" Seriously, every scene with this character is absolute gold.The show is absolutely hilarious. The characters are so ridiculous, their ways of life and their mannerisms are so preposterous you can't help but love them. If you can get past all the crude language, that is. And of that, there is a LOT. But the whole show is riddled with brilliant comedy, memorable quotes, and a charming flow.I absolutely LOVE this show. Especially the first half dozen seasons, before they were picked up by Netflix. I hate repeating myself, but there is such an uncanny CHARM to this show, it's completely irresistible."
tt0290988,"Like most people when I first saw this show I thought it was just another mindless low budget comedy series aimed at the dim-witted pot smokers among us. Then I watched it more and became mesmerized by the underlying brilliance, everything was not as it seemed, from the beautifully languid intro music, to the ingenious documentary style of filming. Much like SCTV, it uses the low budget quality of the show, and turns that into a bonus. THe shaky hand-held camera, the occasional boom mic shot all blend perfectly with the mostly improvised dialogue. There's something uniquely Canadian about this, making the best out of the fewest resources, and it demonstrates the greatness of the show that it does not need huge production values to make you laugh your ass off. And laugh you will as you watch the main characters, Ricky, Julian and Bubbles stumble their way through life. We have all met people like this, much like in the movie ""Fubar"", people who are completely ignorant and emotionally underdeveloped, yet very much content with their position in life. Both Fubar and TPB, the key is not to make fun of these people in a condescending way, look equally at their naive stupidity but also at their loyalty and innocence and genuineness.The 80's had SCTV, the 90's Kids in the Hall, for Canada, the 00's belong to the Trailer Park boys."
tt0290988,"Completely original, brilliantly written, beautifully acted, perpetually shocking and always quotable, TPB is simply one of the top 5 shows of all time. How many shows have had so, so many memorable, hilarious lines? Only the Simpsons, Larry Sanders, Sopranos quickly come to mind. The subject matter is refreshing and daring, it certainly could never escape heavy censorship in the US. Every line is funny, the dialogue is almost ""clockwork orange"" like. All the characters are excellent, the ensemble works so well together, I love seeing all of them, with their various looks changing season to season. Ricky may the best character overall, but they all have essential roles they have all mastered. I will admit that seasons 4 and 5 are slipping just the slightest bit from the dizzying heights of season 3, but it is still better than 99% of anything else. The Christmas Special ""Prequel"" from a couple of years ago was pure gold. It answered many questions, especially about Randy, and was brilliant. We finally got to see some winter scenes. Hopefully the movie will have some scenes in winter. The Alex Lifeson episode from season 3 should be in the TV Hall of Fame as one of the greatest 23 minutes ever shown. Thank you Canada!!! I am trying to spread the word down here in California."
tt0290988,"I advise every human being on earth to watch this show, idc how bad your day has been or what's going on in your life this show will brighten your day and I promise you that you will Laugh and Smile while your watching the Amazing cast, John Dunsworth(Mr.Lahay) is hands down one of my personal favorite actors but this man is a Genius and plays a Drunk person Amazingly and he will be missed o so very much! Bottom Line this show will brighten your day I PROMISE!!!!"
tt0290988,This show is THE funniest damn show ever produced in Canada.  What a bunch of dumbasses these characters are!  You must see this show.  It is the funniest thing.  Just a bunch of small town folks living in a trailer park trying to make it.  Truly amazing!
tt0290988,Great comedy from Canada. The cast of characters is great and hilarious. Lots of funny moments and seasons. The show was funny but kind of tanked once Netflix brought it back. The movies are pretty good too.
tt0290988,"At first, it seems like the trailer park boys is a typical cult comedy you should watch if you want to watch something while high, but as the show keeps going you realize that this show is a masterpiece of classical comedy. Made to satirize the everyday life of the lowest of the classes and the problems that run with them, manages to make you laugh, tell the truth and promote human feelings in the most genuine way. Take a look at every character at the show and you realize just how funny everyday life really is. Jules, the responsible guy who never lets his glass of liquor off his hand, Bubbles, the benevolent little cat guy that everyone loves, and lives by fixing stolen carts and Ricky, the full-mouthed little a-hole friend that everyone has, never stops smoking even with nicotine patches on him.The show is full of many other interesting characters that have their own brand attitude that makes this show so funny and well made. The exaggeration is the main protagonist here, abuse, swearing, dope, gunfights all in a perfect mix of comedy exaggeration. The show wins you by making you love the characters and their exaggerating attitude the outlaw lifestyle and their constants attempts to make a living.If you love honest comedy, you are going to f-kin love this show. Thumbs up for Canada."
tt0290988,"This is my first review on this site.This is probably the funniest show I have ever seen.At first, I was a bit put off from it due to the way they film it. But once I grew on it by watching more episodes, it's actually a brilliant masterpiece.The characters are very interesting, in a ludicrous way. It's amazing how they continuously make such addictive story lines for such a small environment to work on.This is very cheaply made but with that in play, a lot of creativity put into such little to play with. That's what mostly makes it brilliant."
tt0290988,"My favourite thing about trailer park boys has to be the characters, they are CRAZY, from ricky trying to get his 4th grade to Lahey trying to get the boys thrown in jail. There is nothing else like it on TV .Its so surreal and absurd at some points you cant help but wet yourself with laughter. every season is as good as the last including season 6, even though most people say it sucks, COME ON PEOPLE, THE FILM IS OUT IN THE SUMMER! I just hope they keep making this show whether the movie is a success or not.LONG LIVE TRAILER PARK BOYS!"
tt0290988,"As my title says, the original 7 seasons that aired on Showcase in Canada from 2001 to 2007 were great. Yes, I even loved season 7, which it seems most other fans of the show don't really like this season, but I do and honestly, compared to the Netflix seasons, you'll appreciate season 7 a lot more. Also, the original TPB The Movie released in 2006 and was pretty good. The show seemed to have ended with season 7 in '07, but of course, fans wanted more of the boys and due to popular demand, a TV movie was released titled Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys, which was pretty great in my opinion. Then another movie titled Countdown to Liquor Day was released the following year in 2009, which was, just Ok, in my opinion, of course. Finally, a 4th movie was released titled Don't Legalize It, which got mixed reviews but I really enjoyed it. Along with this came the announcement that Netflix was bringing the series back and that same year in September of 2014, Netflix released season 8 of Trailer Park Boys. And..., well, honestly, I didn't hate this season. I actually kind of liked it. Though, Mike Clattenburg's (the creator, head writer, and director of pretty much the entire show/movies up until this) absence from the show was very apparent. It was waaaay more over-the-top than it had ever been before, which was definitely a bad thing...ya know....in my opinion. But it wasn't terrible. However, we then come to season 9 released on Netflix on March 27th 2015 and...dear god, season 9 was just...it was so bad. It was so, so bad. I hated it so much. I found myself cringing so often and maybe let out a slight chuckle here and there. I know as shows go on, characters always tend to become caricatures of themselves, but this was ridiculous. In prior seasons, Ricky was at least capable of speaking at a normal volume sometimes. In this season, he pretty much screams every single word he says. The whole season is just bad. And season 10 is even worse. Not much to say other than it's just god-awful. It feels like it's trying so so hard to be over-the-top and give shock-humor but it's just bad in every way. Seasons 11 and 12 were definitely a huge step up from the previous 2 before it but still nothing great. Seasons 1-7 were peak TPB for me and I'm sure most fans of the show would probably agree."
tt0290988,"Season One: 3/10Themes: Trailer Park, Comedy, Ex-Cons, Drugs, Petty Crime, Friendship, Stupidity & Canadian.Review: I really do not understand the appeal of this show. It's about a bunch of complete idiots, doing nothing but scream at each other, swear like there's no tomorrow, fire off guns as if it's their new favourite toy, and be drunk all the damn time. It just wasn't funny and I didn't laugh even once. The characters were extremely annoying to the point of me rolling my eyes at them every episode. The plot itself is also super uninteresting; it's the same thing over and over again, and besides being repetitive, it was very boring in and of itself. I'm definitely not a fan. Perhaps I'm missing something here, but I just don't see what would be entertaining about this series. It was just silly and ridiculous."
tt0290988,"When I first left a review of this show I was fairly unimpressed with it. However, since then I've forced myself to watched the entire Seasons 1-3 and I have to say it: man, was I wrong.It grows on you. If you can get over the bad acting and the political incorrectness you'll find one hell of a show. As another reviewer said it's not an accurate reflection of life in a Nova Scotia trailer park: more like if you took the weirdest members of every trailer park in NS and put them together to dumb it up.Some of the funnier aspects I've found have been Ricky's constant mispronunciations (there are at least then in every episode), Mr Lahey's constant sh*t analogies, and, of course, Bubbles, who makes even the bad episodes worth watching.If you give it a chance you won't have a single favourite episode; more like a collection of favorite moments pulled from each ep. Whether it's J-Roc's identity crisis (""I hate to admit it ... I'm white""), Bubbles' dragging a drunken Ricky home in the back of his go-cart, or the visit from the hysterically creepy Bible Pimp, there'll be at least something that makes you giggle whenever you think of it.All that said, BBC America can look forward to a few letters of mixed reactions, and Comedy Central can start kicking themselves for not being the first to snatch it up."
tt0290988,"I got the first two seasons on DVD as a gift just recently...I had sadly never heard of the show before that. That being said, I sat down and started watching and I ended up watching the first two seasons right in a row practically without stopping....that's how good it is. A lot of the comedy is subtle, background stuff that continues to surface even after multiple viewings. This show is definitely geared towards people with a slightly twisted sense of humor that don't require a laugh track or a punch line to clue them into the humor. All hilarity aside, this crew does a good job in getting you to believe in the characters and to generally want to know what happens with them -- even when you know most of what they WILL do will make you cringe one way or another. Now I have to see about getting other seasons on DVD..."
tt0290988,"Watched the first episode and wasn't really impressed. My son-in-law talked me into giving the show another try. Some of the best comedy, EVER, from any country. Went to see the stage show with Tremblay,Wells and Smith in Dearborn in 2012. True to form these guys were just hilarious. Smith is also a good singer and accomplished guitarist.Many ""back"" stories about these characters, ""Bubbles"" actually showed up on the set to apply for a sound mixing job and someone asked him to try on the goofy glasses........a star was born, so to speak.""Ricky's"" dad ""Ray"" is actually one of the executive producers and Sarah in real life is Jim Lahey's daughter."
tt0290988,"I never heard of these guys or the show. I seen this and had to get it. I like stupid and sick humor.The characters are all real if you think about it, or ever been or knew someone in a trailer park. As funny as that may seem.You got your pot head, your thief, you nut case yet kind of nice guy, your trailer park whore, you pretty much got it all.I have to say after never hearing of them and after seeing this movie i am watching all there TV shows now. They are awesome.They are almost so good at what they do, you would think its a reality show and there not acting!!!"
tt0290988,"The definition of Canadian comedy with a strong sense of a reality mockumentary. At first you may laugh at the show's odd characters, semi skilled acting, and the amount of swearing and outrages endings. The main group is Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles, all putting their own twist on the trio. Set in a trailer park the group simply solves their financial problems through robberies, cultivation, guns and scams everyone more extreme then the next. The group has there highs and their very lows, living in the shitmobile and constantly fighting the trailer park supervisor. I love this show and cant get enough of it, everyone should give it a try and watch the emotional roller-coaster of The Trailer Park BOys."
tt0290988,"And I watch WAYYY TOO MUCH TV AND MOVIES. This show is one of the funniest shows I've seen so far. The characters are great, I especially love Ricky-obviously. The fact that there is a character who refuses to wear shirts should make you want to watch this on it's own.I read a comment that said it's isn't like real trailer park life in Nova Scotia, and maybe not. But it's a pretty damn accurate portrayal of life in a U.S. trailer park in the south. I mean, I've seen these people at Wal-Mart...all of them. There's a Jim Lehey everywhere, you just have to look hard enough.Don't forget to watch The Mighty Boosh!"
tt0290988,"Now, for a comment from a yank. This is THE funniest, THE biggest-hearted show I've ever had the good fortune to stumble across! On behalf of all of us poor, misbegotten souls that live due south of you Canadian's lower border (a.k.a the tree line) (sorry, I just couldn't resist), thank you, thank you, thank you! TPB isn't distributed in the U.S. as far as I can tell, so if you're a yank and unless you happen to live near the border and can watch CBC you won't know about this show other than by freak accident (it was a Netflix experiment for me). I see from the last couple of pages that there really are a few trifling slobs (on both sides of the Canadian/U.S. DMZ) that just don't get it. Well , I'm truly sorry for those poor miserable souls, probably something to do with the amount of fiber in their diet, but down here in Alabama WE sure get it! I've made it a (minor) mission to spread TPB around to everyone I can find with a pulse and I have yet to find anyone who (after a few episodes) hasn't been won over heart and soul (I make my friends send off for the DVD's after the first I give them, kind of like the neighborhood pusher). I won't say they don't exist in 'Bama (a land that may not have invented trailer parks, but has certainly perfected them) just that they're rare. Maybe that's why I like this part of the planet so much. I'm sorry for those who just don't get it, but I'm hard pressed to understand them either. After all, anyone who has ever had a family should recognize Ricky, Julian, Bubbles, et. al., with all their schemes, their plots, all their massively dysfunctional and f***ed up ways (to quote Ricky), and all their grace and generosity (where it REALLY matters) immediately. I know I certainly do, those guys are everyone I'm related to and everyone I ever grew up with boiled down and condensed. Apparently a lot of others do as well, which says many good things about the human race (even that part of it living in the desert south of you Canadian's border). This is a magnificent show, it makes me laugh so hard I have to pace myself so I won't end up at the doctor's office. I'm waiting on pins and needles for the movie (which should be out this month according to the net) and for the next season, and I really do mean pins and needles, what in the world will Ricky do next?! If you've somehow managed to read this far along in the comments and haven't seen TPB, do yourself a favor and get it! If you still don't like it eat a bran muffin or something, you're obviously in need it."
tt0290988,"When most people sit down with Trailer Park Boys Season One, they are going to be confused. It's crude, amoral, and not traditionally funny. It's also a direct continuation of a lesser known movie, which is an even bigger entry barrier to enjoying what turns out to be one of the best comedy series ever made.Comedy is arguably the most subjective genre in film, and it would not surprise me if many people can't hurdle the walls that this show puts in place.I have trouble recommending it to a general audience.However, the brilliance of TPB isn't overt. It's in the subtext, verisimilitude, heart, and attention to detail. Similar to Idiocracy, the dumb-slapstick humor often provides a thick veil that the viewer must push aside to reveal the real comedic backbone of the content.Most of the funniest stuff in this show isn't said, but rather shown or implied.The sets and the props, for instance, are incredibly detailed and destitute. There are bits of hilarity strewn through the backdrops of almost every scene that a discerning viewer will notice and get a chuckle from. TPB, particularly in seasons 1-7, is relentless in portraying poverty, criminality, and desperation. This perspective is never broken in the early seasons, and its painfully accurate in many of its non-judgmental representations of people in the lowest rungs of society who are just trying to get-by.The cast of eclectic characters equally shines here. Everyone in the park has a very distinct personality and reason for existing within the park's ecosystem. Even in the later seasons, when they ramp the silliness up while leaning into caricatures, it's still a joy to watch. There's a certain comfort that the viewer gets with this cast, as if we are also living in the park with them.And, that's probably the show's greatest success - being a window into the lives of flawed people living in a tough situation, but who are still trying to make the best out of it. There's simply no other show quite like it.When Netflix (known in the show as SwearNet) took over the show for seasons 8-12, it was eight years after the original series finale aired. Someone, perhaps Mike Smith (Bubbles) who became a primary writer, decided to change some of the portrayals in the show to be extremely over-the-top. Many fans of the original series despise these changes, and refuse to even watch the last five seasons.However, once one gets used to the cartoony switch of tone, there is plenty of amusement and laugh-out-loud moments to still be had. Though it does feel like Netflix ripped some of the tone and heart from Clattenburg's classic, the show still ends up feeling a cut above other comedies, mostly due to the great character-acting and ridiculous plotlines.Even though I gave TPB a perfect 10 rating, the show isn't perfect by any means. In my countless viewings, I've noticed some continuity errors and jarring pacing. The five Netflix seasons, specifically, are tonally disconnected from the original series in many ways.However, the re-watchability of TPB is unlike any show I've ever seen. Many, many shows were influenced by this early mockumentary, and it's obvious why. This is a great binge and an even greater background-show. It's consistently funny and realistic, while still being silly and bombastic.Nothing is perfect, but for what this show is, nothing could be perfecter.10/10 Must-Watch."
tt0290988,"When I first discovered TPB, I really felt I discovered a new type of cult following. You know that moment when you saw Peep Show or The Thick of It for the first time? It felt like that. Fresh, laugh out loud comedy.It's also great how the boys manage to get you on their side even though you know most of what they're doing is downright criminal.
The sociology of this program is great as it paints a picture of very petty Trailor Park criminals who are also just people trying find their way in the world and establish peace in the park - despite some crazy antics, they really are good people who you root for.I found it got progressively funny throughout seasons. At first, I turned off S8/E1 because it seemed a little polished and scripted but I went back to it after years and found it really did grip me much more than the previous series - the polishing was absolutely spot on. The stories got deeper and the new characters actually grew on me.
What a great show."
tt0290988,"This show will be a cult favorite, like another Canadian classic SCTV.  One day it will be showing on US cable and watch out this show will explode. Like the hosers on SCTV, this show pokes fun at Canadians in a backwards way.  Nice to see people laugh at themselves.  What makes this show funny, is some of these characters must result from real life experiences. Everyone either has a relative, friend, co-worker, like Ricky, Bubbles, Corry, Trevor, and J Rock.  J Rock the 29 year old, ridiculous looking White rapper wannabe, who lives with his mom.  Ricky, the trailer park idiot,(Will Farrel of the show) who provides 90% of the material, while living in a car missing a right door; and Corry with his pal Trevor the 2 slow witted wannnabes who end up holding the bag.  Living in East Kildonan this reminds me of my youth and shows how believable casting, and writing overcomes a lower budget.  What's next a show about Postal Workers."
tt0290988,"I just don't understand why so many people in Canada actually believe this is so hilarious. I grant you, some times there is a line or two that hit the funny bone and the premise is decent (though much of it is recycled episode after episode), but the vast vast majority of bit intended to be funny just are not. I mean, one time with the ""shit__"" (shitthis, shitthat, shitstorm, shittornado, shitwhatever) is funny because it shows something about the Leahy character, but every frikking episode?! And after the first season or two, everybody seems to concatenate ""shit"" to everything, not just Leahy. It's like they got a laugh out of it once so they repeat it ad nauseum. And the drink constantly in hand, OK, that works for a while and would work better if there were periods where there is no drink, but it is no longer funny and is entirely forced after a few seasons of it. And the Bubbles character...I'm sorry, I love laughing at the disabled as much as any red-blooded able-bodied person, but come on. There is not a line out of his mouth that is funny on its own, everything is un-funny/dumb and is forced through his dull imitation of an idiot savant voice. It's about like watching the character that Jerry Lewis played with Dean Martin updated with ""sh*t"" and ""f*ck"". And they devote whole shows to the one unfunny bit that they seem to think is hilarious. Case in point, ""Conky"".I believe they conceived the whole program based entirely around the guy who plays Ricky being very adept at malapropisms and having the eastern Canadian redneck schtick down very well. The other characters, every one of them, were afterthoughts, straight men/women for him to play off. In fact, much of the dialogue comes off as ad lib by people who are nervous doing it and are not very clever or quick, as though they were told a situation and had to wing it from there, playing a sort of mad-lib with the other actors. Like the director said, ""Ok, everyone, Conky is a ventriloquists doll that Bubbles really likes. Play with that. And....action!"" Besides the occasional Ricky-based funny bits, I think the best part of the show is the entry and exit music; it is somehow to me soothing, lightly happy and nostalgic, like it deserves to have a bubble machine in the background. I honestly think that is why I have watched so many of the episodes because, honestly, if you've seen one you have seen them all, or at least seen all the jokes."
tt1094229,"First off, I'm a 32 year old man living in Upstate New York. I drive a truck and have seen a horse up close maybe 3 times. I love this show. The acting is great and the script is written very well. Every now and then, you can predict something, but very rarely can you be specific. Everyone talks about the horses and the heartwarming tales. I agree with all of that. I'm writing this as of the completion of the 8th season. Ty's character was my favorite. I loved Amy as well, but Ty is the kid with the troubled past. I enjoyed how his past became relevant more than once. It's not like he moved and everyone back home forgot about him. He grew as a person and a man. Great things were portrayed in this show.Also the message Heartland and nature portrays. There is more to live than city living. There's more out there. And it's a richer life.I strongly recommend this show."
tt1094229,"Living where I am in Buffalo, New York I'm fortunate to get a few Canadian television shows from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation which is on my cable package. If I didn't I wouldn't be seeing Heartland which I'm informed is Canada's longest running television series.Family patriarch is Shaun Johnston who is a man of the land and in his way of living land means you grow things and or you feed animals off the things you grow. He's a cowboy and still a working one at that. But he's smart enough to bend with the times and part of his land is now a dude ranch for dudes who want to pretend. Not thrilled with the idea, but it's an income and the family works at it as a family enterprise.My favorite of the characters is Chris Potter who is best known for the role of Peter Caine in Kung Fu - The Legend Continues. He's Johnston's errant son-in-law, a former rodeo star who can't forget the roar of the crowd and hasn't quite matured. As this series is almost a decade old Potter and the rest have really honed their characters pretty good.Heartland is a really nice product from Canada and we Americans who can see it should be grateful."
tt1094229,"I confess this show is one of my clearly-no-longer secret pleasures. The stories of Heartland resonate with me in quite a different way then most of the pablum I watch on television. The travails of a multi-generational country family, the mix of urban experience and back to the horse-manure land operation, the western motif and the youthful tales of love, of coming of age, of environmental concern, well I find some comfort and a strong sense of just about lost values in the telling. Above all else, the story of the young horse whisperer is almost mystical. If it borders on trite from time to time, it is easy to forgive this creative slight. A very pleasant TV experience."
tt1094229,"Love watching the show. My daughter and grand daughter love it too. Grand daughter is 2 and says horsey show mama. She would have it on all the time. Too cute. Wish we had more heart warming shows like this. I like the values it teaches. Family is so very important, and this shows a family's struggles and victories. Sleepless nights I turn on Heartland and have a marathon till morning. Wishing episodes 6-8 were available here. I will just have to wait. The story line and cast are excellent. Awesome family show. Makes me want to get baby girl a pony. Would love to see Calgary someday. It truly is beautiful. Would recommend watching this series, it will fill your heart with joy. Grew up with horses at grandfathers. So the story falls right in with all I remember growing up."
tt1094229,"Heartland is a true family show grounded in the values of times past but in a present context, leaving the viewer with a light and happy feeling at the end of each episode. It is a true delight to watch and the characters are incredibly genuine, making it easy to empathise with their lives and dilemmas. My son is 15 years old and as with other children his age, addicted to modern technology, yet since I discovered Heartland, we enjoy nothing more than sitting down in the evening and watching a few episodes as a family, something that I doubt no other PG-rated show could have achieved. I would recommend Heartland to everyone of all ages who wants to watch a heartwarming television show that brings its stories to life."
tt1094229,"I love Heartland as a feel-good show to watch. I love the horses and the scenery and most of the characters, particularly Jack. But I want to smack Lou and her dad, Tim. Both are selfish and don't really think about anyone but themselves. I guess that's just part of the show but Tim especially has no real redeeming characteristics and should just be ran off the ranch!"
tt1094229,"I have watched every episode more than once. It's the one show that leaves one with a sense of family and community with both people and animals. It's a slice of heaven. My girls love working with horses. The peaceful outdoors and focus on prioritizing family/finding healthy balance is SO necessary, especially in this day and age. I know there is an immense amount of work and dedication that goes into creating each scene, episode, and season. I know the actors have been at this for years, over a decade. We are growing up with these characters. They take us to our happy place that leaves us grateful and hopeful. As much as I know that it is difficult, I am massively grateful that it continues. I pray it can be like the soap operas that never end...this kind of show has the goodness the SHOULDN'T end and the appeal/principles that NEVER GET OLD. I support this show with every thing in me. Thank you for continuing to put goodness into the world. Please, PLEASE, PLEEEASE don't stop. We are extraordinarily appreciative of the new seasons being available online in the US. THANK YOU! Please keep in mind the big picture and continue providing such awesome family content. We love you and are true and forever fans of the magic of HEARTLAND 💖🐎"
tt1094229,"I read the books when I was little and never knew they had been made into a TV series until this year so I had some major catching up to do! I can't really remember too much of the books just the basic bits which is probably a good thing. I found this show totally addictive. The characters were brilliant, there was not a single one I didn't like, which adds to its watchability. Jack what a man; so well acted and such a great character. I would say my one problem with the series so far is that they have not used Caleb as well as they could of. Especially in the last few series where he was pretty much forgotten about. I am a horse person but I could quite easily watch the series without the horses, they are an added bonus. The plots, although at times very predictable, are incredibly heart warming and I challenge you to watch some episodes without crying. My only niggles (apart from the Caleb thing) would be just general stuff you know from having horses... your finger nails never stay lovely and manicured for more than 5 minutes and if you manage to stay clean you obviously haven't done things properly!Other than that its a brilliant show and I look forward to the next series!"
tt1094229,"Great story-telling in this series and every aspect is well produced: acting, writing, and the incredible scenery. I'm about halfway through the 12-season show, and am simply enjoying the heck out of it. The horses are great actors, too, and should win awards. It does seem everyone is doing most of their own riding, they make it all so very realistic. The lead Amy played by Amber is incredible, who knew one person could do so many different types of riding and do it well? Horse dancing, to dressage, to jumping, to rodeo, to racing, to communicating deeply with horses in a genuine heart-felt way gets conveyed incredibly well. There's lots of topics that reveal ranch life in today's world that is interesting as well. From wild horses to oil, class war, business vs. family life, addiction, native people's oppression and resilience, death and loss, relationship dysfunction, craziness and creative solutions (no sex). Then there's the whole healing aspect that comes from living in and/or visiting the land where the heart rules. The therapeutic work with the horses affects the people and vice versa in sometimes amazingly touching and profoundly metaphorical ways. The show goes deep and is lighthearted too. It cannot be an easy show for the actors to do because it is quite physically demanding. There's violence, though not too bad, fires, explosions, shooting, avalanches, rescues, fights, lots of action. The characters, including repeating characters and are so well-drawn and acted, you end up taking them to heart. There are a few places where what they do doesn't quite fit with them, what they know or would do in just a few situations, but otherwise the character arcs, their growth and development over the years is an incredible journey of the heart. Totally enjoyable for the whole family, too. If you don't love horses when you start this series, you will."
tt1094229,"Heartland is a heartwarming, and exciting family series. My daughters and I love the show - it has become a real mother - daughters time for us. We love horses and the ""Healing Horses / Healing Hearts"" theme is really inviting and enduring to us. We have a large number of friends and family that share our feelings and interest in the show - which makes watching it even more exciting because my daughters love going to school the next day to talk with all of their friends about what happened on the last episode. We just finished watching the season finale and my daughters begged me to go online to find out if the first season will be coming out on DVD and when the second season will possibly start. We find the show very well acted, and extremely well written - the story line is infuriatingly enticing (we can hardly wait to see what will happen to the characters next). The fact that it is based in the Canadian Rockies is just a bonus and certainly must make filming the beautiful landscapes easier. The camera angles and lighting certainly create the right mood for the moment and really make the characters and setting believable. It is hard to believe that a story based on such a tragedy can bring such feelings of love and happiness to the surface, but this show really pulls it off. There is just the right combination of action, drama, romance and comedy to make it enjoyable for everyone watching. We look forward to the next season (we are saddened that the first season is over already). We surely hope that the first season will be brought out on DVD very soon as it is the type of show that one can watch over and over again."
tt1094229,"The main story with Amy and Ty is pretty good, but some of the supporting characters are unwatchable. I have to fast forward through any scenes with Mallory, Lou and Georgie. Either they are a control freak or a bratty kid or both. Georgie is the worst. If she isn't putting someone else in danger with her antics, she is maiming herself or destroying someone's property. She is a constant drama queen, sobbing and saying ""I'm sorry"". Its so unrealistic that she would not suffer any consequences for her sometimes dangerous behavior in a ranch setting."
tt1094229,"Sorry, that headline might make you think I hate the show, but actually I'm loving it, for all the same reasons others have mentioned. Heartwarming, wonderful acting, good stories. But honestly, Lou and Tim and just plain insufferable. They're both self-centered, passive-aggressive, and frequently bullies.That said, the real reason I watch the show is the horses. I can't get enough of those beautiful horses. And the horsemanship. At first I thought there was some camera trickery going on or a stunt double for sure. So I looked up Amber Marshall's (Amy) bio and learned she's a bona fide equestrian. I love watching her ride."
tt1094229,"We are currently in season 3. We are enjoying the show but good heavens, I've never seen so many self-centered inconsiderate people in my life. How these people stay in any relationship is beyond me. Amy gets upset about the dumbest things. It can get SO frustrating watching it at times. I want to slap some of them on a regular basis."
tt1094229,"Because I love horses and beautiful mountain scenery, I have enjoyed the show. The writing is good just looking at the arc of the story, but I have a bit of a problem with the dialog between characters. They are rude to one another. All of them are with the exception of maybe Jack, Amy, and Ty. In addition, no child in the show is made to suffer the logical consequences of their behavior. This is especially true for Tim's and Georgie's character. Georgie will blatantly not do what she was asked and when a consequence is given to her, the adults rarely follow through. As a matter of fact she gets her way because she acted out. No child in real life would grow into the well rounded adult we see her moving towards. They would have simply been taught that I can do what I want when I want and still get to trick ride! I find it so unrealistic! Also, Tim is really rude, but everyone just puts up with what he does and says and so his behavior is tolerated as though it is normal. And it may be, with some people in real life, but someone who acts like he does would have few friends and be barely tolerated by family. It isn't normal in my world. If I talked to people at school where I work the way Tim Fleming talks to people, I would not hold a job for long. And Lou is so neurotic it is horrible. The world must revolve around her. So what if Jack and Lisa were married in a way that they wished to. Nothing wrong with that in my book. But to Lou, everything and everyone must meet her expectations or you are wrong! So, I don't think the give and take between characters is realistic. And worse than that, I think this show teaches kids that nothing is wrong with being rude, petty, and selfish. You get what you want anyway! Not a way to raise responsible people.
Thank goodness for the horses and scenery!!!"
tt1094229,"I discovered this series by accident on UP TV. The saga revolves around the multi-generational Fleming family on their Heartland ranch in Alberta. Grandfather Jack is a somewhat crusty individual who is the one everyone else turns to for advice and help in times of trouble. Amy is the central character, one of Jack's two granddaughters, who is, if you will excuse the expression, a horse whisperer. Lou is the other granddaughter, a good-hearted but often too aggressive take-charge person. Chris Potter plays Amy's and Lou's father, an x-rodeo cowboy always looking for a make-money scheme. His wife was killed in an accident, which plays heavily in the first seasons episodes. Ty Borden comes to Heartland on a temporary visit and stays on as his character grows in importance. These cast members, and all the other permanent or temporary cast members are fine actors. The scripts are well written and directed. Once you see a few episodes you will be hooked and look forward to the next and the next."
tt1094229,"We have watched this series from the beginning and bought all the dvds available to date . I am a former horse(many horses) owner and can relate to many of the situations seen on the series, Amber Marshall has grown up on the show and has a real compassion for horses onset and in her private life, so what you seen on screen is for the most part real feelings and emotions. All the actors on this show have great chemistry and a lot of fun to watch interact. if you live in the USA and want to watch current episodes of this show you can subscribe to UpTV and stream it. If you love horses or just a good down to earth family show to relax and watch you should give this a try, I do not think you will be disappointed. Have Fun"
tt1094229,"I just love watching heartland, i normally hate things like this but heartland leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy afterwards. The characters are lovable and the horses are amazing. The story's are gripping and leave you desperate for more. I have watched every single episode as far as series 5. I cant wait for series 6 and hope they go on to make a series 7, 8, 9 and 10. I like that it surrounds the natural horsemanship methods and has a few good tips in there as well. I have seen so much i would love to learn with my horse since watching this, it makes me wanna up sticks and move to Canada!! The scenery is amazing, and it is nice watching all the different seasons and all the trials and tribulations that happen with new weather. I like it when it snows at heartland. My fave characters are of course Amy. She plays her role brilliantly. Its really nice watching amy grow in confidence until she truly becomes a true horsewoman. My next fave would have to be jack, Amy grandfather. He plays a grumpy yet lovable character full of wisdom and kindness. He has a strong sense of family values and try's his best to keep everyone happy. There are lots of laughs surrounding jack and he is never far from a drama. The show just would not be the same without him. All the other characters are great too, and it is nice they constantly add new people to the show, they keep the series fresh and moving forward. I watch this with both my daughters who are 9 and 4 and they love watching it. When the music starts they are running to the sofa as quickly as they can, and they don't move till its over. We have all 5 seasons on DVD and they watch them over and over again. What i will be watching after this finishes i do not know! I have tried watching other horsey TV series but they just don't have the same appeal. This is the type of programme that is best watched with a hot chocolate, some munch and a nice blanket at night with the warm glow of the fire. It makes the evening cozy. There is nothing better than cuddling up with the kids to watch heartlandI hope they make more. I just love this programme."
tt1094229,"Hollywood has gone so high-tech and their salaries are so exorbitant that they cannot make shows like this. The United States has beautiful scenery just like Canada, in fact here in Tennessee on the Cumberland plateau we have vistas very similar except the mountain peaks are not as sharp. If I ever won the lottery I would love to produce a show like this in Tennessee in a rural area or even maybe Kentucky. The film crews would not have to worry with as much snow so that part would be a little bit easier. Amber Marshall is one of those magical finds for a leading role. Amber plays Amy exceedingly well because she is in real life a horse owner, rider, trainer and animal lover in real life. Anyone that does not like this show would not like me, because I grew up around horses long ago. Now the area where I am at has few stables and my parents are gone and I am disabled so this brings back many fond memories. Kind of sad when I look back I keep hoping my health would improve and allow me to go and purchase another horse for my farm, I may not be able to ride it but I could still train it to pull a cart and do tricks.Another thing the ASPCA in the United States has got out of control as to where they have ruined many of horse farms. They have created such a glut that horse desertion in Tennessee was at an all-time high 10 years ago."
tt1094229,"I like the show but I'm only in season 4 and I have to wonder if the writers know how annoying Lou, Tim, and Amy are. I can't stand Lou. She is a whiny selfish brat who only thinks of herself. There's not one single episode where I don't want to smack her. Tim is quite the selfish swindling jerk himself. Like father, like daughter. And Amy is slightly better, but her holier than thou attitude is hard to swallow sometimes. Just had to get that off my chest."
tt1094229,"I am late to the party on this show (I'm in season 5) and it's been really enjoyable. My only complaint is with Mallory and Lou. Mallory is way too annoying, and makes me want to hit ""mute"" when she's on. Lou often comes across as a diva. I know it seems like a negative review, but I love the other characters, the photography, scenery and of course, the horses. Will stick with it."
tt0182629,"I must say that this is THE BEST ANIME I have EVER seen!!! It definitely is the perfect mix of romance, story, history, mystery, and all other good things all rolled into one series! I especially love it because of its strong storyline and characters. Every character has a history and this anime has been created in a way that allows them to show you that background on each character, making each character all the more interesting. I also like the subtle romance it portrays and the way that it intertwines real Japanese history with fiction - that was probably the best part, actually.Anyway, from the first episode, I was hooked...I was so hooked, I finished the series within like a month and half. Now, I'm on to reading the manga, which is just as good as the anime. This is one anime that I can watch over and over and not get bored of!"
tt0182629,"This is one of the greatest anime series I have ever seen. I have been introduced anime on relatively recently...1997 at earliest. In that time, I've gotten my hands on a number of really good and really bad shows. Kenshin is definitely among the best.The dynamic emotions of Kenshin himself as well as the mix of humor and philosophy of life vs. death in the show make it exceptionally entertaining and captivating.The mutual devotion between Kenshin and his friends, Kaoru, Sanoske, Yahiko, etc... is amazing to watch as it develops and is put to the test.The sadistic enemies, and the foolish ones, all provide foils that drive the plot and cause the viewer to be moved as Kenshin struggles to throw off his murderous past in favor of a life defending his honor, his friends, and the innocent.If you are a long time anime-buff, or a new fan of the genre...this series is a must-see."
tt0182629,"Without any doubt this is one of the best animated series ever done and my favored of all times.The way they combine fiction and real facts of Japanese history occurred during the Mei Ji era make it more interesting.What make it different from other Japanese series is that in this case the main character, Kenshin Himura, has a real purpose to fight for in order to mend all those terrible things he did in the past. Another point about it is the way they combine drama, action, romance and comedy. The backgrounds and the music are just brilliant and exquisite. There's no doubt these series has one of the best soundtracks."
tt0182629,"This is a truly fantastic series... dramatic characters, a hero that is capable of huge mood swings (from goofy, to romantic, to blood thirsty), and female characters that you would swear your life to protect or swear..well... I must be civil.Great sword-fighting actions scenes, a drop of history (it takes place in the 1870s), and some philosophizing about living a life of violence versus peace make this series cover the gamut of emotions a viewer wants from any series, not just anime.I hope everyone can take notice of this story, it is not for everyone, but it hits so many points relevant to our current world order: from terrorism (bad guys attacking the fragile government), to being able to look at the world as something other than a battlefield (Kenshin vowing not to kill after so many years as an assassin)."
tt0182629,"The anime is about a wandering samurai in the 11th year of the Meiji era (around 1878)who stumbles upon a dojo in Tokyo and decides to stay there, helping in and around it. He protects the weak against the strong with his sword (even when they are banned) and in the process, runs into some friends and enemies from the past. The series also has some characters who really existed in the history of Japan which makes it all the more interesting. The best episodes to watch are 28 through 62, but you will need to go through the earlier ones which are sometimes silly to really understand them. The soundtrack alone is exceptional and is worth listening to. In my opinion it is better than most animes in its class."
tt0182629,Rurouni Kenshin is an epic anime series about a wandering swordsman named Kenshin Himura who protects people with his reversed-blade sword. Rurouni Kenshin has everything you could possibly want in an anime series. It is available on DVD and VHS.
tt0182629,"You cannot call yourself a sci-fi fan without watching Star Trek or Farscape. And you certainly cannot call yourself a true anime fan without watching Rurouni Kenshin. Few years ago I didn't even know the word anime, but since I accidentally saw RK I became an addict. It is full of action, fun, romance, BATTLES and most of all many COOL characters. I still can't call anyone a favourite even years after. Most of all I enjoyed the fact that the main characters are not divided into good and bad. There's just sides, which is more like in real life. If you like sword fight, samurai or just the best animes this one is a MUST-TO-SEE."
tt0182629,"Need I say that after watching Samurai X Trust and Betrayal I was compelled to buy the series. It's completely the opposite of Trust and Betrayal and when it tries to get serious it's only ever cliché and generic. There's nothing I hate more than extensive talking during what's supposed to be a fight scene! (or an epic battle) And that's the formula for almost every single fight scene.Antagonist: Check out my technique. It's invincible, I'll destroy you etc..People on the sideline: He's using the (insert technique name) that can only be countered by (random crap) Oh noes, Kenshin will be slaughtered.Protagonist: I can't kill people. But I'll defeat you, despite your invincible technique/my injuries etc...(Insert more conversation, with a dash of action to break up the fighting conversation) Yes, it truly is a pitiful formula. The most obvious form of fillers.Pacifism is OK, but doesn't seem to work well for 95 episodes. As far as characters go. Kenshin and the police chap are quite solid characters. As for the others, there's no need for me to speak of them. They seem ""cartoony."" The type of character's you would expect in a show aimed at children? I liked at least 10% of the series nonetheless (I enjoyed the ""screwing around"" episodes more than the ""epic battle"" episodes to say the least). But the 90% I disliked was a waste of good money. As far as I understand it, the only reason this show could have as high a rating as it does is because of the sentimental bond that was formed with Kenshin's character in the previous renditions. I would definitely recommend Samurai Champloo over this if you want a good, solid samurai anime. In fact, I would recommend most other anime over this. Fullmetal Alchemsit, Mushishi, Trigun, Fruits Basket, Desert Punk, Licensed by Royalty, Gankutsuou, Cowboy Bebop to name a few. The list goes ever on and on.Share the Love, Azza"
tt0182629,"This is one of the most memorable and most recognizable anime I know, with a cast of great characters and story lines and funny sub-plots, it's everything you'd want to see in an anime. It starts out as Kenshin Himura a wanderer in the Meiji era, ends with a kendo teacher Kaoru Kamiya, and he starts living with her, and eventually she finds out this is no ordinary traveler, this is Battousai, the slasher! An infamous samurai who killed a lot of people in his past. But finds him to be a sweet gentle man who is kind towards children, who wants to restore peace, and end his days as a slasher. Later more characters appear, Yahiko, and then Sanosuke, then Megumi. A great cast with very dark and dramatic backgrounds filled with tragedies. Every episode seems to give each character some background and info and their dark secrets. The soundtracks are also great, I love the one by L~Arc~Ciel in the latter episodes. The sword fighting is also cool, and unforgettable. But wait, a few characters portrayed or based on actual people, like Saitou Hajime and Aritomo Yamagata, oh my, I wonder if they were really like that in real life, I mean their personalities as seen here. Anyways recommended to all anime fans, and to non-anime fans who are not familiar with anime yet, forget Dragon Ball or Pokemon, watch this."
tt0182629,"It is the tale of a wondering samurai warrior called Kenshin Himura seeking penance for his past crimes as an assassin known as ""Battôsai the man-slayer"", during the Bakumatsu (the final days of the Tokugawa government) in Japan.He seeks and finds shelter in the dojo of Miss Kaoru Kamiya. Miss Kaoru is the primary instructor of the Kamiya Kasshin-ryū fighting style developed by her late father, and she wants to resurrect that style of fighting.Kenshin himself is the master of the Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu style of sword fighting. He rescues Kaoru when she is in dire trouble with a local gang of thugs with is ferocious fighting style.Kenshin finds much in common with Kaoru and he moves in to stay with her. Kenshin is then joined by in later episodes with Sanosuke Sagara and Yahiko Myôjin. And so begin the adventures of Kenshin....This is my favorite anime of all time. It has plenty of lessons to teach us about life. The character of Kenshin is very humble and polite and at the same time full of courage and justice. He is dedicated to protect the weak and to uphold the law and fight oppression when necessary. There are 95 episodes in all, followed by 3 animated films namely Samurai X: the motion Picture, Samurai X - Trust and Betrayal, and Samurai X - Reflections. Overall full 10/10 and a historical masterpiece, a testament to that age, that honors those brave Samurai who perished on the battlefield and shows the suffering of those in that age. Kenshin may your ideals inspire the newer generations and may you always find a place in their hearts."
tt0182629,"Ruroni Kenshin is one of the best television cartoons ever made. Its characters are colourful and fun to watch, they're not your typical Shonen-cast of anime characters, and the fact that this series is a period piece makes it stand out from quite a lot of the other animes on the market. It's nothing like DragonBall Z, Naruto nor One Piece. THIS one focuses on Meiji-Period Japan; and a samurai who's vowed to never kill another soul again. This series is an appealing yet culturally- specific show that oddly works for a general audience. Its story is engaging, its direction fast-paced and never dull, and the voice-acting (of the Japanese cast) is pitch-perfect.This series is definitely worth a watch; even if you're not a hardcore anime fan!"
tt0182629,"Wholesome stories, with solid background history of each character, adding best experience i had in enjoying cinemathing."
tt0182629,"This anime has everything to be one of the best animes in the entire world. An amazing plot (and even based in the history of Japan), an incredible OST, and excellence in art work despite being made in 97', that transports you to the magic of Japan's 19th century.The plot revolves into very interesting subjects that keep being controversial in the contemporary society. Amazing how they could reflect XIX century's Japan's problems into our times.Character developing really takes a good part of the excellency of this anime. You get to the ending of it loving all of them, and wanting that it last forever. It is all very heart warming.You can also learn a lot of history watching this, as they make it interesting and it has a good base.The battles and the technics of the characters does not need to be artificial to make you feel impressed. Using only sword styles that existed all along Japan history, they'd managed to make every battle a masterpiece.Even the comedy is a genuine gem on this one, making you truly laugh.It's a must watch for all people loving this genre, no matter how old or young they are."
tt0182629,"There is one word to describe Rurouni Kenshin, Superb. It really is the best of the best. It deserves to be at the top of the top list for animes. Season one one really great, it was mainly about Kenshin saving the day, he fight people with great streghths, pirates, And his own friends. Season two got better, not that 1 was to good to be true. But kenshin was sent to Kyoto to stop Shishio from destroying the meiji government. Shishio kills innocent people and believes the weak die and the strong live. Kenshin fights through juppengatana, Aoshi, Saito and Sishio. He meets Misao on the way. Even kenshin friends help. Season 3 was good, but not the best. I've only seen parts. I need to order it like right now. But its starts off the same as season 1. Fighting off bad guys. Then this dude appears to be the son of god and uses the hiten mitsrugi sonic sword techniqes(If you didn't know that what kenshin uses). Also it's a lot more of a romance."
tt0182629,"I watched when I was a child , I liked this from then. Its cool fighting scenes, character design , that's it. But re-watched it last year and it was something entirely different. It is my favourite anime , No doubt about it"
tt0182629,This show is awesome there is a bit of blood and gore
tt0182629,"When I first saw Rurouni Kenshin, I was still relatively new to the world of Japanese animation. I had only seen a handful of series before, and though they all entertained me, it had yet to earn the same status with me as so many millions of anime fans claim Japanese animation to be worth. Rurouni Kenshin did that for me.The first 20 episodes or so were nothing out of the ordinary; A lighthearted comedy series, with a bit of action and drama mixed in. And even though these aspects were handled extraordinarily well, it wasn't anything remotely special. The animation was slightly mediocre, though not too bad considering, but the feel was nice. Good music, great characters and average plots, for a swordfighting anime. But with episode 28, the series made an incredible flip over. The change in atmosphere was shocking in fact, and took me completely by surprise. It was like a complete opposite of the episodes that had come before it. All of a sudden, the plot thickened incredibly. The animation went better. The storytelling of the images changed dramatically and the music went through the roof. (Well, at least for a Japanese animation newb like I was at the time)But all this was only to increase in the coming arc... The plot turned a lot darker, the lightheartedness was all but erased, and the animation increased incredibly. There's a lot of controversy about this change to the Kenshin fans. A lot of people seem to appreciate the lighthearted beginnings more. I am not one of those.. This new arc (Entitled the ''Kyoto Arc'') was indeed really masterful to me. It enchanted me. And to this day, Rurouni Kenshin ranks above the top of my favourite anime list.However, don't go rushing out and buy this; after this ''Kyoto Arc'', the series takes a dive for the worse. Apparently unable to keep consistent and on par in release speed to the original ''manga'' comic (Which was released at the same time), the animation studio had no choice but to continue with a self-created filler Arc. It was a tedious, boring and quite frankly annoying arc, which disgraced the beauty of before. Even worse: Bad ratings forced the company to shut and end the Rurouni Kenshin series, leaving the final arcs of the original manga (Which were just as powerful as the previous ones) unanimated and untouched.However, Rurouni Kenshin (Despite the mistake listed above), is truly a powerful series with a stunning storyline and great characters and I recommend it heavily. Though, if you're looking for some brainless entertainment with lots of ''cool'' action, don't go here. Rurouni Kenshin also pleases there, but you'll get a lot more out of it if you can appreciate all the series has to offer.(9/10)"
tt0182629,"Rurouni Kenshin is a refreshingly fun anime with wonderful characters and a great story line.  I would give Rurouni Kenshin 5 stars and two thumbs up...or shall I say ""Two Sakabatous up""?  I love when Kenshin says, ""oro"" or looks like a complete idiot by his friends.  The DVDs provide both the Japanese and English version, plus some very cool extras like notes, out takes and sometimes character messages (at the end of a season) or the openings or closings with out all those credits written all over them!"
tt1587000,"For shows this damn good the seasons just come to an end WAY too quickly. From the very first episode you're hooked, and streaming them is a pita cause you can't stop watching 'em. It becomes a marathon, and you only must stop cause you're seriously cutting into your zzz-time. Haven't looked it up yet, but I truly do hope this one stays around.. I know I could see myself enjoying it for a minimum of a handful of seasons...(but did read somewhere that more than likely three will be the last). There are so many outstanding performances, just select most any name, but just to single out one, and although she only appeared ever so briefly, Toni Collette shows in such an absurdly brief time how magnificent an actor she truly is, her range of character is just incredible. BRAVO Australia!!.. for such an outstanding production. Not all seasons are equal.. the third weaker than the the first two (prison doing a lot of the damage). Still pretty good overall, and had they allotted more air time to Adrienne Pickering .. bit.ly/1dvp5g5 .. (and TC), it could've been that much better. PS.. and I'm absolutely clueless why the US counterpart on Fox was ever produced and aired at all.. it is atrocious."
tt1587000,"Not being Australian and completely unfamiliar with Australian TV, I came to Rake without any expectations or preconceived notions. I find the show is hilarious and mesmerizing at the same time, in no small part due to Roxburgh's performance. He's terrific as a cad with a heart of 14K gold plated brass.In some ways, Rake is reminiscent of, but doesn't imitate, the great Robbie Coltrane series, Cracker, with both lead characters brilliant in their professional lives, yet exasperatingly self-destructive train wrecks once they're off the clock.The show's been Americanized by Fox, starring Greg Kinnear (an actor of whom I'm a big fan), but I'm avoiding the Fox series because I've been told the edge of the Australian original was sanded down for American audiences. But, it's the sharp edge that I enjoy. If you can get your hands on the OZ version of Rake, you ought to watch it. It's really good TV."
tt1587000,"Every once in a (long) while the Australian TV industry can dig up a gem. You're never quite sure which network will produce the next 'East West 101' or 'MDA', but chances are that an intriguing new show will turn up on the government-owned ABC. That is certainly the case with 'Rake', which I understand has been signed off for a third season - and is also the model for an American version to go into production shortly. I wouldn't have bothered writing a review for this series, but felt compelled to respond to remarks from reviewer colbur-1. Many of the actors making cameo appearances in this show are well-known names, as other reviewers have noted, but of the regulars probably only Richard Roxburgh would be well known outside the framework of this series. Regrettably, I don't see any of the ""cringeworthy jingoism"" or 1960s insularity. This is an immensely entertaining show if you can stand the robust language and moral ambivalence. But even in that context the heroic stature of Matt Day's character serves as a foil to Roxburgh's. The beauty of this series, beyond the wonderful character development, is that the stories overcome that stumbling block of Australian film and TV: mediocre script writing. Being based on reality and frequently drawing on true life situations 'Rake' eases willing suspension of disbelief even as it descends further into the surreal.It's a show that will shock and amuse; it's by no means a typical sitcom, but it's real life, with its flawed villains and cynics - mostly with their redeeming virtues. Even farm girl-turned-mobster and part-time lusty wench Kirsty - played by Robyn Malcolm - has her own reasons for her actions. And if that isn't enough to draw you in to watch this show, I don't know what will."
tt1587000,"but have rectified that with desperate anticipation driven out of absolute addiction.It is magnificently written, cast, structured and performed. What makes it most riveting to those of us blessed with living in and around the actual locations and situations, is that lots of the stories are absolutely true (given a few exaggerations here and there) with ""only the names changed to protect the guilty"".I can't imagine how they got filming permission for the scenes in the actual NSW parliament, when the story line revolved around the rottenness of our recently evicted government.If only the real party hacks were as funny as their corruption is real. Maybe we could actually forgive them. Instead they are dull, boring, incompetent and corrupt, very little amusement value there.Hard to imagine anyone ever playing the role of Cleaver Green to the hilt the way Richard Roxborough has. Having seen the dull, American rendition, makes Richard's performance only shine the more brilliantly.I hope there are many more series in the pipeline. This show is honestly the best I have seen in decades. Right up there with Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones. And a whole lot funnier! :)"
tt1587000,"This TV series tries not to lecture too much in order to recognize that people who are good at their jobs can have many other flaws. In other words, this series is very engaging because it has characters who are not wooden or black and white. Most characters in the show are somewhat dysfunctional and yet they have decent core values. And the most dysfunction is the main character who happens to be an excellent lawyer dealing with very difficult to defend cases or sometimes guilty people.The acting and the dialog is superb. Every single episode that I have seen has been well written and that is not always the case even for many great TV shows. This show also manages to incorporate comedy, drama and suspense very well.I love it and I wish that there were more episodes."
tt1587000,"I was overjoyed to hear this show is back, and stunned to realise I'd forgotten about it (although it's been a year without a season).Being reminded of its existence, let alone the prospect of another season, was enough to cause uncontrollable grinning.I love everything about it. The production values, the writing, the casting, the acting, it's all superb. But what I love most about it is the show's timbre; its aim and stance; its beautifully human angle. Many bonus points also for the regular moments of absolute hilarity.After watching the first episode of the second season, I can't wait for next week... this will get the long months waiting for the final instalment of Breaking Bad off to a good start."
tt1587000,"Just two eps into season three, ""Rake"" was looking like one of the best TV series from anywhere, ever. I was dimly aware of Richard Roxburgh as a veteran Aussie actor who's done a lot of action flicks; he's a revelation here as Cleaver Greene, a Sydney trial lawyer with a gambling habit, multiple substance-abuse issues and a private life that can only be described as a f---in trinewrick.The scripts are inventive and very funny, Cleaver's drunken harangues in inappropriate venues especially so; the cases are sometimes based on real-world causes célèbres (like the cannibal who advertised online for a dinner partner), the ongoing dramedy of Cleaver's personal life is involving (and very funny), and the ep where Cleaver gets out of a slump by defending an Assange-like activist who's charged with treason is positively uplifting.The supporting cast is amazing; Australian TV seems to have a very deep bench of beautiful actresses who can really act, starting with Adrienne Pickering as Cleaver's love interest and onetime Xena sidekick Danielle Cormack as a cougar prosecutor. Guest spots by Aussie notables like Rachel Griffiths as a race-baiting shock jock, Toni Collette as a randy politician and Hugo Weaving as the cannibal--and those crispy accents with the foot-long vowel sounds--make this fabulous show even more delightful.2018 update: All five seasons are now available for streaming on Netflix. Some of the later eps are a bit loosely plotted, to put it mildly, but the kangaroo court scene from season three (Rake makes the best jailhouse lawyer ever) is truly one of the funniest things I've ever seen!"
tt1587000,"The news that Series 4 of ""Rake"" is to begin on Australian free-to-air TV on 19th May this year has brought me out of the cupboard to comment on this series as a whole (so far.)Brilliant doesn't even begin to describe it. The names Peter Duncan and Andrew Knight as co-writers of much of the first 3 series' is generally a recipe for classy, tight writing. The concept, the delivery, the moral ambiguities, the lines nudged and then stepped over - it is all very, very Australian, and so typically modern Australia is it that perhaps it should not have been re-made with a US cast. The cast of this is universally brilliant, with Richard Roxburgh receiving a special mention from me, because any other actor may not have been able to walk that fine line between (almost) law-abiding citizen and absolute rogue, coming out after all his scrapes and gaol terms as someone we are prepared to forgive (almost) anything. The writing and acting of Cleaver Greene's relationship with his son is worth a special mention, in particular the odd turn this relationship takes in S.3 - just classic.I'll make mention also of the subject matter in Ep 5 of S.1, where Sam Neill guest stars with Heather Mitchell. It's the ""family dog"" episode, and on first viewing I thought, 'did I just see that, or did I imagine it?'. According to Charles Waterstreet, whose experiences as a Barrister in Sydney provided the inspiration for the character of Cleaver Greene, the case of the stolen DVD made by the good doctor and his wife was based upon a real life case. This is an instance of real life being far more outrageous than fiction.I can give this series - so far, at least - no less that 10/10."
tt1587000,"I tripped over this show on my way to the US remake, which caught my attention because of the presence of the always-likable Greg Kinnear. I'm very glad I tried the Australian original first. The US version is derivative and downright dreary; the original sparkles, with both razor-sharp satire and equally sharp-edged drama.Rake manages to fuse comedy, courtroom trickery, human drama and even some odd moral allegory. All these facets are apparent in the first show, when Greene must defend a cannibal (brilliantly played by Hugo Weaving) - who just happens to be a free-market economist, and who (like most free-market economists) sees nothing wrong with what he has done. In the next show, Greene tries to get an innocent woman convicted, then is forced to switch and get a guilty one acquitted. Then he defends a bigamist, who just happens to be a model husband - more than once.Greene's approach to the defence in each case is both clever and believable, in a way that most courtroom fiction is not. It reminds me of the best of Rumpole, with that series' ability to feel sympathy even for the guilty, and its reliance on astute legal trickery to make things come out 'right' in the end. Not to mention its ability to make us question just what 'right' means, in each case.Rake has immediately leaped onto my list of top ten TV shows *ever*. It's as funny, vulgar and painfully real as the brilliant British sitcom Still Game. Yet it's equally compelling dramatically. It definitely has things to say, but it slips these points in subtly, slyly, when you're not looking.Jack Lemon (speaking about The Apartment) said his ideal role was one that was both comedy and drama. That describes Rake perfectly. Richard Roxburgh may not be the equal of Lemon (who is?), but he comes through superbly as Cleaver Greene. The other roles are similarly well-handled, many of them by actors who will be very familiar to fans of Australian cinema.The US version of Rake seems like a quality production, and I may give it another try, though I admit I was unable to get through the first episode. The show seems predictably gutless, unable to embrace the moral ambiguity of the Greene character. Kinnear ends up playing a dysfunctional loser, where Roxburgh scintillates as exactly what he should be: a rake - an utterly likable rogue, a womanizer, a vagabond. A man who has no choice but to live by his own rules, and who adheres to no moral code but his own.I don't register a 10/10 rating very often, but in this case I felt like it was barely high enough. My advice: track down this show by whatever means necessary, and see it immediately.UPDATE: Rake is back for a 4th season. There's no question that the original brilliance has dimmed just a bit. The first season focused on legal shenanigans. Successive seasons have become more of an improbably Rake-ish soap opera. They're still a load of fun, but maybe in the 8-9/10 range. Still, the approach remains unique, and it's always a pleasure to see Roxburgh chewing up the scenery as the quintessentially Australian anti-hero, Cleaver Greene."
tt1587000,"Fun, steady stream of surprises. Some great acting and story lines. Cast seems to enjoy what they are working on. Do yourself a huge favor and don't start the 2018 season. It's just a sad, sham money grab. Kind of ruins what came before. It's like the writers never actually watched the previous seasons."
tt1587000,"While the cases in this series are over the top, believe it or not the main character in this is based on real person. Charles Waterstreet a Sydney barrister whose life is apparently every bit as colorful as the series would have you believe . Real life is stranger than fiction. Especially at the New South Wales bar, apparently. Waterstreet is mate of Richard Roxborough the star of the series who plays him in it. A younger and more handsome version as Roxborough smilingly says in one interview. The point is if you enjoy this series you should google waterstreet and find out more about him. As for me while something tells me he is the kind of guy who creates chaos in the lives of people around him, there is something about him that I find admirable and engaging. And this comes across in the show. PS love the show."
tt1587000,This show has got to be one of the most brilliantly written shows I'VE ever seen. The character of Cleaver is laugh out loud funny- his dialogue and those of others- make other tv shows seem like they were filmed underwater. It is outrageously clever and hilarious... Don't know what else to say but I'm so addicted... and I hope they keep this on for as long as possible. In such an age where politically correct bs seems to win the day- Cleaver's approach to cut things down to size is so REFRESHING. This is what TV was meant to be- not the other sorry ass drivel they pimp as tv... Thank the heavens for Mr. Cleaver and gang...
tt1587000,"Rake is an Australian TV show about an attorney, Cleaver Green, played by Richard Roxburgh, who is - no other way to say it - a complete mess. He's in terrible tax trouble and has been for a while, and has come up with every excuse as to why his records aren't available, so he keeps delaying. Meanwhile his secretary is stealing from him, which he knows, and they come to an agreement that she can only steal 10% instead of the usual 30.Green is divorced, and his main squeeze is a prostitute who later leaves the profession and winds up married to a politician. As far as his friends, he creates complete chaos in their lives just by showing up. When he finally gets permission to re-enter the home of Tom and Scarlet, he destroys their child's birthday party when he gets into a fight with the clown.On top of all of this, Green is an excellent attorney and really has some challenging cases - cannibalism is one; in another, a terrorist sets off a bomb and his wife is accused of buying the materials to make it, but she claims they are for her beauty business. ""Hydrogen peroxide,"" the Judge says. ""Bleaching hair,"" she says. ""It seems like an awful lot,"" the Judge says. ""Well, I don't want to be vulgar, Judge, but there are other places on a woman's body that have hair,"" says Green.At one point, he has to defend his own loan shark (who has had him beaten up several times).I recently found out that the U.S. did this series with Greg Kinnear. No way. I like Greg Kinnear but he doesn't have Richard Roxburgh's edginess and mercurial delivery or energy. Also I don't think some of the language - so prominent in the dialogue - would be permitted on American TV. Roxburgh is fabulous; the character needs to be not only super-smart but outrageous, and he brings it.The scripts are very well written, and I love the dialogue.Great series."
tt1587000,"I'm not typically familiar with Australian tv per se, I happened across it on Netflix. Omg this is fantastic. Funny, edgy - tackles the trials and tribulations of life - this is a must watch. Love it love it love it. Best series I have seen for a long time. Robyn Malcolm as Kirsty excels, as does Richard Roxburgh as the lovable rogue Cleaver Greene. Fantastic series."
tt1587000,"I find it amazing that good humor, clever quips and sitcom-style resolution can intertwine so harmoniously with the series' progressive storyline. That's not to say the series is faultless, but it throws a bewildering amount of emphasis on higher platitudes of comedy from within the excrement of distasteful satire. Conflicts are mostly grey-area in nature, which leaves the viewer with a mentally obtuse aftertaste that makes enjoying the show so much less a 1 dimensional fest of glut but rather a rewarding experience to boot.It's a terrific series, leaving me desperately fiending for more after each episode. If you liked Californication for the dialogue more than the sex, you'll love Rake for the same reasons, and you'll not be disappointed in either department. Rake in a nutshell: Clerks meets David Duchovney in suits with the stage set for silk."
tt1587000,"I cannot wait for more of Rake!
One of Australia's best comedy-drama-rampages through our bizarre legal system yet. I fear some of the storylines could be too close to the truth. 
Writer Andrew Knight is brilliant and I love his work. 
Congratulations to all involved and keep'em coming. I'll be glued to the Tv!"
tt1587000,"I had never heard of this show but stumbled on the title on IMDB and read some of the reviews (which were overwhelmingly positive) so I decided I'd check it out. I've been binge watching this show and laughing out loud at every single episode. If you share my sense of humor, you will love this show. The main character is fantastic."
tt1587000,"Really enjoyed the first three seasons.
Season four trailed off and season five seems pretty weak so far. 2 episodes in and it's borderline terrible."
tt1587000,"I loved the first 4 seasons, until crap started coming out the toilet, for the second time!! in the 5th season Seriously... don't they have any more better stories to come up with? I'm done watching this. It's a shame."
tt1587000,"I loved Rake from the start. The perfect mixture of humour, sarcasm, fabulous observational comedy and beautiful emotional commentary on human strength, weakness and the fragility of life. Series 5 is the perfect ending. While starting slowly, and certainly different from standard Rake episodes based in court, the series starts to take flight in episode 3 and then hits winning mark after mark until the end. Incredible writing underpins the wonderful performances, making this the ultimate reflection of Australian creativity and a unique voice as well as an indictment of the times in which we live."
tt1587000,SUCKS the first 4 are great the last season is unbareabull
tt0421357,"This anime is about two gifted brothers who are intelligent, kind and ambitious. They live in a world where Alchemy, and subsequently Alchemist, is the law of the world (vs. science in ours). With alchemy, one can do wonders... repair broken items....change physical properties of a matter...etc. However, alchemy is bound to one rule....one cant take (or make) a thing without giving something in return. With this simple rule, the two brothers go in a maze of exciting adventures, meeting wonderful characters and even sometimes, respectable enemies. The anime is 51 episodes long, which might seem a little too long initially, yet fortunately...each and every episode will tie you to your seat and make you crave for more. Story line is good, a mix of brotherhood, friendship, love, humanity and (like any other anime) the effect of war on people, not to forget the hilarious moments this anime is mined with. Character development is excellent. Drawing is top notch and music is entertaining. Unfortunately, this anime is not concluded after 51 episodes. The movie, and hopefully the conclusion, is to be release 23rd July 2005. This anime is worth every second....a must see."
tt0421357,"Whilst most anime is an acquired taste, falling into the fighting (think Dragonball or Bleach) magical girl (Sailor Moon) or romantic (Chobits) genres, Fullmetal Alchemist rises above all this. As the story gradually unfolds, you are drawn ever deeper into a believable alternative world where magic replaces science and its practitioners (Alchemists) are held in high esteem. Yet, few are what they seem and you cannot trust anybody. The good are, in fact, capable of deeds of great evil, and the bad are often doing what they do for good reasons. And just when you think you're getting a handle on it, something comes along that shocks you in such a way you are left thinking about it for days to come. Whilst there are obviously anime elements (the look, fighting segments) the story and, above all, the willingness to shock the audience by hurting and killing characters we have come to know and admire, make Fullmetal Alchemist well worth your time. Of course, you will have to invest a lot of time - 51 half hour episodes and a movie means 26 hours or so of viewing. But it is time well worth spending."
tt0421357,"I might as well just come right out and say it to start with--I have never been a fan of Anime. In general, I watch it if it happens to be on, but more as background noise than for the actual plot content. But this series changed my mind about all that.The first few episodes I watched were on Adult Swim. I liked the idea of magic being explained in a (somewhat) scientific fashion, so I found recordings of the aired episodes online (with subtitles) with the intention of watching them whenever I was bored.I say without shame that I, who have not watched more than a half hour of anime in a single sitting, watched all fifty-one episodes in a single sitting. And it had me sitting on the edge of my seat every time. When a few of the episodes were corrupted, I even edited the videos manually with a hex editor to get them to play properly.I was really turned off to Anime originally because of the way the Japanese animators use frame rates. You only really need one or two frames per second to show movement--and this contrasts with the relatively constant frame rate in American cartoons. It can look rather ugly if you're not used to it. For action scenes, though, they bring out the full 30fps, and the sudden contrast between 2fps, with the character standing there, and 30fps, where the character is executing these stunning martial arts moves, is an incredible sight to see.But I would like to say that this series is a complete series. The last episode does, in fact, contain the conclusion--no premature terminations here. Most anime contains a ""Lead-out"" which gives the viewer something to think about. It makes it seem more like the characters are still doing something, still living, even after the series is over. I must say that makes the end of the series even harder to bear, because believe it or not, it's like saying goodbye to a close friend.This series has definitely had a major impact on me. It is worth the time (or money) to acquire it. I wouldn't recommend watching all fifty-one episodes together like I did. The intrigue of the plot is intended to hit the viewers like a hammer, and it keeps them coming back week after week. If you watch them all together, it begins and ends so quickly you feel like you've been hit by a truck when it finally DOES end.Full Metal Alchemist is a prime example of excellent story writing. It'll make you laugh and maybe even make a few of you cry, but one thing it won't do is leave you disappointed."
tt0421357,"I was sick last year (2005 this is '06) for three days straight. So as a result I ended up 'channel surfing' all day and all night. I didn't get ANY sleep.Eventually I turned the channel onto Adult Swim. Mostly because I had seen the title Full Metal Alchemist and was drawn in. I remembered the myths about alchemy although vaguely mostly from random books I had read.The episode I ended up watching was the exam episode which should've been the actual beginning to the series but is actually around the third or fourth episode.And was hooked. I had thought that anime was a useless Japanese art form. Man was I wrong! Intriguing storyline AND amazing animation. This was an aspiring animators dream world.I ended up spending the rest of the year watching all the episodes on Adult Swim...I'd even wake up in the morning and think Full Metal Alchemist's on tonight! And plan my day accordingly. I also ended up buying the Manga which if you have cash to burn and love the series you should do so.The story itself is pretty straightforward at first and seems almost like Inu Yasha where there's the same premise behind every episode but that's only for a little while until you know the characters and than it starts adding to the background situations starts to show whats really going on and whats really behind their quest.The animation in itself just adds to the story with the rich backgrounds and the amazing fights.Overall this would be a good anime to start with if your looking for one. There's only 51 episodes, a movie -Full Metal Alchemist and the Conqueror of Shamballa- and a couple of games so it won't burn too big of a hole in your pocket."
tt0421357,"If I were to pick one word to describe FullMetal Alchemist, Hagane no renkinjutsushi, it would amazing, or ohmygod, or simply just a drop of the jaw and ""wow."" But that wouldn't do something this great justice. For those of you have heard this series can't compare with Naruto and Bleach, no, it can't, it's 100x better. This series will make you laugh, feel a very deep compassion for the characters, want to make you scream in rage, make you want to scream with happiness, and yes, even cry. Yeah. I cried a couple times. And the plot, oh yes, the plot. It's one of the best I've ever seen. Some might say it's too dark, I disagree, it's just honest. It explains that what's gone is gone, and we can't bring it back, people die for a reason, people die for no reason, life isn't fair, you only get what you give, all good things come to an end and we can only make the best of what we're given. Now the Characters, from Edward to Envy, Winry to Hughes, Scar to Rose, Riza to Roy, all characters have something special about them, and it will make you feel a deep compassion for them, weather it's Edward or Roy. Each character is developed and deep to it's full extent. The music is great, the Japanese voice actors are amazing, and the English Dub is one of the best I've seen. In short: If your an anime fan, or just dipping your toes, FullMetal Alchemist is a showcase of wonderful characters and plot, action, drama, tears and laughs."
tt0421357,"It has been 2 weeks since I have finished this series and the ending is still lingering with me. I heard that this was an excellent series from a friend so I decided to check it out myself. Well, all I can say is that FMA has exceeded all my expectations and have become my favorite anime in recent years. It has actually surpassed my other favorites including Neon Genesis, Cowboy Bebop, Berserk, Escaflowne, GTO, and even Gungrave which is second on my list. The writer and director of this series has such a wonderful imagination. I just don't know how they come up w/ these ideas. The voice acting (Japanese), writing, animation, music, and action is awesome. I just can't praise FMA enough. This is definitely a journey worth taking for all those looking for a good anime."
tt0421357,"When I heard of ""Full Metal Alchemist"" i didn't know what to expect! But only after watching the first episode I knew this series was special! From the start it drew me in and took me on a journey in to incredible adventures! It is the story that is truly amazing! At first the story is quite simple,but after a couple of episodes you will get some twists and turns you won't see coming! They managed to dazzle and surprise you almost every episode! Once you start watching ""Full Metal Alchemist"" you will not stop! The anime successfully mixed different genres (sciencefiction,drama,action,horror and comedy)! Also FMA throws in some serious subjects for us to think about and be entertained at the same time! But what really makes this anime works are the characters! A lot of attention is paid to them! The good guys,the villains all have their good qualities and bad qualities! Evil characters don't have to be pure evil! And the good characters also make mistakes! In that sense most of the characters are very similar to us humans and therefore are very appealing! This anime sure will make an impact on you on different levels! A MUST SEE!"
tt0421357,"Always been my most favorite show of all time and the only anime I truly love and care about. For a series that explores warfare and genocide, the darker tone and realistic atmosphere fits the series very well. I'm so glad that the directors and writers of this show adapted the mediocre stereotypical manga into a more philosophical, religious, and coming-of-age tale that is the original 2003 anime. I enjoyed how much the protagonists - those two alchemist brothers named Edward and Alphonse Elric - had more screen time which allowed their relationship and love for each other to blossom. The backstories, origins, and identities of the villains and were well done. Really loved how secretive, competent, and thrilling they all really were. There were numerous morals and sheds of gray throughout the show overall, rather than the usual lame old thin line of black and white seen in many other shows. The State Military characters were great as well, such as Roy Mustang, Maes Hughes, Kimblee, Shou Tucker, Maria Ross, Sheska, etc. Had the anime been following the manga directly from start to finish instead of deviating from the norm, it would have never had been this great. All of the major death scenes were handled extremely well and the ending to the whole show was beautifully bittersweet. The ending was by no means depressing and neither did it made you want to cry or anything like that. It was just simply bittersweet. Despite endless tragedy, the characters still believed in hope and made the best of their situations.Not only was the show depicting warfare, genocide, sin, redemption, and overall human nature maturely and realistically, but also a character-driven series as well as a coming-of-age tale for the Elric brothers. Unlike in the original manga series of the same name and its 2009 anime rebooted version, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, no character was a side character or a filler character. Each character played an important role, they moved the story on. The story felt neither too fast nor too slow. It was moving at a steadier pace, unlike many other anime shows, which allowed us to grow attached to the characters rather than the action. The show may have not had as much action, but when it did, it was so immersive and left a huge lasting impact, easily beating the several episode long fights featured in many anime, including Brotherhood. Each and every action caused by a character always came with a consequence in the end and tied up neatly, further proving how horrible the world really is. Each time there was an action scene, the characters were using their minds to think things through within the situation rather than just only their powers. The protagonists also often would lose against the antagonists, which made the show seem more realistic and believable. The show proved how much it didn't need conventional villains or fights being flashy/explosive or the characters being more bad-ass in order to be a good show.The show also didn't constantly hammer every piece of information into your head in terms of character dialogue like you're a preteen; neither did the show overused those annoying chi-bi comedy faces during any of the serious moments because the directors and writers knew those things only work in manga format, so therefore they wouldn't translate well into screen because they wanted you to be heavily immersed into what's going on with the characters and their surroundings. It was very subtle and trusted you to get it on your own. It only needed to tell the most important information and that's it. It never over-clarified what you needed to know just so you don't forget. It's only a matter of paying clear attention so that you can get what you need to know while processing through the show. When you are watching the show, do not expect it to be a roller-coaster ride from start to finish. This show will always keep you at the edge of your seat, just to see what will happen next and hell, even by the end, it will leave you with wanting more. The first 34 episodes of this show are based more-or-less on the first seven volumes of the original manga, but numerous differences and foreshadowing clearly indicted that the directors and writers knew they were gonna overtake the manga as the show went on. So yes, the anime did caught up with the manga which led them to two choices: either jump to filler or make up their own original story, the latter was chosen. Anyway, I just wanted to tell the directors and writers of this anime that I give them a big thank you for producing this masterpiece. I don't even see anything majorly wrong with it at all, contrary to the popular belief. The show's second half seems perfectly fine...to me at least. Once again, thank you to the show's writers and directors for the wonderful story, characters, villains, and oh...can I just mention one last thing how awesome the somber background music in this show really is?! It really fits the show very well."
tt0421357,"I used to watch this anime as a child. Of course I enjoyed the fantastic magical part of it, but despite everything I still remember the opening quote:
""Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is alchemy's first law of Equivalent Exchange. In those days, we really believed that to be the world's one, and only truth.""much more than just a cartoon."
tt0421357,"I don't think I've ever seen such an inconsistent show, I don't mean in it's plot I simply mean it's quality. My rating per episode fluctuated to crazy degrees and the average is a very underwhelming just above average overallFull Metal Alchemist is one of the premier anime series, hugely popular and I've heard no real criticism of. Sadly, I have plenty.It tells the story of the Elric brothers, two young boys who tragically lose their mother and attempt to use the art of alchemy to bring her back but with unfortunate consequences.It's scored well, the animation is great, the voice acting is flawless and it's full of genuinely interesting engaging characters who over the course of the 51 episode single series I came to care for.So why such a low rating?For start I hate the overexaggerated reactions, I don't mean how anime characters insist on shouting all the time I mean when they constantly break from serious animation to show a silly overdrawn facial expressions complete with symbols around their head. I really hate that nonsense!Next the plot as it develops begins to get a bit far fetched, yes I know we're talking about a world of alchemy but I mean the character additions, character behaviour and generally how an interesting plot gets convoluted to an extent it simply didn't need to.I like Full Metal Alchemist, I'm certainly glad I watched it. It has some fantastic qualities but it as a package deal is badly flawed and leads to a finale that left me scratching my head. Not because I didn't understand it, more that I couldn't believe 51 episodes has led to that and how ultimately it was a combination of moronic and mind numbingly stupid.Regardless I would recommend FMA, I just hope the sequel feature movie fills in the blanks that by all rights the show should have. And after that onto Brotherhood which I'm told is superior.The Good:Incredible voice actingSome very good ideasSeveral powerful momentsThe Bad:Silly expressionsLack of consistencyDumb finaleThings I Learnt From This Show:Edward might possibly be self concious about his heightAt no point did Edward during their long walks think it a good idea to get into Al (Then again when you put it like that...)I spent the entire show trying to work out if Envy was male or femaleAnyone who wants you to call them ""Führer"" is probably up to no good"
tt0421357,"Well, I can understand why anime fans love this series, but personally, it contains a lot of the stuff I personally *don't* like about anime. My main gripe is with the writing for some of the story lines. I do like the overarching series themes about equivalency, man's role in the world, and more specifically the adult themes of government corruption. However, I felt that the story lines to support these themes were poorly written, as if they were written by a child for a mature audience. For example, in that episode where there's an obvious rift btw Edward and Al, the reason for the tension is completely ludicrous. The method used for this is immature and clichéd, and is the type of plot vehicle used in really bad Jerry Bruckheimer action films to form a skeleton of story on which to base action scenes around. The end of the series has less of this type of trash writing, but it's quite a lot of garbage to wade through in order to get to a decent end.Overall, good action, cool adult themes, but bad writing from the beginning through the middle of the series made it a negative experience for me. I haven't watched much of FMA Brotherhood yet, but it looks like it's a reboot with less garbage writing, so I'd recommend skipping the original, and watching Brotherhood instead."
tt0421357,"When I had heard that Fullmetal Alchemst, one of the most popular cartoons in Japan was coming to America, I must admit, I was a bit excited.I had heard about it many times form several of my friends who were die-hard fans of anime of any kind. I myself am not a particularly big fan of anime - I enjoy one every so often, but this absolutely blew me away.The tragic story is of the two Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse (""Al"" for short). In a tragic accident, their mother is killed. Devastated, the boys decide to use the ancient art of Alchemy to bring her back to life - but there's one complication: The main rule of Alchemy. This rule of ""Equivalent exchange"" states that ""Nothing can be gained without first losing something of equal value."" The boys succeed in resurrecting their mother, but at a horrible cost - Edward's left leg is taken, as is Al's body. Desperate to restore his brother's life, Edward uses his own blood to inscribe an Alchemic circle in a suit of armor, binding Alphonse's soul to the metal. In doing so, he makes yet another sacrifice - his right arm is lost to the demons of the abyss.To recap - Ed loses his right arm and right leg, and Alphonse's body is taken. Now, you'd think that would be an equivalent enough exchange - two body parts and a whole body for their mother's life. But then you'd be wrong, of course. The thing they bring back is not their mother, but an inhuman creature composed of hastily put-together body parts - something that is human and yet not human. An abomination that cannot move or think on its own. From that point on, Ed and Al set out to learn the secret of ""Human Transmutation,"" the one Alchemic skill that would have any hope of bringing back their mother. But at a cost that they may be unwilling to accept...Overall, the series is gripping. Well-written dialogue, intense plot, and the best voice acting I've heard in a television series in a long time. Vic Mignogna, the actor who plays Ed in the American cast is absolutely brilliant - the voice he provides is believable and emotionally charged, a task most voice actors tend to fail miserably at. Aaron Dismuke, the voice of the 14-year-old Alphonse is excellent as well - not only does the irony of an adolescent voice coming from a six-foot-tall suit of armor succeed in getting a few chuckles, but the voice represents the character well. The voice acting brings the characters to life in a way that no other anime ever has before.Overall, it's an incredible series. I'd recommend this to anime fans, and fans of fantasy or sci-fi of any kind (unless you just can't stand Japanese cartoons). FullMetal Alchemist is definitely one of the best television series out there."
tt0421357,"When I first started viewing anime, I was at the age where anything action-packed was likely to impress. I regarded the classic DBZ and Gundam Wing to be the best anime ever made and quite frankly I did not agree with the later charts which placed Fullmetal Alchemist above all others. The name said nothing to me but the fact it constantly received comments of high regard persuaded me to watch it...It did not take more than the first episode to bring the realization that this was something of higher class. A superbly polished and well-built story which takes the viewer away from traditional level-up characters and fillers, combined with some of the best characters ever drawn make Fullmetak Alchemist a totem of originality. Whoever said anime are for kids has not been exposed yet to the sheer genius of this series. At the end of the viewing, the only regret for anyone will have been that only 51 episodes were committed to the story (and there is not one which can be called disposable). Fullmetal Alchemist sets a standard of anime which will probably stay unsurpassed for years to come."
tt0421357,"Full Metal Alchemist, about 2 loving brothers who get thrown into a world a war and war craft just to receive a certain something, which therefore leads them into a completely different world, and opinion of their objective.I have been a fan of anime for a while now, ever since I was very small watching Sailor Moon and Pokémon. But ever since then I was blinded from the world of anime and wasn't into it anymore.Well, until I contacted my long lost ex-girlfriend after about 6 months on MSN, I can seriously say I was hooked, for the first time in my life.So I downloaded all of the episodes and watched about 10 a day, my eyes couldn't move off the screen as they were fixed on only one thing, the show. Which then later got me into reading the Manga, well only the first 5 since I cannot find the rest.The story and it's characters go through so much. From Ed and Al longing for the philosopher's stone to revive their dear mother, to despising it on learning how to create it, then to learning on what the Homculus group is really doing to Ed and Al.I would definitely prefer watching this amazing Anime, then read the manga, believe me, it's worth the time."
tt0421357,"In 2003 a anime giant was born in the form of Fullmetal Alchemist. The first and one of the very few shows in general (not only Japanese or animated) to be well balanced. It got great action, but it also got great dialogues! It got great humor but it also got great drama! It got a great timeless soundtrack but once it also got great pop songs in the openings and endings!
It got it's flaws (particular with the ending). But even then it's balanced up! It's very hard to find a story THIS balanced in any media, and when I find a show like this, it just make my day better. I definitely recommend it."
tt0421357,"Coming from someone who used to say Brotherhood was his favourite series, I can honestly say this series is equally as good as the remake. In many ways this show's story and themes are much more mature than the more adventure focused 2009 series. It also has a superior soundtrack and stronger story boarding and colour direction.I strongly recommend new fans watch this series first!"
tt0421357,"Most of the anime series currently in release, let's be honest, are basically toy commercials. The characters are just kids playing with toys, showing the viewers how the games work, showing how much fun the game is, and whipping in repetitious plugs for game expansion packs. This magical adventure is a rare exception and a rare gem. The complex fictional frame has no other purpose than to provide a background for a brilliant and moving tale that combines the fantastic with dark human tragedy and indomitable brotherly love. Two teenage brothers, prodigies in the 'science' of alchemy, travel in the name of the state, looking for the philosopher's stone. The stone can amplify an alchemist's power, making it the object of both evil and noble ambitions. The brothers themselves want the stone to restore their bodies, one damaged, the other lost - his soul now inhabits an empty suit of armor - in an ill- advised effort to employ alchemy to raise their dead mother. Along the way, they meet an assortment of practitioners who use and more often abuse their power. This first instalment in the series was so interesting, so emotionally involving and so just plain different from so much current anime that I could not wait to get to the next disc. Highly recommended."
tt0421357,"Rewatched without skipping with open minded , actually better than last time i watched. Great villains and characters development. Few flaws on the plot but its alright. Great but not as perfect as the brotherhood. Recommended."
tt0421357,"I recently finished watching this anime, and it is absoutely amazing! Very well crafted story and strong characters. This anime is pretty dark and emotional and does a great job of making you care about the characters. I definitely found mysef shedding tears many times throughout the show.
The ideas and lessons in this show are also very thought-provoking. There is a lot of interesting commentary about discrimination, love, and fairness.
I also appreciate how every episode (with one exception of a more humorous filler episode later in the series) adds something to the story and builds suspense.
In terms of family-friendliness:
There are a few very mild s*xual jokes, and some awkward scenes in episode 10, but nothing too bad. The only thing that parents might be concerned about is the violence. There are a lot of frightening and emotionaly intense scenes, and a lot of blood. However, there is very little gore and guts.
Overall the only problem with this anime is that it's so good and suspensful, you will have a hard time taking a break to do productive things in the real world..."
tt0421357,"When I first went into FMA I really wasn't expect much and with the first 4 batch of episodes I wasn't really blown away, it just kinda looked like another generic shounen series. I was however increasingly impressed as it went along and came to like a majority of the characters and loved the plotting of the series. The series goes a lot darker and more dramatic than I initially expected but it worked well. The series proves once again why BONES is the finest animation studio in the world today. The series takes a little while to get moving and seems kinda generic at first but after it gets moving it is quite good. It has a couple problems with character development but excellent with plotting, decent animation, and decent soundtrack. Overall a great series but I've seen better."
tt2243973,"I've been a fan of the franchise long before the show came into being, and it did not disappoint! I love how beautiful everything is shot despite all of the horror and gore. The motives and emotions are intricate and the acting is a thing to behold.
Yeah, the third season could use a bit more plot to buff out the poetry but really, I can't fault it much. This is also one of the very few shows that has had a satisfactory ending!"
tt2243973,"After I started this series, my mouth was open, it was very good. I was amazed, the acting, the script, everything was perfect."
tt2243973,"I am going to say something heretical, so hold on to your seats. I thought that the Hannibal Lecter character in the movie ""Silence of the Lambs"" was extremely overrated. Subtle, he was NOT, that's for sure. Because of this, I really, really like the new incarnation of the doctor in this Bryan Fuller series. He is sophisticated, clever and, most importantly, a credible villain--not some bizarro dude going on about chianti and fava beans! In fact, the sophistication and style of this show is why I think it's a winner.I must point out, however, that ""Hannibal"" is NOT a show for everyone. Children should NEVER watch it nor should people who are sensitive and would be upset or offended by the carnage in the shows. Some of them are REALLY tough to watch--such as the mushroom people or the angels. Now I am NOT saying don't watch it--but maybe you should use common sense and not watch. Or, do like my daughter does, just avert your eyes when the gore hits a particularly high level...and it often does! Very well written, acted and directed--this is almost too good for network TV.FYI--My daughter has the Blu-Ray for season one. According to her, some of the shows are MUCH more graphic on DVD--such as the one with the musical instrument killer."
tt2243973,"Having seen the films based on Thomas Harris' novels, I couldn't for the life of me imagine an actor other than Anthony Hopkins for the role of Hannibal Lecter (although I had seen - and liked - Brian Cox' take on the character in Michael Mann's 'Manhunter' which was released before 'The Silence of the Lambs'). Apart from that, I didn't see the point in retelling a story that had already been told very well on film – and with outstanding actors. For those reasons, I deprived myself of the pleasure of watching 'Hannibal' until the second season of the show started - but boy: am I glad I finally got over myself and did start! To those who haven't watched it for the same reasons I didn't I can only say: knowing the storyline from the films (or the books) doesn't spoil this in the least; the writers cleverly play with your expectations and they have taken enough liberties that you can never tell what is going to happen. And Mads Mikkelsen makes for a terrific Hannibal. The cat and mouse play between him and Hugh Dancy's Will Graham is a thrilling joy to watch; the conversations between the two are an example of surgically precise writing where every word counts and could - literally – be a concealed weapon (the writing in general is top notch, especially the dialogues).Visually, this series is unlike anything I've ever seen; the opulence of the images seems to be directly inspired by the aesthetic of oil paintings; whenever food is served or you see the interior of Hannibal's mansion you're reminded of still lives from the Dutch Baroque; certain dreams, visions and hallucinations even recall the works of Hieronymus Bosch. Don't get me wrong: first and foremost this is a gory crime show about an exceptionally well educated and highly intelligent serial killer (and not some ""art show"") – albeit one with a very unique look.My verdict: 'Hannibal' offers gory thrills along with amazing images, fascinating characters and an outstanding cast. Perhaps the most visual – and visually daring – crime show ever. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
tt2243973,"This is more than a TV show, it is a work of art. The cinematography is amazing, it is filmed beautifully and every image is a well-thought-out picture. The dialogues are deep and full of subtle meaning, as the characters mostly try to understand each other's way of thinking or try to manipulate one another. Throughout the series Hannibal and Will get to know and understand each other and as a viewer you get to experience the same thought processes, as empathy is a major theme in the show.The images with dead people are so horrific but gorgeous at the same time that you find yourself mesmerized by the beauty of death. Also, the series finale is in my opinion one of the best ever. It is truly an amazing show."
tt2243973,"Mads and Hugh are perfect for the roles they capture in this series. They balance that fine line of love and disgust and adoration for one another - it's so beautifully done
I just wish this would of continued on after season 3
Definitely not for the weak hearted in regards to gore"
tt2243973,"Anthony Hopkins can be proud of having created one of the first original horror characters of the postwar era. His Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter has rightfully earned a place in the pantheon of legendary monsters. Hopkins was only the second actor to have won an Academy Award for playing a villain, the first being Fredric March for his remarkable performance in the rarely-seen ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (1931). The American Film Institute lists Hopkins' Lecter as the #1 screen villain in movie history.When I first heard about ""Hannibal"" the TV series, I cringed. Each installment in the film franchise had been exponentially worse than the one before. After Ridley Scott, Brett Ratner, Peter Webber--and even Thomas Harris himself--had tortured Hannibal near to death with their increasingly idiotic sequels to ""Silence of the Lambs,"" a TV series seemed like the sad, humiliating final nail in the doctor's coffin. Would this be ""Dexter"" redux, or another numbingly unoriginal CSI ripoff? Or worse, a tedious 5-season story arc following the personal trials of a young, idealistic, ruggedly handsome, perfectly stubbled Lecter as he spends 65 television hours' worth of time that I will never get back transitioning from noble psychiatrist to vengeful but justified killer? (Note to self: cock hammer, place barrel against temple, pull trigger.) Thankfully, ""Hannibal"" is everything I expected it not to be.I wasn't sure Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen--or any actor, for that matter--could play such an iconic character without being overshadowed by its grand progenitor (i.e., Hopkins), however ""Hannibal"" is so beautifully written, acted and directed that it transcends the inevitable comparisons. Hopkins played Lecter with hellish glee. He was the serial killer as prankster, a thinking man's Joker without the facial scars. Mikkelsen's Lecter is quieter and deadlier. He's almost like an alien predator, or a velociraptor in human form. When he smiles, you're probably about to die. Mikkelsen is chilling, funny, and blazingly brilliant. He totally makes the role his own, but that's not to take anything away from Anthony Hopkins. Asking who makes the better Lecter is like asking who's the best Dracula, Lugosi or Lee. They're both great, they're just different.I dislike police procedurals. They bore me. But ""Hannibal"" is different. There's something special about it. Bryan Fuller respects the characters and he understands the fans. He's given Lecter his first legitimate resurrection since ""Silence of the Lambs,"" and I am completely hooked. (And to think that we still have Eddie Izzard and Gillian Anderson to look forward to!)Fantastic show. High kudos to NBC for having the courage to air it."
tt2243973,"This show is exactly what I have been waiting for. It's unique, beautifully dark, and incredibly artistic and every sense of the word. The entire cast are amazing incredible actors! Mads Mikkelsen as Hannibal Lecter, who knew someone could portray him better than Anthony Hopkins. I've seen all three seasons over and over again and I am not bored! All I could ever ask for is a season foue and hopefully many more!"
tt2243973,"First of all, this has the BEST script EVER! a script worth to be learned by heart, the delivery, the word choice are so aesthetic.Then, the story is compelling, the BRUTALITY is tempting, the Music is fascinating, the elegance is inspiring, the cooking is appetizing ...Hannibal characterizes the natural perfection, his facial expression is so cold and lifeless yet shines with an unearthly abnormal confidence. He's a multiskilled person who has an encyclopedic knowledge, He honors his carcasses by displaying them in an artful piece and also by not wasting their organs.This series will make you have several EYEGASMS and EARGASMS ! This is not for the simple minded half wits of course !!!"
tt2243973,"Many will argue that Hopkins is ""the best and only"" Hannibal, much like folk declare allegiance to Bond actors.
But I like to think of each incarnation as seperate and of its time.
There's no doubting that Hugh Dancy's Will Graham is streets ahead of Ed Norton's earlier portayal.
Hannibal is easily my favourite Lector telling.
It benefits from two things;
The depth of field afforded the story by being a TV series and the ability to tap and reference the rich tapestry of what's went before.
Hannibal the TV series is exceptional, a prequel that feeds directly into a narrative that feels fresh and yet familiar.
Because of the intricacies of the known characters it plays out like a chess game.
Intelligence is sexy, murder is horrifying... Sexy horrifying is so alluring as an entertainment form.
The visual effects of this are mind blowing. I've never seen horror be filmed as artistically as this outside of Penny Dreadful.
For 3 seasons this show thrilled and entertained. Now we are anticipating a 4th season to emerge from the gloom of Covid-19.
Let's hope its writers have learned everything the original 3 seasons took in from the previous incarnations.
Let's hope we remain horrified, mesmerised and even rooting for the biggest and baddest anti hero of Modern Horror."
tt2243973,"Disclaimer - I didn't read the book(s)Season 1 is what you would expect from description and themes, pretty linear, pretty straightforward. There is a criminal of the week, crimes were over the top but interesting to follow. Hannibal is a looming shadow in the background until some realizations are made and the tables are flipped, not the most original idea but it works wellSeason 2 is essentially in-prison and out-prison bargaining, and I wished it lasted longer honestly. With some more criminals of the week to fill up the space and some shocking moments, topped with a finale which is rightfully rated as the best episode of the show. 9/10So Season 3 imo was the weakest of the three, 5/10, here's why:there were no more villains of the week, but rather villains of the first half and second half of the season and the latter was just a waste of time and space from start to finish, no one could've made that look good, the main reason why I watched last 5 episodes or so on double speed, and even that wasn't enoughthere is a lot of dialogue, not much from what was said really resonated with me. Lots of psychoanalyzing, seemed superficial and a way to fill up space. There is a lot of standing, sitting and talking, a jarring contrast to dynamic pacing of both previous seasonsin s3 there were too many characters to keep track of - Italian police and the rest of Italians, Chiyoh, Verger household, Molly and her son, Reba, Dolarhyde plus everyone previously introduced, it's a lot and really nobody got a conclusive story here and I still have lots of questions. Half of them served very little purpose, not one interesting person was introducedCharacters repeat the same mistakes over and over?so the finale. I laughed, I actually laughed. I lost patience with whatever's up with Will Graham somewhere around half of this season and didn't feel like diving deep. Needless to say, the final episode didn't really strike a cord here, except Hannibal's (and Will 's honestly) final (?) threats. An open ending, something I usually find not liking very muchAll in all, Hannibal Lecter gives this show a 5 solid stars and the plot shifts for the last season, some loved it, I didn't. One final pet peeve - for a show filled with horrors people survive a lot of injuries with little to no consequences."
tt2243973,"I remember watching this show while my friend and i used to commute. What started as a casual timepass soon turned out addict, and we couldn't wait watching a couple of episodes everyday.Good acting by primary and side casts. But its the antagonist who stole the show. Mads Mikkelson had surpassed everyone with his quirky acting and frantic skills. I mean we used to feel pity on his victims but that never changed our mind to hate him.A must watch."
tt2243973,"Truly superb writing, casting, acting, direction and editing. This show is a work of art. If you can, please watch in a quiet, intimate setting to truly appreciate the elegant horror being served. I have never been as impressed with a series as I am with this one. It's very surprising that a show this dark was on network television, I can't see the NBC viewer appreciating such darkness. I'm preparing for a second viewing of all the seasons. It was perfection to the very end."
tt2243973,"If you're wondering, this drama does not follow the story line of the previous Hannibal film franchise. However, it does not mean that the series doesn't pack its own punch in terms of tension and suspense. (I'm in such awe, I feel inadequate trying to leave a review for this show. I won't reveal any more than what is available on the wikipedia page.)Following protagonist Agent Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) into his mind and peering into the distorted lives and actions of serial killers, he comes across as a highly intelligent but often conflicted man, tormented by his own imagination and yet has to live it each day for the greater good. This sense of vulnerability and instability caused by his personality (largely introverted and antisocial) is preyed upon by his psychiatrist, famed Hannibal Lecter, excellently portrayed by Mads Mikkelsen, and as all this is played out, the audience, privy to this knowledge will be gripped by suspense, and the never ending tension, even on scenes where nothing appears to be happening, the mood takes on a somber and tense tone. For those who are concerned with the relative 'low level of gore', be patient. It takes its time to build and slowly escalate, bringing Graham deeper into the shadows and mental torment.I can't emphasize how good the acting is, how vivid and artistic the abstract dream and killing sequences are. the fact that the soundtracks are well selected and not obnoxious all plays a part in creating one of the best viewing experiences ever. As a fan of psychological horror, I feel privileged to be able to take a small peek at this show ahead of broadcast."
tt2243973,"Before watching this series I wondered ""Why in the world would they try to recreate the Hannibal movie series? It's been done! It's over! No one can replace Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal!!"" Boy was I wrong. Mads Mikkelsen shows off some seriously unique acting chops throughout this entire series! I absolutely hated him in the Bond film Casino Royale(In a good way!) I hated him because he was so twisted, evil, smart and cunning as the villain and all those traits are magnified throughout the 39 episodes of this series. It's gruesome and horrifically violent and even though I was cringing because it seems so realistic I was simultaneously wildly-entertained all the while! There simply isn't enough time to tell the full Hannibal story over 3 movies and appreciate all the details so I realize now this 3 season series is entirely justified. As someone who's suffered with ADHD for most of my life I also appreciate the mental health aspect behind this series. with the time of a TV series you get a chance to go under the hood of Hannibal the psychiatrist and in a 2-hour hollywood movie there just isn't enough time to dig deep into mental health in what separates Special FBI agents, serial killers or average ordinary people. I found the whole series thought provoking and very interesting."
tt2243973,"I don't know how many time I've watched it, it's just a master piece. The visual is incredible and the casting and character are sooooo great. Bryan Fuller is such an artist I love him for giving us this show."
tt2243973,"Visually arresting to watch especially with the soothing music and incredible acting! Hugh Dancy is electrifying, I love the way he solves crime scenes and the fact he seems to have Asperger's which I have too. The nightmares are spellbinding and visual effects are one of my favorite things ever done! Hannibal is written with brilliance throughout; I'm so hooked to this charming elegant show."
tt2243973,"We have come through the last couple of years with some excellent TV programming. dialog, writing, directing, acting some of the episodes if not entire seasons trashing anything that was showing at the local megaplex. Just like most here I was highly skeptical at the idea of a made for TV Hannibal, as Robert Downey is to Iron Man and Hugh Jackman is to Wolverine.......for me Anthony Hopkins was to Hannibal Lecter. Well no more. When telling people about this show, that's what I use as an approach. When you think of Hannibal Lecter you tend to think of Anthony Hopkins. Well not anymore, what a tribute to Mads Mikkelsen that he could take this amazing pop culture character and and so firmly attach his name to it. If you have been skeptical or just not ""seeing"" you're doing yourself a great disservice in not checking this out. I absolutely LOATHE that comcast now charges for past seasons of network shows, but this is the only one that I would ever say is worth purchasing and viewing before season 3 gets here. Hannibal is excellent television."
tt2243973,"Blown away; the acting, writing, cinematography, just perfect!! Mads Mikkelsen is a genius."
tt2243973,"Seasons one and two were very well written, encaptivating, and exciting. But it stops there. Season three was just awful. The storyline didn't match the same level as prior seasons."
tt2243973,"Don't get me wrong - I kind of want to like the series and most of the time it's okay, but there are things that just can't go unnoticed and drag the rating down. It's like watching a horror movie and wanting to scream ""don't go there!""Apparently all the characters are written in such a way that everyone's an idiot and lack common sense. Everyone except Hannibal. Nobody leaves a note or shares a suspicion before investigating him and/or making a move on him/feeling in danger. What do you do when someone's accusing someone of horrible murders and you start having suspicions of your own? You tell them everything, of course! And then when you break into their home and put yourself in danger what do you leave behind in case something happens? Right - nothing.I really like the idea and overall style of the show, but some things are waaaay too stretched just to make Hannibal artificially 'out of suspicion' and drag the series for as many episodes as possible, milking it like a cow. 
And that drives me nuts."
tt2243973,"I would like to thank Fuller and the rest of the crew and cast for granting us with such a show with such advanced (and beautiful) cinematography, superb acting, and an intriguing relationship with the two main characters especially. So intriguing, that, if not for a fourth season, we are only left to wonder just what happens next. Every character changes (for better or for worse), and seeing how that affects their ultimate fate is makes me want to watch the whole thing again. (On second thought, I will.) Now if you're debating on watching this creation, I only ask that you give this a strong chance. For there was (and still is) much potential to impress audiences; those who like complexity, drama, and a bit of gore, of course. Overall, a worthy successor to the story of Hannibal Lecter...and friends."
tt1526318,"I'm a big fan of the series, but it probably helps that I'm the only British politician (I was an MP for 13 years) who grew up in Denmark. To complement rather than repeat the other reviews, a few words on how realistic it is.The multi-party negotiations are entirely plausible - that's how Danish politics works, and there are parties that switch allies from time to time. The balance between idealism and scheming is also really well done - most British and American movies and TV series portray all politicians as ruthless power-mongers, but generally politicians like to think they're doing the right thing, just like anyone else. The character are recognisable types - in particular, the far-right leader is clearly modelled on Mogens Glistrup, the entertaining, folksy and erratic founder of the current Progress Party.The series is maybe a bit weaker on the big political issues, since it has to tackle something complex in an hour, and an issue like Afghanistan can't really be analysed in any depth in that time. The episode on a thinly-veiled Sudan with the smooth, corrupt Northern leader and the plausible Southern leader with some uncomfortable views is gripping but stereotyped. But it works brilliantly with smaller issues, especially those that interweave with the private lives of the protagonists. Above all, it creates sympathetic yet flawed political figures with a non-political private life, so much more like real politicians than the one-dimensional figures that the media try to make us."
tt1526318,"It is just impossible for me to find the words to describe this Danish television series. It gives an incredible in-depth (and probably honest) view of politics, one you have never experienced before. After watching the first season of this show, one is already deeply impressed by the acting and the story line. Guess what: season two even beats season one. The private life of prime minister Birgitte Nyborg gets a more important part. Young actress Freja Riemann is magnificent as her daughter Laura. Also the other actors are of extremely high standards. To mention a few: of course there are Sidse Babett Knudsen (as Birgitte Nyborg), Johan Philip Asbæk (as Kasper Juul) and Birgitte Hjort Sørensen (as Katrine Fønsmark) in the leading roles, but smaller roles - showing great acting - are played by Ole Thestrup (as right wing politician Svend Åge Saltum) and Peter Mygind (as the chief of the tabloid - low quality - newspaper Ekspress). Television can not get much better than this. I'll be looking forward to the third season as I've never been looking forward to any television series' next season before. This series is an absolute must- see!"
tt1526318,"I am not one to watch lengthy part series - not at all!! This one just grabbed me and held me tight. The Danes and Sweedish do quality TV, especially in casting and character direction. Compared to many US productions, where characters are often like cardboard cut-outs, this series gave us believable real live human people. Brilliant photography and beautiful direction.The story too was very well crafted, looking deep into human behaviour, morals and ethics in power, and the consequences of actions taken.It is a series I will watch again in the future, if just to enjoy the rich texture.I highly commend the production team and recommend this excellent series."
tt1526318,"I have rarely felt such complete commitment to a series. The acting is outstanding. The mix between media and the heart of politics is so cleverly well done it covers drama with reality at a top level. Every single actor in this series deserves high acclaim. The skill from the writers and producers is at gold medal level. A powerful intelligent full package in entertainment, drama and real life."
tt1526318,"We all know a great TV show when we see one and this one is a great one. I am so tired of American drama that seems to all be written by one crew and all has one plot of killing a person then trying to figure out who did it. Borgen has gripping dramatic plots that is accentuated by great acting. The acting is intense and spectacular, and you have to see it to believe it. The dialogue is well written and the scenes are addictive and gripping. And no commercials or loud sickening music that is needed to keep the audience watching most of the cheesy American TV series. All the characters have there own personalities and show a sense of individualism that is so very refreshing."
tt1526318,"I've always liked Danish cinema: the properly written stories, the superb acting and the well developed turns which yet do not seem unbelievable. Having been curios whether the quality I got used to can be attainable in a television show I decided to give Borgen a chance. Now I wish I didn't : I unfortunately became addicted. :) Since others wrote so many things about the first 20 episodes I wish just to continue focusing on the last 10.I have to admit that I was really afraid of watching the third season. Having read unfavorable opinions I just did not want to spoil the satisfaction which I felt on finishing the second one. But seemingly against all odds I got deeply impressed again. Surely, politics and real world problems occupy sometimes a too big stake with questions getting debated on at a speed one can not easily follow, but the characters remained likable, flesh and blood, and the screenplay do not let them down. Sidse Babett Knudsen's performance is impeccable as always and Brigitte's way towards inventing herself again in politics as well as in personal life provides enough fuel for the story. I can imagine that Danish viewers find some detail exaggerated or too shallow, the presented relations or roles too embellished compared to the reality and the style on some places preaching but I just live in a country where the quality of the politics and the media is extremely low, the people vested with high positions can hardly be revered and the decisions made on governmental level are too often arbitrary. It was therefore interesting to see that there are places where this sector can be approached without any chance of laughter coming from the other side."
tt1526318,"I have so enjoyed ""The Wire"", ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Killing"" to name a few, that I absolutely had to post this, my first review. Borgen is totally absorbing.The human characterisation is immense and is simply the best (in my opinion) series, film, broadcast I have ever seen. Thank goodness for subtitles!It is a fascinating insight into how government works in a democratic society and how it ""maybe"" deals with so many issues that affect us all. If you hate politics and politicians, this series will temper your feelings. My scepticism and my cynicism towards government will not be as entrenched as it has been having seen this production.Superb acting by all the cast. Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant!"
tt1526318,"Borgen is a superb TV series, topical issues, political intrigue, terrific actors. The political shifts are totally credible. The development of characters in this series is truly impressive. They're rounded out, they have real depth. This is true not only of the central characters but the more minor ones too. The relationship between the media and high office is also convincingly portrayed. The way in which personal lives are impacted - particularly of course that of the Prime Minister's - has real emotional charge. BUT - and this is so important!: what on earth happened to the person responsible for sub-titles in English in Series 2? This is absolutely appalling,almost impossible to follow the story line without the subtitles. How did this go out without anyone spotting it? A really shocking flaw in so marvellous a production."
tt1526318,"Borgen is a Danish political drama, similar to House of Cards, and may be the best political show I have seen! The show focuses not only on politics, but on the lives of those involved in it, including their families, and their personal struggles.I just got through binge watching seasons 1-3 in about a week, and just heard the news that a fourth season will be coming in 2022!"
tt1526318,"Some cheap plotting, saved by superb casting, acting, videography, editing, music. Overall, the best recent TV series, but that isn't saying much, is it? Third season, weakest. African episode, way over the top; also, Jeremy and Brigit in Hong Kong (silly)."
tt1526318,"Politically the show is ridiculous. Throughout the episodes the prime minister role regresses as a person and shows a disappointing character. Everything she does is to stay in power. The mix between journalism and romance of two characters is caricatured and worthy of rotten scenes. In addition to being cynical, the PM's character is a liar and a model of a mother who shouldn't even exist in fiction. The screenwriter of the ridiculous peace negotiation should become a consultant in the negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians due to his skill and speed in resolving conflicts. It doesn't take 30 episodes to show the rot of the political world. It is tiring and discouraging."
tt1526318,"I didn't watch the West Wings (Sorkin's style annoys me), so understandably I feel equally lukewarm towards the ADHD fast-talk-fest of Newsroom. I can't stand House of Card's format with Spacey talking at the audience. I find Veep funny but repetitious. All of which my wonky other half watch with glee. I watch Scandal, yes, but Scandal is not a pure political drama, but a fast-paced raunchy fashion show soap opera with spin-doctoring toppings. So basically, a political drama has to be really exceptional to keep me.Borgen, is close to being a PERFECT work of its genre, AND as a dramatic piece of work. All the right ingredients - the casting, the framing, the setting-up, the tension, the exposition of complicated back stories, the pacing, the editing, the continuity, the humanity, the suspense, the humor, the angst... Sleek, non-preachy, lots of culturally-specific yet totally relate-able pains and joy, just the right depth, just the right amount, to keep the interest, to surprise one later on. Lots of reference to US political history, edu-taining snippets of where Denmark is in the scheme of European politics. But also enough heart-breaking yet un-sentimentalized domestic drama and complicated yet un-cheesy romantic entanglement to allow for intimate connection with the key characters. My only complaint is (I'm only at 2nd season start) the obviously alpha-female leading lady is emotionally too wimpy when dealing with matters of the heart, and the improbability of a head of state of a rich nation having no government-paid nanny or private tutor for her kids. But overall, delivery and the cast performance is as sleek and smooth as the spin doctoring in the story, qualities this genre calls for.I just heard American TV (HBO?) is looking into adaptation. But of course. I hope this adaptation will be as good and 'true' as my current most favorite US TV show, another adaptation - of the Swedish work, The Killing. What's with these Scandinavians. They write exceptionally effective TV shows. Congrats, anyhow, the Danes. Highly recommended, for the political/ legal/ media drama sort. Totally worth the extra step of reading English subtitles."
tt1526318,"In many countries, this century has seen dozens of political dramas where ""dry"" politics does not prevail, it is rather a background/motive/reason to picture human relations and their changes proceeding from changes in circumstances. Borgen is a fine Danish example of respective matters, without the simplified approach ""bad politicians - good journalists"", and that even famous people at high places are humans and personalities, with their ups and downs, feelings and sexual life. Of course, Denmark is more ""open"" here than many other countries and only a few positions are separated from ""ordinary"" people by security guards, but still... Apart from sharp and logical script, there are diversified performances, beginning with Sidse Babett Knudsen as the protagonist Birgitte Nyborg Christensen up to less frequent appearances by not less famous actors such as Lars Brygmann, Jens Albinus, Lars Mikkelsen - to name a few...True, there are some trivial elements available almost in all Scandinavian crime series (e.g. Child molestation) and there are several similarities with Adam Price's previous creation Anna Pihl, but nevertheless, Borgen is a series that could be mandatory for both viewers and politicians, particularly ahead of any elections. Because not is all as it seems when power and fame come into question.PS Season 3 is strong comeback, even ""green"" topics are depicted in a sensible, not annoying manner. And SBK steals the show everywhere, sometimes perhaps too much..."
tt1526318,"The human side of politics and price of power. So well written, directed and acted. Yes, the subplots are not genius, but the show is outstanding as it shows how well-meaning, responsible people can be corrupted and consumed by power. Unbelievably well made!"
tt1526318,"The international success of Danish political-crime thriller 'The Killing' perhaps played a major part in the UK screening of 'Borgen', a drama set entirely within the Danish parliament. And the two shows have something in common, in their relatively unhysterical portrayal of political life (and for U.K. viewers, an intriguing insight into how a political system might evolve when locked in a state of permanent minority or coalition government). I loved the wheeling and dealing in both series, but (aside from the lack of a killing alongside the politics in 'Borgen') there are differences. In short, Borgen, with its fantasy liberal prime minister, beautiful people, and stories wrapped up in self-contained episodes, is just a little bit slicker than 'The Killing' was; and I don't mean that as a compliment. But this is comparing it to a very high standard. There's still some good acting, some clever scripting, and a subtle portrayal of the increasing loneliness of life at the top: you can imagine that this is the way that government really is run (although perhaps the programme also tells us something about how the Danes would like to perceive themselves: 'The Thick of It' could not have been more different but also rang true, and I can't believe that Danish government is so utterly different from that in the UK). It's still riveting entertainment; and moreover, seems to have anticipated the actual outcome of the recent Danish election."
tt1526318,"After watching the sixth episode of this series, I continue to be impressed with the political drama with its impact on family and personal relationships and excellent script. As a close political observer, I can totally sympathize with the prime minister whose personal integrity shines; however, she has to balance the policies of her left of centre party with the realities of government. No easy chore, given the nature of coalition politics that she must navigate. It is set in Denmark, but the uneasy alliance is typical of minority Parliaments we have seen in Canada as well as the standoffs in the United States between Presidents and Congress. Denmark is a nation committed to democracy so the conflicts and characters ring familiar but the drama is every bit as evident as The West Wing or Madam Secretary. The language transmits well with the captioning of the wit and repartee that is a strong part of the script. The prime minister's aide is a political spin artist who creates the talking points for every controversial decision. In the meantime, he is caught up in a serious relationship with one of the nation's leading television journalists, a sub-plot that is also fraught with personal pitfalls and the need for objectivity. The relationship of the prime minister with her family is very moving and the viewer realizes the sacrifices that are part of being a public figure and how family and public life are on a constant collision course. She manages her personal life very well, just as she manages the political fallout from being in a position of power. The prime minister has amazing wisdom and grace but one can imagine how gruelling the life can be. Her husband is as committed to her and her politics as any man could be. It takes a toll however. For example, having to sell his shares in a wind energy investment that is about to take a big jump on news that the government is on the verge of a major breakthrough. He and the Prime Minister are able to make the compromises necessary to ensure their marriage. When her father comes to visit, and lonely after a recent divorce, she is the one who has to let him know when it's time to leave. All in all, this classic television show highlights in a realistic and entertaining way the management of political and personal conflict and the daily drama of the people caught up in a life in politics."
tt1526318,"I have seen series one (i.e. episodes 1-10).This drama portrays the parallel developments in the formation of a new government in Denmark, and the activities of the major TV company TV1 where we see the newsroom. In each case there is a strong female lead seeking to balance the demands of ethics and principle, against the realities of their day-to-day working lives. There is also considerable coverage of how the demands of politics affects the home life of the first female prime minister.The spin doctor character provides a direct link between these two worlds (as the PM's adviser, and as the ex-boyfriend of the journalist).The writing was very sharp (perhaps particularly in the first half of the series). I don't think the political elements are as unrealistic as some seem to be claiming, but neither is it a documentary and clearly some aspects ring more true than others. The episode concerning Greenland I know had many people reaching for information about that topic.Appointment viewing for the 5 weeks over which it was shown in the UK."
tt1526318,"The show follows the newly elected Prime minister of Denmark Birgitte Nyborg and her Spin- doctor Kasper Juhl. While the first season was criticized for being a far cry away from any realistic depiction of politics, the second season have climbed to be a great story about the life of politicians in Denmark. While the drama is sometimes is exaggerated compared to that of real-life (which is to be expected) the stories are however quite believable as many of the themes are inspired by true stories and problems Denmark's politicians have faced during the last 20 years. While the characters went from stereo-types in season 1, many of them have grown into dynamic believable characters in the second installment. If one can survive the pretentious opening titles and the dumb-wise Machiavellian quotes, the sopping drama from time to time, especially in the first run, second season we offer a rich and engaging story which must be applaud for its eminent storytelling and drama which is both entertaining and relevant for anyone interested in politics. Also one should not forget that this is a drama, not a depiction of real politics in the traditional sense, but is much more focused on the human cost and complications of being a politician. Cliché? perhaps but it's still being well executed. A fine 7/10 is rightly awarded here."
tt1526318,"This is a well written series but it fails to inspire. The story line takes a back seat to the sophomoric personal dramas that are front and center in every episode. Who cares about the "" friction "" between the characters?? The continuous and obviously concocted conspiracies make what could be a very good show into a pantomime. How it received such stellar reviews seems to be gender driven .. We all appreciate capable people and the fact that women are now being singled out just because they are women makes me cringe ... If you want to see strong women portrayed in roles of intelligence and strength then switch to Bordertown a much much better series."
tt1526318,"A couple of decades ago the expressions Danish political thriller and Swedish action movie were used to conceal adult entertainment. Borgen defies these old jokes by being an exquisite political drama.If you've seen The Killing (Forbrydelsen) and felt that there should be more politics than crime, then you're in the right place. I understand that the same authors have been involved, but without further analysis, i'd say that the atmosphere is the same. Besides, you'll encounter some actors you've seen before.Borgen follows the lives of ordinary people involved in politics and media and other visible and not-so-visible individuals that shape our society. We see how they change and how their careers influence those around them.Given that Borgen comes from Danemark, which is among the best regulated countries countries in the world, it is interesting to see that there are some things that are universal. Namely, the politicians almost exclusively care about their career and the media are merely looking for a new story for their next edition."
tt2359704,"I'm not that crazy about shonen in general, but there's something about JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE that just hooks you. It's so over the top, so surreal, and yet so emotionally earnest that one cannot help but be caught in its spell."
tt2359704,"JoJo is one of the weirdest and most entertaining anime's out there, and yet there's an emotional core to it. When people always talk about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure they always just talk about the memes or the great openings or the ""Enemy stando!"", but there's so much more to why people (including myself) love JoJo.
Yes the memes and ridiculousness of JoJo is a ton of fun and certainly gives it the personality it's now become infamous for, but there is some truly incredible writing and characters in here. Plus because of the way the parts are laid out each one is unique and different, so if you didn't like the previous part then you'll probably like the next, then again literally every part is good except maybe the first. And the animation and music by David production is all fantastic."
tt2359704,"Generally, Jojo's Bizarre adventure is a title that have an incredible variety of situations through its stories. But Golden wind consolidates the work that Hiroiko Araki was doing since the series started, not just in a matter of drawing style, but in his narrating style.Entertaining and thought-provoking through the stands of all of the characters, you are always thinking about how our heroes can defeat that enemy, the amazing and imaginative ways that every stand user control his/her stand (Specially Giorno, our central character in this ""season"") are completely fascinating. Mix all of this stuff with a catchy gang story and you have a gripping and incredible masterpiece that is still a must read on Japanese manga history"
tt2359704,Holy I can't express how much I love this it's a masterpiece it's memes it's sound effects the dramatic letters and the fact that there's like 3 more parts for this series is very anticipating I recommend that you watch this anime it's very very good
tt2359704,"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has been a ride for me. I got into it, because of it's massive Impact on the anime community as a whole and how it bends the rules of traditional anime and makes me laugh and sob at the drop of a checkered hat. Stories in traditional ""shonen"" or ""for boys"" anime fall into obvious tropes that JoJo does not. Normal anime will follow a main character (mostly male) trying to solve a problem through fights. JoJo follows that guideline with some major improvements. When following one main character you run into the problem of the story becoming boring or the main character becoming so overpower that they seem not likable because they run out of the faults that make them human. JoJo switches off the baton of the main focus of the story with it not being about one Joestar, but a family of Joestars. Each Joestar has one problem to solve and a loads of amazing support characters that make this a lovable and amazing series pretty much perfect for me. that being said, I know this show is far from perfect with it's many plot holes and unfinished stories, and lets not talk about the way far away things look in the anime, but in my eyes this story of a family overcoming trials and tribulations is just enough for me to call it my favorite piece of fiction."
tt2359704,"I love it so much. I didn't know if I would when I started watching it, but as it went on I loved it more and more. It has great and memorable chatacters, stylish visuals, cool strategy-based action, incredible music and many dead dogs. Here are some quick thoughts about each part:PHANTOM BLOOD: The first three episodes are a masterpiece. Drags a bit in the middle, but sticks the landing. Speedwagon rulesBATTLE TENDENCY: Joseph is great. Stronger and better paced than Phantom Blood, but it does drag a bit towards the end.STARDUST CRUSADERS: Long, epic, incredible. The introduction of Stands changed the game. The crusaders are unforgettable.DIAMOND IS UNBREAKABLE: My favorite part. I love the colors, the characters, the villain. Great Days is my favorite Jojo opening. A truly beautiful Duwang.GOLDEN WIND: As always the main team is great. The torture dance is one of the finest pieces of animation ever created. Polnareff is turtle.The Rohan OVAs are also great.
I can't wait for Stone Ocean."
tt2359704,"I've got to be honest, the first few episodes had me doubting what exactly what I was watching. I decided to stick through it and man...I'm glad I did. One word to describe this show....unique. I haven't watched the whole series yet, but with each episode I get that ""what happens next"" feeling. I am still relatively new to watching anime (I've watched a few series), but I can definitely say this is one I enjoy."
tt2359704,"This show is one of the most influential series to come out of japan next to dragonball and fist of the north star. It is the reason we have games like persona or great fighting game characters like guile or juri. Jojo's bizarre adventure has influenced popular anime like One piece, Hunter x Hunter, Yu Yu hakusho, and Shaman king. One of the most unique things about it is its a different story with a different protagonist each time while still having a lore and continuity. This makes it impossible to judge based on a single or even multiple seasons the best parts are 7,8,2, and 4. one of the coolest things about JoJo is everyone who's a fan likes different parts one person could love part 5 and hate part 6 while another person could have the opposite opinion everybody loves part 7 though. all in all there's no other anime like this one it actually tends to appeal more to non anime fans due to its western feel."
tt2359704,"Don't know why this anime was split into parts 1 and 2. I just watched episodes 1-26, so I'm going to review it as one show.It starts with a rich family (the Joestars) adopting a poor boy named Dio. Dio is the same age as the Joestar's son, Jonathan, and they become fierce rivals at everything trying to get the attention of Jonathan's father. Initially, Dio is better at everything, but as they grow up, Jonathan catches up to Dio, making him bitter and twisted. One day, he finds a stone mask, that when attached to his face, transforms him into an evil vampire...The shows stretches over 3 generations of Joestars and each son is nicknamed Jojo. They spend their lives fighting vampires and other, stronger immortals.What I really liked about this show was the humour. The characters were all great and the animation and action scenes were awesome, but the humour turned what could have been a dark, horror type story into something really fun. Normally, I'd prefer them to have left out the humour and gone down the dark path, but in this case, it really works well. Definitely worth a watch!"
tt2359704,"Jojo's beautiful art,glourios and extraordinary fights,badass and awesome characters,villains are unique and badass too,the story is great,the memes,music references,the openings,the endings,the poses,the fashion,the music is INSANELY GOOD"
tt2359704,"(Rating as an anime) I don't think I've seen a show quite like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. The show sits currently at 4 seasons (5 parts), and it remains fresh and unique. The animation (while there's some weak points) is for the most part, really good. Most of the fights are extremely interesting. They usually involve outwitting an opponent using their unique ability and the environment rather than pure strength, and it makes this fresh experience that I'm not used to seeing in a show about fighting. Characters are well written and fleshed out, and each have their own unique personality that really brings the show to life. I don't think there was really ever a point that I was bored. However, the first 9 episodes are probably the weakest. Episodes 1-9 (based off of the part titled ""Phantom Blood"") is as generic as the show gets. The characters are forgettable, especially the protagonist, Jonathan, whose main traits can be boiled down to ""I'm a nice guy"". Another criticism that I have with the show is that sometimes characters win battles with stupid conveniences, there are plenty of fights that characters use abilities that they've never used before, and never use again. It always felt like they were included just to give the character an edge in that specific situation. Other than that, I don't really have any other massive criticisms that I want to address. Overall, it's a great show and I'm giving it a 7/10. It's closer to an 8 than a 6."
tt2359704,"Every single episode is the same thing over and over again. A stand user attacks the protagonists, then the protagonists outsmart the villain of the week, and then they move on to the next one. It's literally over a hundred episodes of this happening again and again.If you've seen one episode of Jojo, you've seen them all."
tt2359704,"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."
tt2359704,"Often a lesser gem in the Jojo series, Golden Wind in it's own right can be considered a masterpiece. A story which spans across Italy about a young man named Giorno Giovanna, who sets off on a journey with his friends which can rival Stardust Crusaders. A story about dreams, power, and lineage, follow this installment for a good time."
tt2359704,Jojo is an anime who is extremely underrated and didn't get the attention he deserves. 8.4 is truly a shame for this masterpiece which has inspired so many anime and mangas before
tt2359704,"Peak fiction. There is no bad part of jojos peak adventure, from part 1 all the way to the now part 6 it has been consistently enjoyable and original.10/10 animation.10/10 characters.10/10 plot.10/10 character development."
tt2359704,"I have to hand it to this show: for all of it's plotholes, shallowness, and predictability, it completely makes up for it's flaws and more with it's outstanding art style, over-the-top energy, creative world, and memorable character designs. Almost every character has a special quality that makes them them and has an outstanding design that would make them STAND out in a crowd. None of even the minor characters have a generic design, and it adds to the vibrancy and uniqueness of the world.If you don't mind a fair amount of exaggerated violence, check this show out from Part 1 to the upcoming Part 5 and beyond. Wether you're an anime fan or a simple showgoer, this animated series is too unique to pass by."
tt2359704,"This anime is really difficult to watch after so much time has passed from release, it just feels like an endless supply of episodes that have basically 2 different themes: 1st Jojo and companions travel to a new place and meet an enemy stand user that hands their asses to them, oh no how can they ever survive this attack?? 2nd they overcome the enemy with some witty and ""funny"" way for the 23rd time and keep going, rinse and repeat for 2 entire seasons. you can actually skip a dozen episodes and you wont realize you missed something (you didn't).Animation quality (mostly walking and Jotaros pouting face) is not good, music is repetitive and not special, the story is an excuse for ""funny"" adventures and the humour is repetitive at best, annoying beyond belief at worst.Characters are as interesting as sugar free vanilla ice-cream. Its not all bad, there are some actually pretty decent mini story-arcs if you bother watching it, which is why this is a 6 and not much lower."
tt2359704,"Toxic fanbase aside, its not hard to see how this one series (especially the manga) has redefined and inspired many series that came after it. While some parts are better than others, even my least favorites are still pretty good. And of course I can't wait for the adaption of part 6!"
tt2359704,"A Japanese manga set in Victorian England, where the adopted brother dio tries to steal the inheritance of jo jo. Both brothers have supernatural powers but one is based on good the other evil. Enjoyable monster vampire series but to be honest I enjoyed the early conflict between them more, before they acquired the powers. Having said that episodes which come later in the series are still entertaining."
tt2359704,"Watched 3 seasons because of some comments that says that it gets better. It doesn't. I don't get why it gets so many good reviews, but if you watch, say, half a season and you don't like it, i bet that you never will.What you get with this anime are seasons starring descendants of the Joestar family, where they all happen to be nicknamed ""jojo"" in combination with their names (e.g. Joseph Joestar).The main characters face several minions (1 or 2 foes at a time, who knows why. Anyone would think it's better to send them all together to slaughter the protagonists), and at least one ""boss"", in situations where it often seems that the protagonists are doomed to fail, but in the end they usually come out victorious by various tactics that are sometimes ingenious; others so far-fetched, unclear and/or based on previously undisclosed information that the characters themselves or the voice-over explain what just happened (for some strange reason they also go into this kind of explanations when it happens something obvious that need no explanation at all). The series is a constant repetition of that.The characters are bloated, stereotypical muscular guys with supernatural powers, facing similar enemies, albeit evil ones, of course. The rules that are laid out for how the world of the series works are somewhat vague, at times seeming to be disregarded, and at other times the characters don't seem to realize that there are much easier solutions than the ones they end up taking. Frequently characters are saved by sheer luck, or sometimes because ""the protagonist is so cool he can't lose"" (in the 3rd season the latter becomes downright ridiculous).The result is repetitive, with a story lacking depth, disposable enemies, rather vulgar humor, and overall quite mediocre."
tt2359704,"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is beautiful madness, I'm glad this was recommended to me. Starts off very cruel, great buildup, awesome soundtrack and captivating story. I love the series it's badass even with a couple hours sleep! I'd probably enjoy any spin off and the video game. I've gotten really into this show and love it more than I could've imagined!"
tt2359704,"If you hate seeing the memes, understandable. But if you swear off Jojo's because of it, you are stupid! Jojo's is my favorite anime and manga series because of how well the writing is."
tt4240730,"In the last few years, big thanks to Netflix's wide range of international shows, I have started watching Korean and Chinese TV series and when these shows are good, they are just so brilliant unlike anything I have ever seen. These shows are much better than most of the British dramas, other International TV shows and shows that come out of Hollywood. There is no comparison, in my opinion.Misaeng is no exception. The story of brutal Korean corporate/working culture and its effects on people of different backgrounds is so real/relatable and the acting so natural and unpretentious. The story grips you from the beginning and makes you take on a journey with every character. All the actors were so convincing in their roles especially the actors playing Jang Geu-rae and Oh Sang-shik. Sometimes, I completely forgot I was watching a TV series.Thank you to everyone that made this thought-provoking & at times hilarious and infuriating show possible. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND."
tt4240730,"I'm a huge kdrama fan and I'm a lazy person when it comes to writing. I just couldn't help myself of giving my opinion about such a well-directed kdrama! Unforgettable performances! In love with the characters! How strong, sensible and sensitive they are. My view about the corporative world has just changed forever!
I found out I really didn't know what working for big companies can be.
Well written, well directed, wonderfully played! Get some free time on your schedule and be amazed by this awesome drama!"
tt4240730,"I'm not usually one for Korean TV, and before seeing Misaeng, I never thought I'd enjoy an 'office drama' so much. Featuring structures of the traditional 'bildungsroman', snapshots into the grueling lives of salary-men and office politics, the show intertwines these concepts with humour, emotion, reflectiveness, wisdom, finely executed through a fitting soundtrack, impeccable cinematography and directing and outstanding acting. A solid show thematically, it handles with great sensitivity and deftness the many delicately captured aspects of human nature and society. The characters and their development throughout the story are extremely well written and by far one of the most impressive aspects of the show, fleshed out by the complexity and subtle nuance of the relationships depicted. Entirely believable in both their strengths and vulnerabilities, the show allows an audience to connect with the characters on a very fundamental level. You will find something of yourself, or someone that you know reflected in the characters of the show, the persistent underdog in Gurae who struggles against all odds, the talented but down to earth Young Yi whose exceptional ability as a woman incurs the resentment of her colleagues, the at first seemingly stoic Oh Sang Sik who over the course of the show reveals his deep capacity for empathy and self-sacrifice. Even the 'villains' are never cliché, one-dimensional cardboard cutouts to fill a gap in the story, but all serve towards Misaeng's intimate and moving exploration of the human condition. Misaeng shows many aspects of mundane life, but never itself, becomes mundane, taking the viewer on a at times beautifully poignant, vividly evocative and greatly inspiring journey from start to finish. As I believe this is a show that leaves a viewer of any demographic something to take away, I'd urge anyone reading this to give it a try. For me, Misaeng certainly gave another small unexpected fragment to the missing pieces of my 'incomplete life.'"
tt4240730,"I've had my doubts when checking out the cast - it sure looked like an office romance to me, but man, I was wrong.This is not romance nor is it a mere office soap. It's about people working in an office and the moments they share with each other. You got each office type you'd meet in real life portrayed as realistitc as possible for a drama series. You get to know each person's flaws even and yet you never end up fully hating on anyone. Every person has a believable storyline, motives, motivations.On a sidenote, I'm an offive employee as well. Most of Misaeng is what my life is about - the work, the colleagues, the problems and epically funny moments, the bullying, the psychos, the coffee breaks... Wish I was as ambitious as Jang Gu-Rae, but mostly I enjoyed his naivety when facing problems and his loyalty towards Oh Sang-Shik and his colleagues. My favourite characters would be Oh Sang-Shik, Kang Hae-Joon and Han Seok-Yool. I remember my first job as an intern and that first boss. The only boss so far I've ever actually looked up to (well, before that I'd worked at schools which was a completely different experience anyhow). Oh Sang-Shik reminded me of my boss, the only boss I've ever met that was absolutely loyal and who everyone was loyal to because of that. I've learnt alot from him and will always be grateful. Manager Kang, oh well, not gonna lie, I have a weakness for people like that and I loved his taste in women - I think this is the manager I'd definitely learn the most from. 
While on the other hand, Seok-Yool, that one co-worker you really need in an office, who has more empathy than anyone else, yet sometimes seems like a dork. He's that good soul that'll keep the group together no matter what.I don't really want to go to work tomorrow, it's a heck load of work and people are sick these days, so it's more work for those who aren't on sick leave - but I feel motivated after finishing Misaeng.10/10 would recommend because Misaeng has that spark - that charisma that so many k-dramas are missing."
tt4240730,"This is a beautifully done simple story about an office, teamwork and relationships. After an episode or two, you are fully invested in the character Im Siwan plays and will be cheering him on. While there are no action scenes or fighting or even romance, it will grip your heart and at the end, you are disappointed it is finished."
tt4240730,"I am completely captured by the competence of the writers, director, actors and producers that created this series of highly thought provoking and insightful themes of everyday working culture. Thank you for making me think and review, the complex strategies revealed in the stories and in the acting portrayed. An intelligent and unconventional K-drama that's terrific as it is polorizing."
tt4240730,"I can't keep writing and talking, and writing and talking, and writing and talking about Misaeng over and over again for days. I must say if u have'nt watch this drama, go watch it !! it's a drama that i rarely seen on k-drama world. i can't stop thinking about the motivations behind the characters, about how certain events complicated others, about how to put it all together. It's just well written, well directed and well prepared in details The ending it self it's so..... reasonable. As in life everything happened for a reason, and thats how nicely the story wrapped. After all, Misaeng is Incomplete Life and we are all incomplete lifes trying to become complete, Thats how Misaeng change my opinion about k-drama <3"
tt4240730,"As represented, corporate life in Korea apparently is the worst workplace anyone would have the misfortunate to be a part of. Managers are constantly screaming at their subordinates which makes for tedious viewing. Then there is the sexual harassment that is so blatant as to make you wonder what century you are watching. The abuse of Young-yi by her boss is so hard to watch, as she not only takes it all, but all her wimpy peers stand there and watch and do nothing for much of the series. Based on what is seen, would you want to work in a corporate environment in Korea? No thanks!The lead character is a young man drifting in early life who joins a sales team with only a GED, but approaches his work based on his extensive GO training. OK, we get this. But the character as directed and played by Im Si Wan has to be the dullest character ever to lead a K-Drama. When he imparts wisdom, it is done at a turtle's pace. You could literally go to the kitchen, make a sandwich and when you return to watch, he may have stumbled to get out only 3 words. There are WAY TOO MANY long silent pauses before people speak, and way too many unnecessary flashbacks of things that have just happened in the same or previous episode. The show feels like 25% flashbacks of things we have already seen at least once.Other than watching the constant abuse thrown at the young hires, the only plot points are how Sales Team Three tackles what is presented as impossible tasks, and wind up overcoming obstacles and succeeding. You spend a lot of time as a viewer saying: ""C'mon you guys, stand up for yourselves!"" Lee Sung Min's character steals the show and really holds your interest. His face so much expresses his inner feelings...wonderful! In addition, a big honorable mention goes to Kim Dae Myung who seems to be starting out here, and shows his formidable acting chops very well (check out Hospital Playlist). Otherwise, it's just a showcase for lots of idiot characters to come and go through the 20 episodes. The opening and closing tags in Jordan are ridiculous and do not fit either the main character or the story."
tt4240730,"This show starts out really good if you ignore the 007 preview we get of the future in the beginning minutes, which sort of alludes to the weak ending you're going to get. You'll instantly want to see what happens to the ""newbies"" who enter this company on their road as hopeful future employees.The actors do an amazing job portraying their characters. The most stand out for me is Oh Sang-shik as the office deputy, but really everybody did great. They really made you root and care for the 4 co-workers and the very small number of employees who aren't horrible human beings.Now I don't know how realistic this show is, but damn. Office violence, sexual harassment, backstabbing, horrible bosses, bribes, unjust use of power positions. Why do they even want to work at this place?The obvious answer is money. However this show somehow is trying to glorify some weird worker mentality: Act like a subservient slave and your bosses will warm up to you and treat you better in time. A boss who is not training you at all and treating you like an annoyance, is simply trying to teach you patience and humility. You of course can't ""rat"" out your superiors even if they do shady things, these things will fix themselves.People are treated horribly in this show. Don't worry though because even though your direct superior might practically be a sociopath, the highest boss in the company is a sooper dooper nice guy, and if you remind him that it's ""our company"" which goes from the smallest of the company to the highest, then we'll all have a Disney moment where we'll want to stay longer at work......The nicest boss in the show literally orders the newbies to work themselves to the bone in the weekend (as in they are not getting paid) for something which has nothing to do with their job, and the show treats it like it's some fun get together.There's also some unrealistic and weird storylines added in to create 'chaos', but I guess that's ok. How else are you going to fill 20 episodes of showing things which happen in the office? Like say the reason Young-Yi was mad with her former boss. You'd think he did something horrible from their interactions, I'm not going to spoil it but damn what a useless side story that became.It's an interesting, be it long, watch-through. The last episodes are not nearly as good as the initial episodes. Still a worthwhile watch, it's definitely better than average."
tt4240730,"I really wanted to like this. I'm a relative newbie on K-drama and I loved the first two I watched (Astonishing Attorney Woo and Designated Survivor - 60 days). Unlike so many other reviewers, this one just didn't do it for me.I ought to confess that I had no intention of abandoning it but somewhere during E7 I felt it was going nowhere slowly. So I did something I'd never tried before, and skimmed part of E19 and E20.I accept that is a weird thing to do and some may say I don't really qualify to give a rating, but I wanted to record what the main problems were, in my view.Early on, I liked the way the scene was set for the new intern to find his way in the office. Then the link with baduk also looked good. Even though have never played that game, it was a neat parallel.But then the flaws became apparent. I had a problem with the extreme behaviour in the office. Being unfamiliar with Korean culture I assume this was never intended as realistic. But I found it impossible to suspend disbelief here over such a long series.In particular, I was troubled by the lurching between extreme obsequiousness and equally extreme aggressiveness. As another reviewer commented, perhaps this works better from the perspective of someone used to Korean culture. But I was confused and disconcerted by it all.Another problem was that the work processes never moved from being totally confusing. I suppose that was deliberate, but again it didn't work over so many hours of drama.Many of the hours I watched were very slow indeed. The central character rarely changed his expression and spoke little. I couldn't tell what was really going on in his character and from my brief visits to E19 and 20 it really didn't look as though he, or any of the other main characters had developed.I won't give up on K-drama, but this was disappointing."
tt4240730,"Amazing story, well rounded characters with great character developments, great ending.. great acts..Definitely worth watching and meaningful...Love this drama!"
tt4240730,"I really didn't have any expectations and I thought it would be like the office, comedy or work place romance.
I was totally wrong, I saw this show as learning experience, I think you can use it in any working place. But most importantly thing I like about this show was it reminded me that we all have our problems and stuff and sometimes that gets our way, to achieve our dreams.
I can talk on this for hours haha
I really hope that you give it a chance and thank you Netflix for suggesting it for me 🙏🏾"
tt4240730,"I am from Spain and I have been improving my, once very poor, English to something I can communicate with. I did it mixing the little knowledge I had while living in england for 8 months when I was young. I'm BAD at learning other languages but I tried my best making a big effort to never seeing any movie, TV show or anything related dubbed (in Spain, everything is dubbed.. and that's one of the reasons, if not the main one, our youngsters sucks at English)I started with subtitles in my language... changed for subtitles in English and finally with no subtitles at all (It took many years).And the point is... If people wouldn't cast their votes based on their own experience while watching it (reading subtitles) this TV show would never had such a low grade as 7.5 which many of you may thing is quite good.This TV show deserves much, much more... if You are up to make an effort. Trust me you will never forget this show (and Mr. Oh)"
tt4240730,"The opening sequence, shot in Jordan, suggests we are in for 20 episodes of action. Nothing could be farther from the truth.Office politics in a large Korean corporation. But don't switch this off.As a westerner, much of what goes on is, well, 'foreign' to me. The hierarchy, the Korean sense of what is proper and who is to be respected, how to address your co-workers - most of these are very different in the society I was raised in. And the subtitles need some interpreting. But I couldn't stop watching.It doesn't matter that some of the episodes revolve around arcane corporate issues. What does matter is how the leading characters handle the situations they are thrown into. And the writing doesn't let us off with the facile resolutions we have come to expect. It also avoids the easy 'office romance' - basically there aren't any, and the series is better for it.I have to wonder if there is really so much shouting at work, and as much sexism today, or if alcohol consumption in the Korean business world is as shown here - but maybe this is an accurate portrayal, and livers don't last for long.By the last few episodes I was devastated by what was happening to characters I had come to care deeply about.There's almost a happy ending, which also explains the strange opening sequence in Jordan. But that's not really what this series is about.Try it. Give in to it. And you'll surprise yourself by falling in love with the most unlikely people."
tt4240730,"No romance or high school genres here. Not a lot of violence either. It's a totally believable storyline but dramaticized to hold everyone's interest. Plus it's an open ending which I choose to interpret as a happy ending. So not the usual ""Good God why is this stuff so dark?!"" ending. I keep telling everyone to watch this since it's SO GOOD."
tt4240730,"So its the year 2022 writing this review, stuff going on around the world, yet this piece of art somehow found its way to my tv screen and everything and nothing going on makes sense, neither on or off my screen - just a way of speech, =) - a lot of stuff doesnt make sense to the newbies in this captivating series, clashing with wornout management traditions and ways of doing business. Another timeless korean tv drama piece conveying timeless relations being born, broken and reborn, cut, polished and refined through seemingly mindless and senseless, perhaps sometimes even simply unnecessay conflicts, commenting on the value and essence of human existence - yes heavy stuff like this can indeed play out within the confinements of the stereotyped office cubicle. Sprinkle a great sense of humour throughout the inhumane pressure and toughness and you have a sense of following the stories of real people - not just real actors playing real people. Over the last couple of years Ive come to respect the acting skillls of korean artists and this series is an awesome awesome get together of many many actors Ive seen in many other tv shows by now, be it romcoms, thrillers, familydramas, you name it - it's a great series for a k-tv beginner mind you if the somewhat adult corporate setting appeals to you. If not, check it out anyway and let yourself be surprised by and immersed in an unexpected display of real human sense and emotion, the so-called good and the so-called bad - you just mightt discover a good story always gifts you with something precious to self-reflect upon. Enjoy. Much much appreciated."
tt4240730,"It's a great drama, good story line but very little character development. Very slow at the beginning. Some middle episodes are way too long. Then suddenly in episode 19 and 20 they finish the story abruptly."
tt4240730,"...This review Ignores the first 5 minutes and last 15 minutes of this series...
This series is about life as a newbie in the corporate business world in South Korea. How accurate it is, I have no idea but its riveting stuff.Four newbies (temps.) enter the hostile world of a large trading company and we watch them (3 boys and 1 girl) as they try and progress and become a permanent employee (which takes 2 years). Three of the temps have a good chance of being taken on full time but the fourth has little to no chance as he is only there on a recommendation from the boss's friend.Each newbie is assigned to a different team and with the girl (Ahn Young-Yi played by Kang So-Ra) getting a very sexist group. The main focus is on newbie Jang Geu-Rae (played by Yim Si-Wan) who has no idea of business life placed into a team led by Oh Sang-Shik (played by Lee Sung-Min) who doesn't really want him there.After a few episodes we hear why Oh Sang-Shik doesn't really want him there, his last temp may have committed suicide. As time goes by the manager (Oh) goes out of his way to help Jang Geu-Rae become the best employee he can be.My favourite newbie is Han Seok-Ryul (played by Byun Yo-Han) who is a hands-on, touchy-feelie kind of person whose immediate superior is a nasty, lying, cheating low life person.This may sound like a series you might want to give a miss but don't, its very very good with all the well written stories coming together nicely. Lee Sung-Min who plays manager Oh is exceptional, when he laughs, you laugh, when he cries, you cry, a flawless performance.Does anyone know the connection between the dead girl and Jang Geu-Rae ???...The first 5 minutes and the last 15 minutes are just a happy ending tacked on to make some people happy. It has no real bearing on the show..."
tt4240730,4 interns join a large Korean trading company and find how hard office life is. A poor reflection on the average salaryman as most of the people in charge are misogynistic bullies who are so interested in securing their standing in the company that they have no time for empathy for their fellow workers. Well acted but with little character development it may be better appreciated by Koreans who may recognise some of the daily difficulties of company life as most of their behaviour is alien to me.
tt4240730,I watched this series because the reviews were the best that I have ever seen on imdb but was very disappointed. The whole purpose of the series seemed to be to show that Korean corporate life was a jungle inhabited by a large number of deeply unpleasant people. It may be that corporate life in every country is indeed as nasty as this show suggests and all the glowing reviews were derived from the satisfaction viewers felt on seeing a realistic portrayal. But that is what documentaries are for and I prefer most of my watching to be entertainment. This series had the sketchiest plot imaginable.
tt4240730,"Extraordinary, superlative and such a beautiful show .must watch for all generations and needless to say perfect to a T, leave you with a big smile and positivity and wondering about endless possibilities of life❤❤👍👍"
tt4240730,"People might automatically assume this is some sort of Korean spinoff of the American version of ""The Office""; this could not be further from the truth. It's a fairly unique show that is hard to summarize. The setting is a Korean international trade conglomerate that brings in a new group of interns every year. The interns who demonstrate the most ability are then invited to stay as permanent employees, or as long term contractors. Although it's funny at times, the show dives really deep into the business side of things and does not gloss over the trading industry. For someone interested in business, it's quite enlightening. Beyond that, it's culturally very interesting because it's very specific to how business is conducted in Korea with the very clearly defined etiquette and order that every employee must follow. The interns are on the bottom of the office hierarchy and are abused and treated terribly with impunity by all the more senior staff. They are shouted at, humiliated, and expected to perform to exorbitant lengths. This causes a very strong bond among the interns who share one anothers' plight. The inter-personal relationships are very deep in this show, and very nuanced. Each character has a distinct and well developed personality, and the show mixes all of these people together in compelling and interesting ways, as the main focus. It feels like a very realistic office environment, but the characters keep things interesting without much exaggeration. There is some humor, but it's not a comedy, and it doesn't focus on romance - it focuses on the professional side, but it's never boring. The character development is so strong and well portrayed that it's easy to connect emotionally with the characters and immerse yourself in their world."
tt3526078,"I must admit to really struggling to get into this show in the beginning. After Season 1, I couldn't work out why the reviews were so good, I just wasn't finding it that funny, and wasn't keen on the characters, but I knew I had to keep watching. I think the mistake I made was expecting it to be as laugh out loud as something like Modern Family for example. With Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy who have made me laugh so much with things like Best In Show and a Mighty Wind I was expecting the same thing. But then it just clicked, subtle jokes, characters that become more and more lovable each episode, and really touching moments which have made me shed a tear on more than one occasion. By season five I was feeling sad that there was only going to be one more season after this. This is so well written, and the first time I've seen Dan Levy in anything, and he is just brilliant. If you're thinking of switching off, don't, keep going!"
tt3526078,"I've heard nothing but great things about Schitt's Creek for years but I still put off watching it for some reason. After reading the great reviews and ratings I finally gave in and watched it and so glad that I did because I absolutely loved it. It's just a flat out funny show, nothing really more to say than that. While it's not one of my favorite sitcoms ever it's still really funny and definitely worth watching. It's about a family the had more money than they knew what to do with but then lost it all over night. The only thing they retained was a small hillbilly town and they had to move there and the difference between their previous world and the world they live in now is what makes this so funny. There's a reason this show won so many awards and that's because it's freaking hilarious! Give it a chance and I promise you'll like it, it just might take a few episodes."
tt3526078,"I'm one of the many who, I admit, expected absolutely nothing from a show called Schitt's Creek, so never bothered to even have a look in. Well, I'm here to say I have never been more wrong about a television program!Absolutely love this, and I feel sorry for those who don't get the abundant clever-but-subtle humour that has obviously gone straight over their heads and caused them to leave bitter, whining, negative reviews. Too bad for them, but it's their loss.Schitt's Creek grew on me episode by episode, so much so that I binge-watched the first 4 seasons on Netflix over a weekend! Once in, I couldn't leave! It just gets better and better and I didn't want it to end. I am now watching series 5 and will be awaiting the sadly final series come January 2020 (I hope).I read too many negative reviews from people whining about CBC nepotism and the fact that Dan Levy got a job on this show through his father, so please take note: Dan Levy is the creator of Schitt's Creek, so it could be said he gave his father this job. Together they put this show together, and by bothering to read the credits it's clear that Dan wrote and directed (I think) many of the episodes.On top of that, he plays David brilliantly! His sweetness, fashion obsession, insecurity, need for approval and wit are so cleverly played. People complaining about Dan Levy and his facial expressions: Hello! Those are part of his brilliant performance as David. All the characters express so much with just a glance, an eyebrow twitch or the sardonic curl of a lip -- words aren't even necessary with actors this accomplished! Daniel Levy: you have brought joy to my heart with your writing and portrayal of David Rose!Alexis Rose is annoying, dreadfully so at first. But she learns, she evolves, she grows as time passes. As does David. They are very believable as brother and sister, even sometimes displaying similar mannerisms and expressions. Such clever writing, acting and directing.I have laughed out loud watching Schitt's Creek. I have felt delighted, annoyed, surprised, cringey, charmed and deeply touched. Season 4 episodes Open Mic and The Olive Branch brought tears to my eyes. ""That"" scene in Olive Branch I have rewatched about a dozen times and will watch again and again. (Avoiding spoilers here so not saying more than that.)David Rose. I just want to put my arms around him, give him a big hug, tell him he's beautiful and good and right and that everything will be okay.Love, love, love Schitt's Creek. Love the humour, the satire, the subtle jokes and the big, fat broad ones, and most of all I love the love. It's a beauty!"
tt3526078,"Apparently not for everyone, but I can not get enough of it.
I HATED the ads on Netflix, HATED!, but somehow I finally got around to watching an episode....instantly my new favourite show.Cast is stellar, offbeat quirky humour is my jam. Main cast and side characters fit so well together, people you don't need a laugh track to tell you when something is funny.The shared mannerisms between the Rose family are one of my favourite things about this show, you could almost believe they grew up around each other.
Consistent story line, sweet heartfelt moments, genuinely funny at times, horribly cringey at others.As someone who has never reviewed anything before, (was it hard to tell?), I felt compelled to share my love for this show."
tt3526078,"I have yet to make it through an episode without laughing out loud and I'm already on Season 3 after finding this show two days ago. This is one of the best shows that I have ever stumbled upon. The characters are perfectly cast and each is relatable in their own way. I cannot say enough good things about this show. Plus, Stevie and David are officially my favorite TV duo of all time.Watch this show!!"
tt3526078,"I just now finally got around to watching Schitt's Creek after hearing so many great things about it and I have to agree, it's hilarious. Levy and O'Hara are comedy legends and as brilliant as they are here it's not just them carrying the show like you would think. The entire cast is great, there's usually a weak link or someone who isn't as funny as the others when it comes to these ensemble shows (obviously there are exceptions like Seinfeld, Friends, etc. Where the entire cast is equally great) but not here, every single one of them is great and will make you laugh out loud. Every season is just as funny as the others, there is no drop in quality at all. The episodes are fast paced and so funny that they fly by. Schitt's Creek should be a must watch for any fans of sitcoms because this is one of the great ones."
tt3526078,"I had a hard time getting into it with the first couple episodes, but after learning about the characters it really gets good. I really enjoy it a lot. It's just a fun show to binge!! And Dan Levy (David)makes the show!!!"
tt3526078,"I had skipped over this show several times and have heard people raving about this show. My wife and I started watching this over the New Years weekend and have to say....WOW. This show is amazing! The writing is absolutely brilliant, the casting is perfect and I haven't found an episode yet (halfway through season 4) that I haven't laughed in. The old Riches to Rags storyline works brilliantly because at first, the Rose's are disgusted by everything. Throughout the show, they discover new selves after opening up to the town, it's people and the support of the community only seen in small town life. They all grow from their experiences on the show and they become such a lovable family.The humor in this show is sublime. It is well-timed, sarcastic, dark and hysterical. David Rose (dan Levy) is the character that steals the show for me. His facial expressions, retorts and self awareness makes for an absolute riot of a time!Listen to the reviews on this show and give it a chance...It definitely will not leave you ""Up Schitt's Creek""!!"
tt3526078,"With a title like ""Schitt's Creek"" you'd think that this show would be full of nothing but crass jokes. That couldn't be further from the truth. It's full of heart, and somehow this snobby, annoying rich family grows on you more and more with each episode.
By the end of Season 4 I had tears dripping down my face because of how these characters have found love through immense personal growth. My favs are David and Moira, but even though I found Alexis mostly annoying, I grew to love even her in the end.I'm so glad I had this recommended to me by friends who insisted I watch it, because I never watch these types of sitcoms otherwise.Thank you Dan Levy for coming up with this concept! I listened to him talk about the development of this show through a podcast and I have to say, I hope he writes more shows in the future."
tt3526078,"I don't know why so many negative reviews have been written about this show. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara are classics and it's great to see them back working together. Eugene's son is hilarious and I find their over the top impressions of each of their characters to be spot on. The actress playing the daughter in particular is demonstrating how I see the attitude and behaviour of a lot of the young people today- shallow, vacant and self absorbed. I find this show to be clever yet silly at the same time. Read between the lines and stop expecting this to be like every other tired sitcom out there. I find this show to be very refreshing and I look forward to seeing more episodes. I have never taken the time to do a review before on IMDb but because of the negative comments I felt I had to say something as I hope people will open their minds and give it a chance."
tt3526078,"""Schitt's Creek"" is about love and humanity, told in an absolutely hilarious way. The show gets honest laughs and the characters become like family. It is simply one of the best comedies of all time. It is certainly THE most important comedy to have prominent LGBT characters (sorry ""Will and Grace""). A must see. Creator/star Daniel Levy is a comedic wunderkind. With the show ending with its 6th season, I can't wait to see what he does next."
tt3526078,"A couple of years ago, a friend raved about this series but I didn't pay it any attention. Then I recall seeing glimpses from award season where they won 9 emmys, and I still didn't give it much thought.Cut to a few weeks ago when this showed up on my list of series'. (I'm in Greece and we have a device that has every network, movie, series', television from all over the world in one, it's a bit hard to explain). Anyway, I thought I would give this a go and I was absolutely floored as to HOW good this is! Laugh out loud funny and completely my style of humour. I absolutely adore every character but I especially love the character Moira's amazing dialect, vocabulary, witty expressions etc. So funny!My husband also got hooked onto this and we RARELY watch the same series', so when we put our little one to bed at night after a long day, watching this together is something we so look forward to!We're on season four so far and I know I will be absolutely gutted when we finish the show, I don't think there is anything else remotely funny or brilliant. The last show I felt such enthusiasm for was Catastrophe with Sharon Horgan.Huge respect to the whole cast for the brilliance they pulled off."
tt3526078,"I really can't understand the 10/10 reviews. This series has some amusing moments but never a laugh out loud one. The acting is good but most of the main characters are simply not likeable.
For me it harks back to 1980s American sitcoms with some added swearing and minus (thankfully) a laughter track.
Bubble gum TV that you can have on in the background while you're doing your chores or playing with the apps on your phone."
tt3526078,"A killer cast mixing vets with fresh faces, Schitt's Creek is a great new cable comedy (although it airs on network TV in Canada.) The cinematography and production design remind me of Shameless; the sharp writing and unique characters remind me of Silicon Valley. The slow and steady pace reminds me of the Christopher Guest movies that O'Hara and Levy were in. It's a rich pedigree indeed. And it doesn't disappoint. I was puzzled why so many people didn't like it initially, but I think I get it: with a title like that, some people must have been expecting something juvenile, and laugh-a-minute. Schitt's Creek is much much better than that.The confidence on the part of the filmmakers is evidenced by the lack of a laugh track, and further, the musical score is used sparingly. It can be hilariously funny, but what really hooks me is that it has a heart and a sweetness that other shows might be afraid to show. There are no characters in the show that are unlikeable. It favors character development over easy laughs, and it may take a while for people to catch on to it, but to me this is a sweet slow buzz, and I am addicted.Can't wait for more."
tt3526078,"Like some, the name seemed to ""punny' (as Ted would say) to be good. The first two seasons more or less introduces characters of the show and we are taught and learn their idiocincracies. The plot lines are funny, and we get into the twists and turns of the setting and characters. By season 3 we are ready for story arcs and boy do they deliver! I've watched this series more than once, yet still the last two episodes leaves me an emotional wreck - bawling my eyes out and laughing at the same time! It's no surprise that the last season won so many Emmys and other awards. Highly recommend! Word of warning: you will get addicted to David and Alexis's twitches and gestures....."
tt3526078,"I love this show. I was given the heads up by the UK tv/radio listings magazine Radio Times, of all things. Fortunately, Netflix was gifted to us and we thought we'd give it a try. Well, once my other half and I started watching, we couldn't stop. We've watched 4 seasons in about 3 weeks or so. This should give some idea of how good this show is. The draw was the wonderful Eugene Levy but the other cast members are absolutely perfect, especially Dan Levy and his fabulous character David. I just love the way some of the cast appear to be desperate to giggle at some points, indicating to me they are having a ball. Great writing and performances. Must also mention Catherine O'Hara and the clothes and wigs! I hope Netflix show season 5 soon. Withdrawal symptoms have set in already!
,"
tt3526078,Amazingly good series--LOVE all the actors in it!! but Eugene & Daniel Levy steal the series...with their humor & eyebrows...greatest series I've seen in a LONG while!! THE BEST SERIES ON TV!!
tt3526078,"Schitt's Creek brands itself a sitcom, but it's not funny enough to be great in that department. It's at its best when it gets serious, but those scenes are few and far between. One of my biggest criticisms is that there's not a whole lot of character growth for Moira. She's a very over-the-top, thinly-written character. I loved all the other characters, though. Rarely did this show slay me. It's not funny enough for me to ever stop and watch a rerun in syndication. There's so much range episode to episode. Some are boring, unfunny, and immediately forgettable. But others are really funny and, especially in the later seasons, there is some real beauty to it. Where the show excels is in the characters, not the jokes. The vast majority of my laughs weren't from punchlines, but from the quirky little habits of the actors. The way they use their hands, and their facial expressions, and the way they feed off each other. The best part of the show is its representation of LGBTQ characters, and the normalcy with which it paints them. It's never preachy, or political. It presents queer characters like perfectly normal people, who live and love and form beautiful relationships. It almost exists in a future world, where we're past the issues of today. It's so refreshing to see gay characters given room to grow without persecution and hatred."
tt3526078,"The first season or two I didn't like this show that much. I thought nothing happened in the plot and it wasn't that funny. Season 3 and on I was obsessed with the show and I'm now rewatching. I think ANYONE could watch this show and enjoy it, just give it time. It's so funny and even better on a rewatch. The peak in my opinion is the Cabaret storyline in season five. I'm a huge theatre nerd and seeing theatre really help someone gain confidence made me soooo happy. Additionally, the character Alexis has some of the best character growth I've ever seen on tv. Everyone in the show is phenomenal and there's not an episode that I don't like. Schitts Creek is simply the best!!!"
tt3526078,"I like quirky offbeat comedies and am a bid fan of Arrested Development.Everything felt forced, the comedy felt forced, the 'anger' feels forced, the drama is completely forced and worst of all..the acting is forced. I gave it several episodes and never laughed, smiled or even chuckled once. Being overly bratty, overly annoying, over the top everything does not constitute as funny.If you are the type of personality that laughs at the simplest of things, maybe this show works for you. If you want your laughs earned, you may be disappointed. This is definitely for the Big Bang Theory/Friends comedy crowd."
tt3526078,I was the most sceptical person going into the show but when the season progressed the characters got a great depth despite the quirky setup. The site is suprisingly Emotional that makes the characters much more relatable considering the situation they are in.
tt4295140,"Netflix continues it's quest to fill their service with quality content. And again, they succeed. This time not with a drama series or movie, but a documentary series. All based around the same main theme; the best restaurants in the world and the great minds that created them.The stories of the origins of these restaurants, and especially the chef's who created them, are moving and inspiring. The series successfully puts a human face on these places, which would otherwise be regarded as extravagant and out of reach by most. The passion and drive of the chef's, as well as the struggles they had to undergo to be where they are today, makes you feel glad for their success. Never before have I seen a documentary with such vivid cinematography. The kitchen time-lapses, the environmental shots and the close-ups of the dishes are all phenomenal. Combine this with an excellent classical score, which fits the images perfectly, and you are left with near perfection.This series is a must-see for cooking and food enthusiasts and I cannot recommend it more to anyone who is looking for an inspirational story or simply a quality documentary."
tt4295140,"Is a mere recipe really worth risking 'failure in life' over? Is food really something that can be meaningful and life-affirming?I love the process of creating and serving food and people who devote themselves to making the world a better place one serving at a time. And as I watched the first episode of Netflix's production called Chef's Table featuring Massimo Bottura, I have never felt so utterly moved by a chef's ideas and philosophy about life.I don't care whether Massimo Bottura's restaurant 'Osteria Francescana' has the envious rep of being the world's third best restaurant in the world as much as the man himself and what and how he thinks, because after all, history is littered with the corpses of people who never made it, despite being mindblowingly original and creative and bold and 'I'm gonna go out there and make a dent in the universe' attitude - qualities that I worship.Yes, worship.No, what takes me by the neck and inspires me to raise my own consciousness is Mr. Bottura's passion for life and being original while living it each day. What gives me goosebumps is his way of taking a failure and throwing it back on the wall and turning it into a metaphorical fresco when lesser people would have just slumped down and given up.Steven Soderbergh, while accepting his Oscar for directing 'Erin Brockovich', dedicated his prize to ""anyone who has ever created something - i don't care whether its a book or music or whatever"".I too reserve the greatest respect for anyone who has ever dared to create something that moves this world forward in ANY sense against the forces of disorder and apathy and emotional and physical entropy and brings order and energy back into our lives.I will definitely be watching more of Chef's Table's episodes, and I hope you would too and spread the word. In this mostly sad, pathetic, morose, inert, world we need all the inspiration we can get. I know I do."
tt4295140,"""Chef's Table"", created by David Gelb (of ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi"" fame) might at first glance seem to be yet another show celebrating food but in retrospect its title makes it clear that its main theme is the chefs themselves. It certainly celebrates food in the way that no movie or show about an artist can't help but to celebrate their work (and does so magnificently with some of the sexiest ""food porn"" ever shot) but ""Chef's Table"" is almost entirely about the creators. What makes their creativity tick? Where do they come from? How does their personal past and present influence their work? How do they live? What does their artistic ""voice"" say about what food could and SHOULD be?From an attempt to challenge the ultra-traditional notions of cooking in Italy to trying to find an identity for a still-being-defined Australian cuisine. From the oddly modern and crucial-for-the-future appreciation of the old ways of farming and foraging (which still can't help but be influenced by current advances in technology) to the almost unavoidable requirement of having at least some traditional studies in France or under French chefs (like at least half of the 6 chefs featured so far in this series have). From the importance of rigor and effort to achieve perfection to the importance of experimentation and relaxation to achieve, well... perfection; ""Chef's Table"" shows us the many challenges, contradictions and impulses that these chefs have had to face in order to be recognized amongst the best in the world, but most importantly, to have a voice of their own.While shows like Anthony Bourdain's tell us the wonders of food by means of traveling externally and seeing the infinite possibilities found around the world, ""Chef's Table"" shows us the wonders of traveling inwards, of finding infinite possibilities in one's own memories, origins and desires. The defining elements that tie all of these chefs together is that they all needed cuisine as a way to express themselves and that they've had to carve niches of their own to be able to feel comfortable and satisfied in being themselves, in saying what they WANT to say. Much like when one first knows of the existence of ""film language"" and in doing so begins understanding and appreciating the art form far more than before, ""Chef's Table"" is a series that makes one understand ""food language"" in the best way possible: directly from 6 of its most honestly individual voices, from 6 of its own ""auteurs""."
tt4295140,"I am almost finished watching the first season and I am feeling a little panicked that it will be over soon. I never watch TV because I am simply too busy. That said, I am a food enthusiast (food blogger, home cook, food photographer) and I simply can not resist a well done food show. That said, we booted the cable and I was worried about losing my beloved food TV shows via that network. Chef's Table is far and away superior to any other food related show I have ever seen - including full length movies. I LOVED the photography, the music, the way the stories are told and the voice given to the chefs. I was hoping to discover if another season would be forthcoming by logging on here. Please tell me that it is, because this show is Simply the best. Thank you, Wendi"
tt4295140,"When Netflix began releasing titles I never expected them to turn to the streets for commercial venue. By the streets, I mean, are those which we come by naturally, on our everyday lives. Hotels, restaurants, plazas, touristic organizations represent some examples.As it resonated with my cuisine interests, Chef's Table caught my eye as a way to kill an hour and a half.Never have I experienced such emotional development or communicated elation through watching a food review show. It really becomes something much more than simply a show; instead, a reality one can fully connect with, as the people depicted are not actors, but unmasked human beings."
tt4295140,I normally watch comedy on Netflix but I decided to give this show a try and I fell in love with the stories of these incredibly passionate chefs. The cinematography is breath taking. I feel like I'm watching a nature documentary. The food is beautiful and if it weren't for this show I would never see it because these restaurants are waaaaay outside my price range.
tt4295140,"This is the first review of a show I have ever done. I randomly found the Chefs Table searching through Netfix. This just might become a need instead of a want. Humanity, inspiration, beauty, passion, diversity all served artfully. I feel as if I have found home. As if I have been hydrated after a long summer. I fear that I have tasted and it may be taken away. May it not be a one night stand? Where is the next place, the next one, A film for TV? The food makes my mouth water, the stories cause me grow spiritually, the people challenge my purpose. To be so brave and live as they do. To sit at the chefs table again. I need. My soul thanks you ... bravo."
tt4295140,"I don't even want to describe it (so I don't spoil it). I saw every episode (including the french season) and even rewatched some. I'd rewatch it all many more times.Astonishing shots that softly, tastefully and masterfully serve the purpose of cutting into the body and heart of the artist in the kitchen.In every one of them, every different (very different) chef is analized and is given the chance to speak through words and actions and the soul filling works of art and science and alchemy that we call 'dishes'.This is a show in which each piece does its part in the fashion of a ballet rehearsed till exhaustion.
A documentary where the person behind the camera stretches their open hand and is then greeted with the exquisit fruit of the sweat and tears and blood and fire and brains and faith of the simple person that, day after day, peels potatoes and slices onions and then lets go of their ephimerous creations, entrusting them on the hands of waiters, resting assured that their masterpieces are off to the sea of tables and will burn in the mouths of the people and lie to rest deep within the waves of our unconscious.
One may come to realize chefs are the most political artists to ever step on this little grape we call Earth."
tt4295140,"I am not your typical person who loves to watch documentaries, least of all on food. However, there is something truly unique about Chef's Table. Each episode stands on its own and it is amazing to see the different processes of different chefs. The show does such a great job of showing the true personalities of chefs that the audience is able to make comparisons and differences with each passing episode.All of the chefs that are talked to have many common traits and it is so fascinating to see. All have a certain feverishness for cooking, an amazing work ethic, and have traveled abroad to expand their knowledge in hopes of becoming a food auteur.Their souls are put into each meal that they make for their customers and they view the process of cooking as a beautiful art. Each chef is currently questioning the food landscape around them in hopes of changing the views of people and the way they see food.My only complaint of the show is that it can be a little artsy, but it is amazing and I thoroughly enjoy the show. That is my only warning going in. Please watch the show, it is amazing!!!"
tt4295140,"There should be a show that is done of equal quality about farmers. We are inventive, artistic and equally important. Without the farmers no one would eat and chefs would not have a medium for their art."
tt4295140,"Season 1-4 plus the French episodes are amazing and truly inspirational! One of the best things Netflix have put out.I understand there's only a handful of extraordinary chefs, but there's gotta be some more interesting chefs than those they've included in the last two seasons. At least put more focus on the food rather than dragging it out. I used to turn on chefs table to be inspired, now I turn it on for sleep aid."
tt4295140,"This show started with a bang throughout the first two seasons, maybe even three. Since it's moved along, the once creative gem displaying the results of artistic, emotional cooking from the kitchen and restaurant has gone sour and stale. It is now a ""raw"" attempt at cultural exposure through a biographical narrative and lacking any exposure to the actual creative work performed in the kitchen.We want to know the details of how you developed such complex dishes, where the ingredients are harvested, how you bring them together. Yet all we get now is a short biography and then the name of the dish. Wow! Interesting! It's called ""some supposed inspirational name"". I guess we should deduce that name from the lengthy bio we just watched. We can reduce the show time by 30 minutes, let's just post the menus or names of the dishes."
tt4295140,"My mom and I found this in one of those I-have-no-idea-what-I-want-to- watch-lets-wander-Netflix evenings. We were halfway through the first episode when my husband came in and he was so fascinated he asked if we could start over. The three of us binge watched all of the first season in a couple of days. I love how passionate and creative these chefs are. It makes you really think about your food. Where it comes from, how its grown and raised. It makes you want to cook something as beautiful as these chefs. It also made me go to the web to look up some of the restaurants and chefs to find out where they're located and how expensive it would be to dine in the 3rd best restaurant in the world. We cannot wait for another season!"
tt4295140,"I just finished the first episode of the third season and this docu-series just keeps on getting better. I grapple for words to describe just how much of an impact this is having on me. This is not a cooking show although this is about food. This is all about the artists behind the art of cooking. The motivations, pain, philosophy, culture, and events that spun the wheel of creativity of these geniuses and propelled them to greatness.The show in itself is art. It begins with a fresh outlook, a unique personality changing the landscape of the culinary arts. Then it crescendoes into the journey, the history, and finally an understanding of the beauty of their creations.For me the most beautiful aspect of the show is how it just lets the chefs talk spontaneously and how they open up and reveal themselves in their happiest and most vulnerable. There is always a lesson to be learned from every chef featured on each episode. The philosophy ranges from the out of this world to the simplest and most basic and it will leave you in awe every time the closing credits roll."
tt4295140,"Breathtaking cinematography. Beautiful, moving narratives. The food is almost secondary. It's all about the personal journeys. What I love most about this series is the craftsmanship and care the producers applied in presenting these stories. Absolutely gorgeous."
tt4295140,"The show deserves no more than a 7 but I cannot help but gift an extra point on account of its uniqueness.The food is so well presented, contextualized, and explained. It takes us on a beautiful voyage. These dishes are pinnacles of gastronomic expression, nothing less than a consummate sensory blend of artistry. If you have been at such a table, you know what I mean. It is a painting and a sculpture and a literary journey and... a merging and submerging of taste, smell, texture, temperature, bliss.And there is no small amount of genius than to showcase these culinary gems but on the gritty hands of the workers that mine them. Because, you see, almost without exception (although, there are exceptions), these chefs are conceited and self-important to the point of utter ridiculousness. The contrast is magnificent.One could hope for a better lot of human beings, at least less vain, but the sprinkle of imperfection on perfection, the intimation that while we are so, so flawed, we are nonetheless capable of so much... it is inspiring.There is a real need for more shows like this one."
tt4295140,"I am just loving this. I always had a different perspective about those having top restaurants in the world. They do live in luxury and just enjoy opening their new branches around but my image was totally ridiculous after seeing this documentary it is not only about culinary journey it is about how determination and hard work produces sth extraordinary. Creation, invention and doing sth completely denovo every time a high degree of pressure and stress as well. I only was hoping to see also a very very short instruction of one of those remarkably astonishing foods at the end but anyway this is absolutely recommended to watch to all ages. I was crying my eyes out how we never realized we could look at messed up things in another way."
tt4295140,"I'm not a foodie, not a chef, and although I like cooking, I""m not in interested in cooking shows.I started to watch the series as someone told me the images of the show were brilliant, 4k HDR and I was checking out how it would look on my new 4k HDR TV..... expecting to watch 5-10 minutes and that's it.... oh boy... was I in for a treat!Seriously .... amazingly creative people, talented / extremely hard working, absolutely focused, to an extreme.... most if not all have a single passion for creativity, freedom, pursuit of excellent.... whatever drives them is completely unique to each Chef... and vastly different from one another.... The way its filmed, the music, the angles, the perspectives of what drives them and the sacrifices they had to make to get there, some selfishly others in pursuit only of their craft and nothing else... extremely interesting, touching, moving... Every single episode I find myself in awe by the amazing creations, hoping one they I would have the chance (and the money) to experience and savor one of the restaurants/chefs. But above all, I'm moved but why its filmed, the aspect, the human in the story, the journey it takes us the viewer to discover the Chef, its life, what drives them, the people around them to support and give them the structure they need to achieve their vision....If you go in expecting great images, like I did, you will certainly find the best of what is available right now in 4K HDR streaming.... but, hopefully, you will stick around, and discover so much more.... Amazing show.... give it a go...."
tt4295140,"Inspirational stories applicable to any walk of life about having a vision / a dream and having the conviction and faith to pursue it, no matter the cost...most episodes bring me to tears and leave me feeling enthralled - truly exceptional and utterly compelling!"
tt4295140,"Have you ever wished for a film where the entire set; from the subject, producers, directors, cinematographers, and editors seem to be in sync and playing at their A-game? Well, this docuseries delivers that without drifting away from the story in a very captivating & inspirational way.All the chefs featured therein take you through their journey to their current level of finesse at their craft and it truly speaks to the idea of what it really takes to become a titan in whatever field/domain/game your playing."
tt4295140,"I absolutely love this show! The fact that they show behind the scenes, childhood tales and the struggles of these top chefs is just an amazing perspective - and makes them more human and approachable. Love this show!"
tt4295140,"This show does romanticize and aggrandize talented chefs and the food they make. That's the premise, if you don't like it, you won't enjoy the show. If you don't like science fiction, you won't enjoy Star Trek, if you hate organized crime movies, you'll never appreciate The Godfather. Same here.The show beautifies the work and one might say genius of great chefs, it has very artistic cinematography and editing, moody classical scoring, and even pretentious captioning. It's great if you're a long time fan of food TV or probably just food in general.Sadly the show really declined over the last couple seasons, as it seems the producers have gotten tired of the food. I know they got some pushback to feature more diverse chefs after the first season, which they did, but they've pushed it further with some episodes featuring a supposedly talented chef that barely touch on their food or their talent.One chef was an illegal immigrant, they did quite a biography on her time growing up in Mexico, stretched it thin as humanly possible to cover as much running time as they could, and then when they were done, that was it, her food didn't much matter. Another chef owned a successful Indian restaurant in England, they discussed how she decided she wanted to cook her whole life and how eventually she did, and then that was the end of the episode her food or talent was nowhere to be found.This was supposed to be ""Chef's Table"" about chefs and their food. If you want to make a show about the life struggles of various diverse women, then you are free to make that show, and maybe I'll watch it, but that isn't what they've chosen to do. They're supposed to make a show about chefs, but their culinary talent is beginning to be an afterthought that may barely even make it on the screen for a few seconds. How much do you respect them as a chef if you aren't willing to see them and appreciate them as a chef? Is that really respectful to them or their talents? Or did the producers select them with no consideration or belief in their abilities, but merely because they thought they'd make a good, politically appropriate story?The last season featured a chef who owns a restaurant in Georgia, who was a black woman. The makers were so fascinated by this situation, by the opportunity to talk about race and racism, that they never got to her food beyond the widest of descriptors. Her training and backstory was worth telling, but the main gist of it is she's a hard worker, she studied in France, she studied under another talented chef upon returning to New York, and then you can get on to her work now, but they didn't. They took forever going through that backstory, intercutting it with their ""social"" dialogue. They feature a food critic praising her food and creativity in two five second segments, good to know! Apparently that stuff isn't worth focusing on and discussing though. Heaven forbid a viewer interested in food and the thinking of chefs want to find out about her food and how she thinks. It's just a real disappointment so often in the last two seasons."
tt4295140,"The talent of these chefs and the material is undeniable. The show however takes an uncritical view of everything and everyone, choosing instead making an hour long paean to make viewers feel inspired and thankful to be on the same planet as these people plating meals you wouldn't want to pay for out of your own pocket. To quote Wayne and Garth, ""We're not worthy.""The shift has gone from the food to the personas, and to its own overwrought production. I almost feel like the filmmakers want someone to make as loving and doting a show about them as they are with these chefs. Unfortunately they are not nearly as creative, but rather formulaic. The show seems to lack heart and humor, opting for self congratulatory and hearty handshakes, and the kind of faux intellectualism rightly looked down upon. The chefs and their work are already brilliant, they don't need any propping up.An hour-long format is way too much for many of these episodes, perhaps if less than all of it was shown in slow motion, it could be condensed into half an hour."
tt4295140,"This documentary series opened my eyes and world to food and cooking. Each episode was inspiring not only from the stories of the chefs but from the food they cooked. I think the cinematography, editing and music really uplifted what a documentary about food could be and set new standards in the film industry to continue. Thank you to the directors and everyone who made this series the way it is. Great work!"
tt4179452,"This series is one of the best ever. As one of the characters said, ""It is life."" So much happens.... characters live and die, sometimes unexpectedly and certainly not what you wanted to happen. Despite being set in the 9th century, the series makes it clear that politics and power have not changed and The Last Kingdom amply demonstrates this. The role of religion and the power of the church also are treated as they should be.... sometimes good and sometimes evil, just as humans are. Watch it. I can hardly wait for season 4."
tt4179452,"With the plethora of mediocre historical series out there, I did not expect much from this show. I, however, was utterly blown away by how compelling it is, and by the excellent acting by all. The subject matter is fascinating, and it depicts well the harshness of living, and surviving, in a barbarous world, with an emerging, equally barbarous ""new"" religion. The casting was terrific. The actor who played Scorpa, the Dane of the White Horse, was beyond fierce. An unforgettable presence. I was especially, impressed by the lead, Alexander Dreymon, whom I had never seen before. As the series progresses, you really see this guy's acting chops. His range is from the tender to the ferocious. He has a bunch of us hooked, and we cannot wait for the next season. Thank you for entertaining us!"
tt4179452,"This a world class tv series with a brilliant cast. Thank you Netflix for Season 3, it's simply outstanding!"
tt4179452,"I stumbled across this hidden gem and binged-watched it in just a few days. I cannot express how much I enjoy the story, the actors - the sense of realism. There's nothing like it on television! Wished that Netflix would promote it more. Some compare it to Vikings, Game of Thrones, and Witcher, but once I got a taste of The Last Kingdom, I couldn't even watch those others because TLK makes them look comically over-produced. So if you're looking for a realistic historic drama with great acting, this one's for you!"
tt4179452,"I reviewed this after the first season in 2015. I'm doing it again after season 4 in 2020. I said this show had the potential to be better than GoT and Vikings.
In my opinion it has done that. You think GoT had unpredictable deaths? Well buckle up for this show. It happens a lot and at times it's completely out of nowhere and not a spectacle at all. You're like you know I like that character. Boom. Well sh&t they're dead! The story is absolutely fantastic. The characters are likeable and some are downright unforgettable. How this show doesn't even get any buzz around award time boggles my mind. The performance of Alfred in season 3 should have been Emmy and Golden Globe nominated. The show in general should be.
This show has turned me into a fanboy and not many shows or movies have ever done that to me. Breaking Bad, The Witcher books and now this. So take this review as the words of someone who loves this show. If you watch all four seasons I think you will feel that this is one of the best shows currently running.
I've been wrong before, but if you like swords, shields, battles, violence, betrayal, revenge, moments that make you want to jump off your couch run through a wall and high five the first person you see then WATCH THIS SHOW!"
tt4179452,"Without going into too much detail, this show will slowly but surely get you attached to the main character Uhtred son of Uhtred. The immersion that this show provides leaves you stunned at times and it never fails to disappoint in terms of character development. It shows how a man who carries himself with honor and conviction doesn't always get what's due never the less that doesn't hinder him in pursuing his dreams and his birthright."
tt4179452,"Have watched Game of Thrones, Vikings, Peaky Blinders- etc etc..but I had never even heard of until a few weeks ago has blown me away. The characters are well developed and you feel like you get to know each of them. Uhtred is by far the most interesting character that you he root for every episode. It makes me sad that with all the garbage out there, that the series doesn't receive the attention and accolades that it should. It's an excellent show, excellent production value, excellent storylines. Each season gets more intense and storylines are seen through. I highly recommend it."
tt4179452,"Just happened to find this show scrolling through Netflix one day. So happy I found this series.The first episode was good, but it took 2-3 to draw me in. I think the plot and story are just great. It is a twist on the Viking world that is currently taking TV by storm. The actors do a phenomenal job with their characters and interaction with one another. I love how the relationships have developed between all of the characters in this world, between Uhtred/Alfred/Ragnar and just the many many other characters how have strained and strengthened relationship. I have turned several friends onto this who are GoT fans. I think this series is right there with GoT.I can't wait for another year of it and I am interested in where they take the story and the characters!"
tt4179452,"The Last Kingdom is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best shows I've ever seen! I'm a big fan of this genre show I was excited to start watching it and once I did it quickly became one of my favorite shows of all-time. It has enough violence and drama to satisfy anyone watching it. It gets compared to Vikings and Game of Thrones a lot and as good as those shows are this holds up against either of those . It's one of the rare shows where every episode of every season is fantastic. If you're looking for a great show that will keep you entertained throughout the entire series then give this a try. You won't be disappointed!"
tt4179452,"Binge watched 3 seasons of TLK.Tbh,i thought that this show will be good.But after some posts in the group, i tried the pilot episode and from there i have binge watched all 3 seasons in just 3 days.I kinda like and prefer more realistic films/series and that's the reason why i haven't gave TLK a try.But, it is so realistic and I regret it now.It was the best series i have watched in the recent times.It was fast paced and gripping from the pilot itself.I haven't felt a single low movement in the whole 3 seasons.Mainly, the strong characterization and the guy who played Uthred(Alexander) is just perfect for his role.I like his voice very much.Every single time he says""DESTINY IS ALL"", i get goosebumps.And,the whole cast are good.I loved the relationship between Uthred and Alfred and the way they presented it. Cinematography and editing can't be better.Season 3 was much better technically when compared to 1 and 2.Special mention to the Soundtracks of the series.Ahhh! They are so addictive.Still can't get over with those characters and the kingdoms (:"
tt4179452,"For a medieval adventure, The Last Kingdom moves at a strikingly fast pace with unhinged ferocity and undiplomatic cultural clash. Audience might be familiar with The Vikings and it does have similar characters. Both series sets in the same timeline and world, but this one is told from the perspective of an England boy. This is a fresh rendition of epic saga that creates solid characters in highly perilous time, relying less on stylish ambiance and more on gritty dusty violence.Uhtred, son of Uhtred, is a boy meant to inherit an earldom. Then a series of unfortunate events carries him from luxurious to eventual warrior life. All of which happen in far greater pace than most television series. It introduces characters and sends them off to whatever fate tomorrow may hold for them, it has no place and time for wallowing.Admittedly, this grants a much cinematic presentation, it also keeps the plot and characters very well refined. Script presents just the right amount of bantering for the personalities to be identifiable, establishing the relationship without wasting a moment. As its peers have done, it also brings skirmishes and brutality. Action is straightforward mayhem, grounded in presentably realistic warfare of the time. There's no shortage of carnage or blood here.However, it might encounter a few issues later on. The transition could feel too brief, audience barely has enough time to invest before it shifts the plot pretty significantly. While it doesn't gloss over details, some subplots could've been more thorough. There are plenty of characters passing by even in span of one episode, that it simply has no time to cover them all and this rapid pace might not match runtime of a series.The Last Kingdom is an intriguing epic tale. Granted, comparison could be made with Game of Thrones or The Vikings, be it a blessing or a curse, but it's strong enough to stand on its own and definitely a worthy foray to another medieval realm."
tt4179452,"I love every episode of this show, there is always an action, it does not bore even for a minute. This show is the reason why I am still paying for Netflix, it reflects the era very well. I hope they do not cancel and continue for years."
tt4179452,"I will not summarize the plot of THE LAST KINGDOM, as it follows a familiar quest-pattern and has been amply described by previous reviewers. Suffice to say that the source-text's author is Bernard Cornwell, an established writer of historical adventures set in various historical periods that have translated successfully to television in the past (remember SHARPE (1993-2008))?Directed by four different people (Anthony Byrne, Ben Chanan, Peter Hoar and Nick Murphy), THE LAST KINGDOM is basically SHARPE transposed to the Saxon/ Viking era, with the same combination of familial politics, intrigue and rivalry. The moral priorities are determined from the first episode onwards: the Sharpe-character is personified by Uhtred of Babbanberg (Alexander Dreymon) who must negotiate several obstacles before he can assume his rightful place in the formation of a new kingdom. Good guys and bad guys are easily distinguished, chiefly by their hirsuteness; the bad guys have bushier beards and longer hair than their rivals.Each episode has its fair share of incident, romance, and a touch of pathos; the visual style owes a lot to Ridley Scott's KINGDOM OF HEAVEN (2005), with its lengthy pans of lonely isolated, almost primeval landscapes contrasted with dimly-lit interiors illuminated by candlelight. Considerable emphasis has been placed on the elements - sunrises, sunsets, storms, wind and rain - making us aware of how difficult life can be for those trying to establish social and political order. Hence their acts of heroism become all the more noteworthy.THE LAST KINGDOM might be hokum, but it is nonetheless highly entertaining: we care for the characters and their futures, even if we are well aware of what will happen in the end. As with most adventure novels, there is little doubt that it will have a morally definite ending."
tt4179452,Again rewriting history and doing social engineering with black people un S05. We already know your plans but please leave The Kingdom Alone alone. It was the last series you hadn't destroyed.
tt4179452,"In a way, BBC's The Last Kingdom is a first ever experience for me. It's certainly not the first series I watch, nor it's the first series based on books, not even historical fiction books. But it's the first series which I'd read the books it is based on way before it was even announced. So seeing it rumored, then officially announced and finally premiered was very interesting and exciting. I had a lot of hopes and fears for this. And I'm so gladly to say that based on the first two episodes of the series, my hopes were made into reality and my fears into joy. And so, inspired me to write my first review here.I'll try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but some are impossible to avoid.The Last Kingdom tells the history of Uhtred of Bebbanburg, a Saxon noble who is captured and raised by the Danes, first as a slave and then as a son. His future will be one of battle within and without, fighting against powerful warlords and struggling between his love for the Danes and their culture and his duty for the Saxons.In many ways, talking about how this series make this simple enough premise into a engrossing story full of nuance is talking about how the books do it. Here there is a commitment to reality that goes beyond most historical shows, and I'm not talking only about the clothes, weapons or history itself, but characters, their motives and relationships. At the center of The Last Kingdom is its characters and the show presents and develops then masterfully. Take Ælfric (Joseph Millson) for example, Uhtred's uncle. When the young Uhtred (Tom Taylor) wakes up and realize his father went to war without him, he promptly go and ask him why he was left behind. His uncle barely talks to him and say he has to go and clear the stables. But the directing and acting in the scene makes it clear Ælfric has something sinister in mind. Uhtred get his pony and goes to join his father, and then you realize that that was Ælfric's plan all along. It's subtle and skillfully done, and with something that feel effortless you have a lot shown to you what Ælfric is all about. When it comes to characters there is no compromise, they feel like real people that are just living their lives. Doing what they think is right and/or what is best for them and their loved ones. You won't find good or bad here, nor one dimensional characters. By the end of the first episode, you will find you will have feeling for these people, both positive and negative. And in the end, that is what keeps you interesting in a series. And you will care for the fate of Uhtred (Alexander Dreymon), Brida (Emily Cox), Alfred (David Dawson) and the many other great characters that are present in the first two episodes.And from them stem all the other conflicts in the series. The political plotting and machinations are ever present in the fractured world that these people inhabit, and the leaders of both the Saxons and Danes are constantly trying to get things working in their favor. Together with political issues, there is religion. Christianity is a defining characteristic of the English, and because of the Norse paganism, they view the Danes not only as enemy of the Saxons, by enemies of God. The Danes of the other hand, view Christianity with a disinterested curiosity. In one opportunity Uhtred explain Heaven as Valhalla without all the drinking, fighting and humping. This passage helps to illustrate a kind of 'lightness' that the series, just as the books, have. Maybe lightness is not the best word, since there is plenty of violence and moments that will leave you shocked, but the story is told in a way that feels amiable and pleasant. That is done is the series by skillful directing , writing (in the first two episodes done by Nick Murphy and Stephen Butchard respectively) and editing. That, along with its character, might be the two most appealing things about The Last Kingdom.Add to that a great score, beautiful scenery and great acting (although a little bit inconsistent in some moments) and you have the recipes for a series that stand tall and deserves to be seen. No matter what you like, The Last Kingdom (the first two episodes together are a nice demonstration of everything good about this story) might offer something for you.For the books fan in particular, this is a series that even when it changes the story of the book it feels it belong, Bernard Cornwell's tone is ever present in it. Not to mention many small moments that shows the people responsible for the series really cared about the source material, like in shield wall battle (it doesn't reach the greatness of the book, but then, what battle scene anywhere does?), there is a scene of people walking over a dead body, something that feels taken right from the book. Or a sword strike that comes from bellow. Even some of the more questionable changes feel justified. Like giving the Saxon rectangular shields. In the end it proves extremely valuable as a tool to differentiate Danes from Saxons. But without a doubt, this is a adaptation that work is all levels and will delight most readers."
tt4179452,The best way to describe The Last Kingdom is that it is just a flat out awesome show and a must watch! I never read the books so I didn't really know what to expect but I'm so glad that I did start watching it because it's become one of my favorite shows of all-time! I can not overstate just how good this show really is. It's one of the rare shows where every season is just as good as the others. There really isn't much more I can say about this incredible show that hasn't already been said so just go watch it!
tt4179452,"Once you start, you won't want to stop.Really hoping for a season 4."
tt4179452,"(Flash Review)This series is not known as well as it should be. It blazes its own trail without being pressured to follow the path of Games of Thrones. The characters are still full of depth, emotion and moral quandaries. Season 4 watches a young and inexperienced King of Wessux, which seems to be the head kingdom of the four primary kingdoms, struggle to make decisions, earn respect and maintain true allies. There's an abundance of intertwined story lines and with moderate viewer focus can be clearly followed that are all rich with drama. As with most Mid-Evil shows, many a battle is fought, much flesh is slashed or punctured and blood spilt. Great production value, unique musical score and honest acting make this a must see if you like Mid-Evil era shows."
tt4179452,"Less polished than GOT, yet thoroughly riveting and entertaining. Just goes to show that showmakers don't need to spend tens of millions per episode to put on a great show. This show has some great actors and an obviously brilliant director"
tt4179452,If you haven't starting watching this yet and you're are thinking about it - think no more and just watch it. You won't be sorry. This series is sensational with brilliant writing and phenomenal acting. There is so much going on but it is easy to follow the storyline and it keeps you interested and excited and anxious for more. When season 2 ended it was tough. I am now started to watch season 3 and so far I am not disappointed. Thank you Netflix for another amazing series. I am rooting for a season 4 and more please.
tt4179452,"It's always been a bit far-fetched and borderline silly but The Last Kingdom was always very watchable and compelling. That is until the latest series (four), which is absolute dross. Did they sack the real scriptwriters and just let the actors improvise??If this is the best the can do I hope they don't try to eke it out any longer. For their sakes."
tt4179452,"This is legit my favorite series available right now, and one of the best I think has been made in a very long time. It's a fascinating historical period, and the show developers, writers, actors, costumers, set designers, etc have all brought their A game for sure. The story lines are captivating and the pacing is just right. The acting is top notch👌. It's just all around awesome! I hope they will continue the show for many more seasons! Long live UHTRED!!!"
tt4179452,"Ok, I'll start by saying the show is quite entertaining and that the script is quite well written. It's a show you can't miss a moment of or you'll be lost , as there is always something happening.With that said I'll admit I understand the times the show takes place in quite well; but, I find Uthred actually a rather unlikable and seemingly predictable character. His personality is actually rather offputting and I'm not sure if this is Dreymons true accent; but it seems rather forced in parts and even jarring; though not in a fun way. Also, Dreymon is a good actor ; but he doesn't quite seem to fill the role of Uthred at all, and would have been better suited to be in films like Kingsmen or The Gentlemen- not as a blood thirsty half Dane / Saxon warrior.There isn't really a character on the show that differs from others. The Danes are all pretty cookie cutter, with even Brida being a good deal of the time a bit too much and again seeming overacted.I love a nice complicated storyline and found that the names also being very close in sounds (Uthred, Guthred) made it at times a bit silly trying to figure out whom was being spoken of.The show seems to have a repetitiveness to it in knowing that Uthred will always come out alive and ok somehow and that there will be one big battle in the last episode of each season. Also, the soundtrack was ok the first episode or two but hearing the same three songs repeated EVERY EPISODE made it feel lazily put together.Overall it's worth a watch and at times quite entertaining - especially those battle scenes , very well done. But it certainly isn't a masterpiece. Some more character range , and better casting and soundtrack would VASTLY improve this series."
tt4179452,"Woke killed the show, not even the 10/10 bots can save it. I don't think that it's a result of incompetence, you simply can't have nice things any more."
tt4179452,"This is the best series I have ever watched! It has an an amazing cast. All the characters bring their own A+ skills to this series! I am obsessed with this show! I love love the character ""Uhtred""! Not to mention the actor who plays him- Alexander Dreymon! HE is sexy/gorgeous! I have rewatched this series about 6 times now! I just cannot get over how good it is! I dont want it to end!"
tt5189670,"I've been binge watching this and I'm halfway thru season 2 and all I can say is I'm thoroughly disgusted with the cops, prosecutors, judges, jurors all of them. All one needs to do is watch the very 1st time Brendan's so-called confession tape was aired in the series! That CHILD had NO CLUE what the interrogators were talking about nor what they wanted him to say. This boy was, no IS so innocent, that when they started their LEADING questions regarding ""what happened around her head area""...after a long bout of silence he responds quote: ""I CUT HER HAIR?"". That is how innocent and non-violent Brendan is. That the first thing he could think of ON HIS OWN was a freaking HAIRCUT!!! Those interrogators were SO frustrated by his obvious lack of knowledge of what happened to the poor woman that they announced for all of us to see THAT THEY TOLD HIM she was shot in the head. Haircut to a Bullet in the Brain. Despicable. Wisconsin is full of corrupt cops, prosecutors, state attorneys, forensic analysts, and judges...in at least TWO COUNTIES. SHAME ON YOU!"
tt5189670,"This documentary is insane! The best true crime documentary out there. It purely sheds light on the TRUTH of this nightmare of a case. Its infuriating to say the least. The American criminal justice system is SO corrupt, twisted, and flat out wrong for convicting Steven and Brenden to life for a crime they did not commit. EVERYONE needs to watch this documentary and be angry at how they were 100% framed.unbelievable."
tt5189670,After watching this I will never set foot in the State of Wisconsin. What was done to this man was a fate worse than death. I am normally a supporter of the police but not in WI.
tt5189670,You need to watch this to see what are the autorities capable to do to protect them self
tt5189670,"This is one of the best documentaries ever created and a must-watch for everybody. 
The story is so insane and unbelievable that you would think this is a piece of fictional work, but it is not.The only thing that could have been made a bit better is the episode running-time, sometimes the episodes feel a bit too long.
--9 out of 10 stars--"
tt5189670,"It's hard to put into words how moving this documentary series was. The view of this work from 30,000 feet is perhaps that it is a beautiful but tragic depiction of the powerful versus the powerless in the context of the American criminal justice system, and a haunting reminder of what human beings are capable of when we believe the ends justify the means. The view on the ground - from a very intimate front row seat in Steven Avery's hometown of Manitowoc, WI - is that one man likely endured not one, but two of the most egregious injustices imaginable. One thing that sets this series apart from previous shows in this genre (like NPR's Serial) is that the producers never once make an appearance on camera, nor does the viewer ever hear their voices, at least not in a literal sense. Instead, they rely on interviews, court proceedings, news clips, and telephone and video recordings to tell the story, often against the backdrop of the Avery's family compound. In a simple and clean way, the series is beautifully shot. And the story itself... unbelievable. But even the most reasonable, even skeptical viewer will have to grapple with the theories put forward. Theories that would seem a reach at best if it weren't for the overwhelming hard evidence unfolding, on film, right before your eyes. I started out by saying that it was hard to describe how moving this documentary was, and I actually found myself transitioning through the same emotional states (albeit to a much lesser degree) that the key figures seemed to experience: from shock and disbelief to anger and ultimately to a sense of despair. To me, what separates television and film that constitutes true ""art"" from that which is merely entertaining, is that it reveals something perhaps not so obvious but nonetheless true about human nature or the human experience. This easily surpasses that standard, but what makes it particularly chilling is that this is not a carefully constructed fictional plot designed to pull our heart strings. This actually happened. And it happened to real a person. To a real family."
tt5189670,"I should have been in bed 5 hours ago but I can't stop watching the new chapter of the Avery Saga. The miscarriage of justice is frighteningly insurmountable. Being a screenwriter, if this were a movie I was going to write, I would never have been able to use this plot. I wouldn't have believed an audience would accept such a series of ludacris events like the mishandling and planting of evidence, unethical prosecutorial actions and the total and complete lack of ability to self examine their actions, due to fear. Fear because they've fully committed to their guilty story and if found innocent, how bad they'll look."
tt5189670,"This documentary is incredible. It may seem a bit one sided but if you look at the list of people at the end who declined to be interviewed you will see why. You can't begrudge the producers for the other side not cooperating. That being said, the outcome is not very surprising. If you've paid any attention to America's justice system ..... ever ....you would understand that cops and judges are above the law and they can do whatever they want and they have zero accountability. This series just solidified that. Everyone is going to act angry and appalled but then never actually do anything about it. And it will continue and the ""good ol' boys"" will continue trampling on our basic ""freedoms and liberties."" Yay USA!! *insert exaggerated eye roll here*"
tt5189670,"....don't mess with Avery's new lawyer. Her relentless and intelligent approach leaves no stone unturned and has brought much astounding new evidence to light.I was impressed by the 2 original lawyers in Part 1, but they come across feeble and impenetrable compared to her.Exploding to see the corruption finally get unfolded- this show has clearly taken the world by storm, and I pray justice and the truth will be brought to light."
tt5189670,"After watching this film I felt Avery was guilty as charged. This was before I did reading on all the damaging evidence mentioned in passing if at all by the filmmakers. It felt more like an extremely long episode of DatelineNBC instead of the first Paradise Lost film on the West Memphis Three. Unlike the Thin Blue Line, Making A Murderer doesn't show us there was very little evidence in Avery's case that would have exonerated him. DNA of his inside both her car and on the hood. The *69 calls to the victim to hide his number on the day of the murder. A key found several days after the initial searches of his residence. Evidence missed is not unusual, several key pieces that tied Manson's family to the Tate murders were found on subsequent searches. Lack of fingerprints? Profiler John Douglas wrote it's Mike rarer than one thinks to find identifying fingerprints at crime scenes; this while he was still with the FBI. After finishing this series I did some investigation and found even more evidence than covered in the film. On the other hand, I do believe there is a good chance his mentally slow cousin was fed his false confession.If you like true crime I think you will really enjoy this for the entertainment value. It's not as depressing as My Brother's Keeper. For entertainment value- 9 stars For being so biased on the ""railroading"" of Avery I give it 4 stars. I rated my average down as by the eighth show I was beginning to lose interest."
tt5189670,"Steven Avery has a past history of severe domestic violence toward his first wife, Lori, and his former girlfriend, Jodi. Also, years ago, there were allegations of sexual abuse towards more than one minor relative of Steven. Unfortunately, I didn't research this until after I watched the series. The show's producer/writer couple are deluding themselves if they think he is simply a kind gentleman who was wrongly convicted. The show is compelling, but not real. Just do some homework if you watch this series so you're not in the dark. Of course, there are real problems with our judicial system, the producers were not honest about this case."
tt5189670,"This was one of the most heartbreaking, inhumane and irrational criminal cases I came across in my entire life.You will find two major types of reviews in here:1. The skeptic type, based on rational and logical analysis of all the evidence and framings towards Steven Avery and Brenden Dassen making them not guilty (attributing around 10/10 rating).2. The emotional type, based on irrational and illogical analysis of all the speeches and horror stories the prosecution, the police and the media told the public making them guilty (attributing around 01/10 rating). This documentary series is constructed to favour the skeptic type (1). However, reality favoured the emotional type (2).Living the American nightmare, shall them say.Enjoy this highly unbiased masterpiece."
tt5189670,"Making a Murderer documents the true story of Steven Avery, sent to prison under questionable circumstances, exonerated on DNA evidence 18 years later, and accused of murder shortly thereafter under equally questionable circumstances.MaM, ten hours long, is gripping throughout. The story is revealed chronologically, paced so perfectly to leave the viewer gasping at regular intervals, yet never feeling manipulated. But make no mistake: the filmmakers do have an opinion. And by the end of MaM, it is an opinion you will share.The comparisons to gems like Paradise Lost and The Jinx are inevitable. Up until now, Paradise Lost represented the pinnacle of the genre; MaM tells its story similarly, yet surpasses PL. Where The Jinx, an otherwise excellent documentary, left me with a bad taste, feeling that the truth played second fiddle to its filmmakers' ambitions, MaM never focuses on its creators. The drama is narrated only by the players, the argument made convincingly by historical footage, media and police manipulation made plain not by rhetoric, but by the simple evidence provided by context.Avery's story, as presented in MaM, is a horrifying story that leaves one infuriated at law enforcement, politicians, and news media. Not generally one for righteous indignation, this was the first series I've ever watched from which I had to take regular breaks out of sheer rage. Avery's story is not a pleasant or uplifting one. But it is as well-told as any I've seen."
tt5189670,"This is an incredible documentary. There is no doubt that Steven Avery was framed by the police in order to prevent the $36M law suit. I wonder how long this will go on until the State of Wisconsin admits to the unbelievable injustice of Avery and the corruption of its officers. This also proves how much power lies in the State and how they really can do whatever they want, and how they control all authorities across it's jurisdiction."
tt5189670,"This is one important documentary. This shows just how wrong the justice system is in America. Im from Sweden and did not know anything prior to this series. But If you have - like me, been reading and seeing other documentaries of this kind. You know this have happened several times. It makes me sick. When it comes to Brendan and his statement I immediately started to think about Jessie Misskelley. A boy with below average IQ and was one of three teenagers that got falsely accused of murdering three young boys in Memphis. He also made a ""confession"" after the cops had lured and guiding him towards what they wanted to hear. Anyway, I hope that one day, the truth will come out and the ones, that still walks free, get the judgement they deserve and that Brendan and Steven Avry will get their freedom back. This is something everyone should see. If I were a parent I would show it to my kids, if I was a teacher I would show it to my students. I will recommend it to everyone I know."
tt5189670,"This is a very disturbing case, i am a local in the area, and there was no insurance coverage for the county on steve's lawsuit, thus, pay it out of the general fund, or get him arrested and sent to prison....one of the biggest problems is how deputy colburn called in the rav4 plate 2 days before it was discovered, then when they played the recording of his call to dispatch, he said he did not recall doing that."
tt5189670,What a women ! She makes me feel powerful and strong ! Women to stand up for what they believe in ! It's so hard sometimes to be a women in this world ! she is in incredible! And so so strong !
tt5189670,"A documentary is supposed to document the facts of something, not pick and choose which facts to use and then cleverly edit the video and audio recordings in order to cause a social media uproar and promote your own careers.I wish there was law to protect victim's families from people like Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos. These filmmakers are masters at taking things out of context and using those things to promote the story they are trying to spin.I'll admit that I was absolutely captivated by the first few episodes which lay out how Steven Avery was convicted of a crime he didn't commit and how the Manitowoc police department failed him in many facets of the investigation and subsequent incarceration. Having said that, when I was watching the episodes related to Steven Avery's trial for raping and killing Teresa Hallbach, I found myself saying, ""No,,,No,, NO WAY can he be found guilty... NOOOO WAYYY!!!"" I couldn't understand how a jury might convict him if they were seeing the evidence we as viewers we seeing. So, I researched the case on my own. I read the transcripts from the multiple confessions Branden Dassey gave and looked over ALL of the evidence which wasn't covered in this film. I quickly realized why Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos left out so much of the evidence. The reason is, the evidence they left out is completely irrefutable. They couldn't take it out of context and make it look like something else, or cast doubt on it. If they hadn't left out all of the extremely damaging facts about this case, no one would have ever heard about their ""documentary"" because it is a clear cut rape and murder committed by a child- molesting animal-torturer and previously accused rapist who had been stalking the victim:If you care at all about this case and the rights of the victim and her family, please do a quick search for what the filmmakers omitted."
tt5189670,"I watched the first season and did not think it was biased in any way. It clearly showed the facts, so outrageous and unbelievable the average person trying to make sense of it often decides that it is ""one sided"". Season 2 is the same, it makes you angry it makes you sad but most of all it gives you hope because Kathleen Zellner is solid and will not stop until these innocent men are free. A must watch."
tt5189670,The story is fascinating and my heart goes out to Steven Avery. But these shows cannot be fully trusted. They may be selling us a lie . He may have been not innocent. Cannot really say. I did not enjoy it as it only showed one side of the story
tt5189670,So much was left out in order to make this tragic story of a life lost into a entertainment piece. It is irresponsible and a horrible thing to do to the victims family.This show clearly manipulated actual court testimonies to create a narrative that law enforcement is bad and the accused now convicted is a victim who was framed. The evidence could not have been more clear in actuality where this show 100% distorted the facts.What is even worse is that they portrayed the convicted to be a nice guy when he had a long and documented history of violence and abuse towards women.Avery absolutely deserves to rot in prison. The kid I feel bad for honestly and hope he can get out one day.
tt5332206,"This is no ordinary series. It demands your unwavering attention and significant exercise from your grey cells.There are multiple arcs and the underlying story is complex and multilayered. The director does excellent job in amalgamating it all into one beautiful seamless narrative. The actors are great with the exception of Lee Je - Hoon (who plays Park Have - Young), who at times seemed laboured. Cho Jin - Woong (who plays Lee Jae - Han) is exceptional, I don't believe I have seen anyone do better in a role. He is the soul of this series. The production values are really high.Yes, it is at times a slow burn and towards the end seems stretched. Liberties have been taken with logic but with a complex script perfection is exceptionally hard to attain.The shortcomings in the script are generally concealed by the director and skill of the actors.Excellent!"
tt5332206,"I watched Signal out of curiosity due to time/science fiction element written in the synopsis but it opened up much further to the excellent acting, plot and story line signal could offer. I wonder if Hollywood would learn a thing or two from this series to produce a different new level of story telling. Will they be releasing season 2 soon? I look forward to it almost anxiously. Will they not do so? I believe with the 16 episodes they aired had made many who watched Signal to expectantly wait if the producers would decide to continue. Its like two parallel earths - one past, the other present. Both worlds connected by a doorway of time. Past changed because of the present and present changes due to the past."
tt5332206,"This is an exciting and fast paced thriller. Any loss of impetus caused by the plot contrivance setting up interweaving times lines is swiftly compensated for by the deft plotting and fine performances. The whole thing is propulsive, carrying you along willingly for the ride.I was going to award the series a 9, but found the final episode disappointing. Everything was left in the air, perhaps for a second series, but this was not the problem. It was the loss of pace as the characters resorted to lengthy exposition to tidy up plot loose ends. Still an 8 though, so don't let this reservation put you off!"
tt5332206,"Normally, i don't bother to write review, but I need to tell everyone how awesome this TV series is. This is the first TV series that didn't make me bored or sleepy while watching it, it's full of suspense and unpredictable plot. It also plays with your emotion, i fell happy, sad, scared, angry, desperate while watching this series.It's how good this series is, it's really draining my brain. I need to think while watching signal, even after i have finished watching it, i am still thinking about it. When I cannot move on even though i have finished watching it, then the movie is a really good one.sorry but i think SIGNAL is better than game of thrones hahaha, you should watch it. Don't miss this great series."
tt5332206,"Why do people of South Korea under rate their movies, TV-series so much? Why? Believe me when I say ""If this show was made in Hollywood, It's rating would have been 9.5 or above"". The amount of thriller provided in just the first four episodes is higher than the aggregate amount of thriller provided by all five seasons of TV series like Breaking Bad. I have watched every good Hollywood movie and TV- series, but I have never reviewed anything, This is my first review and it is coming for a South Korean drama, but the irony is I just don't have words to explain how I feel after watching this show. I am Speechless. I feel so bad when I see that there are not even 500 votes here. These directors, actors and the whole production team needs to be appreciated. They are giving us so much, I can't find ways to thank them. Why the world is living in ignorance? These 18 hours are right here, which can give them a next level thrilling experience. If someone by chance is reading this review, please do yourself a favor and watch this drama."
tt5332206,"This emotionally rich drama chronicles the life of three individuals whose lives are intertwined. The screenplay which realistically beautiful,especially how the characters interact,allows a smooth flow for the narration. Lonely melancholic characters which are perfectly written and easily relatable is one of the aspects that upholds my emotional connection with the film. Sad to see that it is criminally underrated."
tt5332206,"SPOILER: This was an insanely amazing show. From the plot, to the cinematography, to the characters, it was all top-notch. I was hooked and at the edge of my seat throughout all the episodes. The way they weaved the plots from past and present, and used the right amount of suspense to keep us wondering and speculating, were masterful. This is my top series of 2016! (along with Broadchurch, which I only watched in 2016 when it came out on Netflix lol)I'm glad it ended the way it did too - ambiguous and with the promise of more to come. Even if they don't have a series 2, it's perfect the way it is."
tt5332206,If you like movies and series that talk about time travel and full of mystery this series is totally for you to watch.The writer of this series made a phenomenal job with some mind twist ideas every episode hook you up till the last minute all 16 episodes are full of excitement and you don't get bored at all 10/10 would recommend it and i hope to see season 2 for it.
tt5332206,I cannot explain this show just with a few words. So i'm gonna make this short. If you are looking for a K-drama to see or just want have a little tatse. Dont go anywhere far cuz this show is perfect
tt5332206,"I get it. Folks love the lead actors and actress. And I will admit, they are amazing. I like them too. But loving the leads is no reason to rate this show so high. No way does it deserve an 8.5/10 average on IMDB.8/10 - BEGINNING - The premise and starting episodes. Not entirely unique, as there are plenty of split across time communication stories out there. But this one has some grit to it, and the challenges the leads face cause a cohesive and very likable team to form. You're thinking, ""This may be real good.""4/10 - MIDDLE - And that team dynamic becomes why the choices the characters make time and again just so difficult to fathom towards the middle of the show. It's like a standard Korean Crime Drama show trope: ""We have to make sure that our characters stop communicating with each other, start acting alone and erratically, and avoid easy and obvious choices that would make their jobs so much easier!"". And I've said it before, this is simply because Korean writers have a VERY hard time closing out stories once they get going. They rely on random chance encounters, overly bad (or good) luck, and the aforementioned unexplainable behavior of the main characters to move the plot along from point A to point B. This show takes these weaknesses to the extreme. To the point you're groaning and rolling your eyes at the screen.ENDING - 1/10 - Very VERY dissatisfying. Almost like the writers either a) Wanted an artsy stylistic ending that doesn't fit the rest of the show, or b) They were 100% sure they would get a second season...that never came. Unfulfilling to say the least."

tt5332206,"SIGNAL (Sigeuneol) (2016) was such an interesting premise. I really enjoyed this crime series. I'm not sure how to best describe it though. It was such a unique experience. While it was a investigative crime drama series there were also definite amounts of science fiction or possibly even paranormal elements which makes it a very unusual watch for me. I really enjoyed that aspect however, especially blended with criminal investigation aspects. Although a strange mix of genres, it really worked here.I loved Lee Jehoon (as Park Hae-Young). At first I really didn't think I would like him but he ended up being phenomenal in this. He is far from being a stereotypical lead character. I love the emotional connection he gets with cases. Given his background it really endears viewers to him. I love Kim Hye-su (as Detective Cha Soon-hyeon) and Cho Jin-woong (as Detective Lee Jae-han). They are both great actors and their characters are really cool and likable.I also really enjoyed the two timelines. I think they did a great job portraying two different eras and overlapping story and cases. The concept is fascinating. Visually and aesthetically it was appealing and very original series. The acting was great, the story was great, the music was great, I loved the three main characters. Everything was really well done.The main reason I hesitate giving this 10 stars is for a few small reasons. Mainly because of the way it ended. Without giving away any spoilers I will only say the ending felt very open-ended, and hopefully it is open-ended intentionally for the purpose of sequel seasons. Until then, I hesitate in rating it too highly because it felt incomplete and needed so much more. Secondly, while I loved the three main characters so much, many of the other side characters felt a bit flat to me. I felt there could have been more depth and character building. Otherwise this show was so unique and worthwhile.While Signal is very intriguing and full of heart, it also has a very dark and dreary feeling, with a lot of very sad themes (i.e. Murder, corruption, suicide, rape, etc.) and not a lot of happy moments to balance it. The overall mood of the show is very heavy. A lot of the story revolves around some very depressing, tragic themes and is quite hard to handle at times. Even still, this is one of my all time favorites.[EDIT: There are rumors there will be a season 2!]STORY: 10/10

tt5332206,"I really love korean movies, but this was my 1st korean series. I was blown away by the amazing story, the incredible acting and the pace that keeps you glued to the screen from start to finish.
It has everything, love story, drama, thriller, comedy and even some sci fi element. I promise it's impossible not to love."
tt5332206,"This is first Korean Drama i watched and i am really glad that i did.. This is my review of any thing. I have watched many English TV shows but after a while they change story or no longer are exited compare to first episodes. but this is on whole another new level..Everything is just amazing story,acting,suspense. Writer just created her own new world.. I could feel, how characters felt for each other in this show.. nothing was forced or dragged too long.. I highly recommend this who is reading this.. Even at the last episodes, last minute i couldn't guess what was going to happen this is masterpiece of thriller genre.. and also soundtracks wow just amazing every music in this was amazing.. i really wish this was longer than just only 16 episodes.."
tt5332206,"A unique spin to time travel. Solid drama with detectives solving crimes in two time periods. With each episode, you learn a little more why it is that those two detectives are the ones communicating through this magic walkie-talkie. When this series ended, I was left wanting so much more!"
tt5332206,Wowwwwww this series is a must watch for anyone who like thriller series with exceptionally well stories plotting. I highly recommend this series. I enjoyed every episode and never got bored even for a second. Highly highly highly recommend this series.
tt5332206,"Writing a review for Signal is a bit hard. I am conflicted between loving it and hating it. I found it at times to be so amazing but an episode later so terrible. Let me break it down:THE GOOD: The series from ep 2 to 13 was just amazing. It had a good pacing, well weaved story spanning timelines & superb layering of mystery that keeps one glued to the screen. There's also sub-plots that builds itself along side the main-plot that helped to drive the overall plot.Kim Hye-Soo's performance also made the series worthwhile and engaging. She did such a great job portraying the development of a character who went from being awkward shy newbie to a determined stoic detective. I feel what made her performance so great for me is the fact that Kim Hye-Soo is not afraid ugly crying and being super awkward. I appreciate her willingness to just be ridiculous in front of camera as it cut the tension and gave the series some comedic relief moments.THE BAD: I almost gave up on this series, as episode 1 felt rushed to fit everything possible into it. Introduce all the characters, complete a sub-plot, present the entire mystery and wrap it all up. It felt very disjointed and should have been done a bit slower.The irony is that towards the end of the series, it had the opposite problem. I would have given this higher rating if it wasn't for the extreme slow and pointless episodes 14 and 15. I kept hitting the fast forward button as these episodes became such a bore. These episodes were just a long repeat of previously shown scenes, endless slow overlapping shots of characters (especially Park Hae-Yeong) looking depressed/bewildered & a drag of pointless dialogue that doesn't progress the story. I started to find Park Hae-Yeong to be an extremely dreary character who seems to only have one emotion. It honestly felt as if I was watching Eeyore try to solve a crime. I found the acting Lee-Je-hon a bit bland as he seems to only have one default emotion and, thus, one expression the entire show.The series does end on a cliff hanger, setting up for a season 2. I am a bit sceptical of how good the second season would be as the later episodes of the first series didn't seem to have a lot of story left."
tt5332206,Unbearable and frustrating to watch the last few episodes to say the least. A very good plot let down by the need to make it extra dramatic and soapy. What a letdown!
tt5332206,"Stellar cast, script, direction, and OST in a great series."
tt5332206,"While most tv from Hollywood or India increasingly relies on sex and gore to sell itself, this TV series shows that you don't need any explicit stuff to get people interested if you have an intriguing plot. The sheer complexity of the plot is handled with such finesse that it makes 'Game of Thrones' look like it's written by a bunch of juveniles. After watching this you can't go back to watching stuff like Arrow, Flash. Pure garbage. Also, worth mentioning is the emotional depth of the series. I'm the last person on earth to jerk a tear but this one made me. This TV series should be a reference guide on how humans emotions should be crafted and conveyed in cinema. It's a masterpiece!"
tt3762198,"It's been a very long time since the golden age of British sitcoms, back in the 90s. Since then, we've seen very little in the way of outstanding, memorable stuff. The last truly great one, in my opinion, was Peep Show which finished last year and you'd have to go back to The Office before that (though I'd like to give a shout out to Plebs, which although not in the same league is still very good). Well now, we've finally got another one.It's very much inspired by The Office and much of the acting (particularly from the two main characters, Beats and Grindah) clearly has Ricky Gervais's imprint all over it. I don't see this as a bad thing though and if you liked The Office you'll love this. As will anyone with a passing knowledge of inner city life in the UK, the DJ / underground music scene or even if you just like laughing at the ""chavvy"" end of society. Most of us will recognise at least one of these 4 main protagonists or the characters they associate with, in real life and it all rings very true, particularly the dialogue which is expertly done.What this is doing languishing on BBC 3 is anyone's guess but it certainly deserves a larger audience. I cannot recommend this highly enough, I haven't laughed so much in years!"
tt3762198,"I am just a bit distraught that this will only be the 4th review on IMDb for this show. 8.6 is great but even after 3 series it still doesn't have the coverage it deserves. If they don't get more recognition they might not make any more. Plus how will Chabuddy ever get his own show? Or how about Chabuddy G winning an apprentice special. Think, misfits, spaced, Nathan barley crossed with spinal tap type genius. Mockumentry style with a clever low grade uk/Australian sense of place and time. It's not like it's 1998 is it mate. I've been kurupted!"
tt3762198,"Look it's taken a lockdown and Worldwide pandemic for me to finally stop skipping all the recommendations from BBCi and Netflix but this comedy really hits home.First I loathe all the music , the MC etc that is part of the greatness of this indy type comedy that looks at times its shot on a 90s video cam.
I have met every character in this show , I have wanted to knock out ( yes physically) the Grindah guy for well being Grindah.
Michelle so radiated as my sister in law who I had to rescue from a burke like Grindah .I've had a friend like Chabuddy G , was pestered by an older woman at this age by a woman just like Carol. And all the other mates the Go-for , the partner in crime who is actually a decent person and would be far better off without the influence of the selfish Grindah.I get angry watching this but funny angry because it's so raw.I'm only at the back of series 3 so I dont know anything further but the younger in cheek joke with Michelle and Decoy is so well played out that I believe that if this was real that Mich is oblivious to it all. The christening or "" Christian "" is top notch quality humor.This may seem that its comedy for the dumb illiterate but it's very much cultivated and those involved have turned this into a erudite classic.Well done the BBC 3 team 👌"
tt3762198,"At first glance this is another British mockumentary in the same vein as The Office. Pathetic characters in normal situations that are familiar yet far-fetched. We laugh at these people with a 'there but for the grace of god' sigh of relief. And yet there's something very real about the characters we meet in this comedy. Even if you don't live in a council tower block you either know people like this or know that people like this exist. The ambitions and eventual failure in achieving them by these sorry losers is very real. They're decent, (fairly) honest people caught in a trap and you're really cheering for them, but if they came up trumps it wouldn't be funny. The comedy is in their failure. Like many people of my generation who were aspiring DJs, spending countless nights on the decks with their mates getting stoned, there's so much in this that rings true, and these relatively unknown actors do a superb job in making it all feel so real. We laugh with them, we laugh at them, then we come away feeling really bad for them, and it's this subtle fine-line that makes this new comedy really stand out."
tt3762198,"Firmly in the tradition of the Office and Phoenix Nights comes this gem following the day to day ups and downs of a group of friends running a pirate radio station in a bedraggled West London neighborhood. We meet best pals, the wonderfully delusional MC Grindah and the loyal, clearly talented but dim DJ Kevin ""Beats"" Bates who run Brentford's top Garage/DnB,Grime Pirate radio station Kurupt FM. Not very ably assisted by child-like stoner Steves and modest & quiet DJ Decoy; the lads face the day to day struggles of keeping their station going and managing their complicated private lives. The ambitious but severely deluded local 'entrepreneur' Chabuddy G provides the station with much needed help & advice that usually brings chaos to the group, while Grindah's housewife/hair dresser girlfriend provides the vital ego massaging that a 'genius' like Grindah needs. Much of the comedy comes from Grindah's frustration at not being a mega star and with his loyal but dimwitted crew who seemingly frustrate his every move as well as the buffoon- ish but well intentioned Chabuddy's attempts to help his friends. This sort of thing has been done before and a lot of Grindah's mugging to camera is straight from the Ricky Gervais school of comedy but this is clearly a labour of love for the cast, about music they clearly have a passion and talent for. Truly a joy to watch the writing and acting (much of which is ab- libbed) are fantastic. A Bad News Tour or Spinal Tap for modern British urban music."
tt3762198,It's so close to being exactly how I grew up it's uncanny! Brilliant! So well written! I love it!
tt3762198,This series is fantastic. I guess if your one of these people ( they do exist ) you may not find it funny. Other wise it is great observational comedy. The characters are endearing and horrific at the same moment. The total delusion of grandeur these people have is so on point. The worrying thing from my point of view is I like the music they play. Well worth a watch.
tt3762198,"I haven't found myself rewatching a comedy series like this since Trailer Park Boys. There's something about watching v likable people on the fringes of society trying to make something of their lives but constantly getting in their own way. The unspoken bond between these losers is killer chemistry, they all feel so believable and real but executed in such a subtly hilarious way that the best mocumentarys capture. They literally have 2 crew members that are always hanging out in the background with their own lives but are also constantly told to shut up so we're left with these super brief glimpses into what kind of people they really are. This would obnoxious if it wasnt handled so brilliantly and believably, the way this show is shot adds alot to illusion of realism. I love this show and more people need to know about ""People Just Do Nothing"" because it's literally one of the best comedy shows of the decade and I'm literally just finding out about it."
tt3762198,"If your a fan of the Office or any mockumentry comedy then People just do nothing will be for you. The premise of the show is simple a bunch of no hoppers from Brentford trying to run an illegal urban grind radio station. They are of course completely useless with only themselves and those close to them thinking they are any good. There are obvious comparisons to the Office the playing up to the cameras, the odd embarrassed glance when they realise there being filmed. But like the Office at some point in our life we have meet people like these characters, and as hopeless as they are you can't help but care about them. 8/10"
tt3762198,If you like dry humor this show is so funny it's bonkers.... like dry humor so good Larry David should take a pen and notebook out. Watch this show!
tt3762198,"This sitcom must go down as one of the most underrated tv programmes of all time.
The writing is brilliant the characters are superb,growing up in West London myself,I actually have seen people like this!!😂😂Gutted when they called it a day but fair play to these guys...surely though...Cha buddy g needs his own show?????"
tt3762198,"I enjoyed the show first time around 9/10 for sure so thought I'd come back and rewatch before the questionable movie is watched to catch up, it was mostly how I remember it but I found after a few series that I was really tired of grinda and chabuddy, just felt rewatching shows is a big thing for comedies but rewatching this just irritates me. Grinda especially I just found to be so ridiculously obnoxious and nasty that I hadn't picked up on that and equally CG was just forcing humour it didn't feel organic this time round, I enjoyed beats family dynamics and Steves is just awesome but I also couldn't understand why decoy is even there or who the other rando was added in S3, but decoy visibly didn't like them wasn't getting paid so it made no sense.Dunno second time round it was decent just not as organically funny as I remember."
tt3762198,"So, y'know that thing in comedy these days where awful people are so painfully well-written that they're not actually funny characters? Where, instead of being over-the-top, they're just the idiots that live 'round the corner, and all the situations are boring dross that could happen on a Tuesday?Yeh. It's one of those. The BBC is trying to bolster the economy with them now that The Office has been so long off-air.The essence of humor is the unexpected, and there's nothing unexpected about a bunch of bell-ends stumbling through a world of mundane cock-ups."
tt3762198,"As an American I sadly was not in London when pirate radio and garage was popping. Nonetheless, the show managed to keep me invested in the story and the characters. While season one was slow, I'm glad I continued watching as the show gets much better. Season 4 was a little bit weak, but that's probably just because I wasn't a fan of Grindah's character in it. But the show managed to end on a high note with a good season 5 and a great ending. Overall the show is well worth a watch, and got me listening to some new music as well."
tt3762198,"It's hard for me to review People Just Do Nothing, as in many ways it is two shows. Episodes 1.1 to 4.1 are a solid run of quality, as the show grows in confidence, and the writing and performances become more and more sophisticated - the tapestry gradually expands and each episode builds on the last, making the series feel like an incredibly real world. Characters grow in meaningful ways, the show subverts expectations in intelligent ways, jokes are never overlaboured, scripts are densely written, the cast's chemistry is natural, the improvisation is fantastic, and there's a subtle but powerful political undercurrent. Series 2 and 3 are just superb - series 2 is probably the funniest and is when the show really comes into its own, but series 3 is a tour de force with fantastic arcs and character work. By the end of series 3 the show is firing on every cylinder - it's great to see a sitcom that's so ambitious and such a labour of love, and that takes its characters and their lives so seriously. My average ranking for episodes 1.1 to 4.1 is a stellar 8.8/10.There's a sharp change in the tone of the show and the quality of the scripts just over halfway through the run, for reasons I'm unsure of. This final 11-episode run (from episode 4.2 to 5.6) isn't entirely bad - episodes 5.1-5.3 are a brief and welcome return to form - but by this point it was clear the show had lost steam and direction and the actors had begun to tire of the characters. Worse, the characters stopped growing and in some cases their development actually went backwards, reducing them to unlikable caricatures (where in earlier series, despite if not because of their flaws, they were all relatable and sympathetic). So it was sad to see a show I was incredibly passionate about jump the shark and peter out, especially when it could have chosen a brave and powerful ending given the way the cards were being stacked in series 3. Series 5 was also a missed opportunity for social commentary on gentrification and social engineering, a main driver of the plot but one that is barely explored.Despite these misgivings, I believe the show deserves a 9/10 overall as it is and will remain a classic based on the strength of those first 3 series - there's nothing else like them. These characters will find a way into your heart."
tt3762198,"I was involved with pirate radio in Manchester during early 90's so this series plays close to my heart. I'm now mid 40's and pretty much laughed , cried or both throughout the whole show. Never has a tv series hit the reminisce button so hard. You get drawn into the lives of everyone regardless of how much a part they play.
You want to be as enthusiastic as Grindah & Beats.
You want to give Miche a hug.
You want to chill and have a zoot with Decoy & Fantasy.
Everyone needs a Steves in their life and I guarantee you will never anywhere else on TV find a character like Chabuddy G.
All I can say to the cast and crew is THANK YOU and keep it Kurrupt x"
tt3762198,"This show is so cleverly written, directed and executed, with a strong ensemble cast delivering some of the best quality comedy on TV today.So many people just won't get the humour, it's very much in the Ricky Gervais, Marmite style humour. I love it!The friendship and camaraderie comes across with the situational irony and the constant misfired plans has resonance with ""it's always sunny in Philadelphia"", another group of ""idiots""."
tt3762198,This is without doubt the best combination of humour and likeable characters I've ever seen in a tv series. I can relate to the characters and lifestyle .... the close bonds that often grow out of struggling. You will laugh a lot.... and hopefully you will also empathise with the situations they find themselves in. Extremely clever portrait of modern day friendships and life for a lot of young males in the uk. Loved every minute.
tt3762198,Funny especially if you love Jungle. It is the Urban version of The Office. I hated The Office but couldnt stop watching this. I wish they had more seasons.
tt3762198,"It's not an original observation that 'People Just Do Nothing' is like 'Only Fools and Horses' for a new generation, a loser comedy set in unremarkable London. The latter program became comfortable as it became huge, this one still has an edge; but don't let that edge blind you to what is basically classic sitcom territory of incompetenance, misfortune, and lack-of-self-awareneess. There are some brilliant lines here, and a cast of characters whose monstrousness is somehow not sufficient to make you dislike them. The ending (to the fourth series) is surprisiningly downbeat; but there's a lot to like (and laugh at) along the way."
tt3762198,"One of the best comedies of recent years and some of the most well-observed satire you could ever hope to see. Such a great concept for a show and bought to life perfectly by an amazing cast. The fact that some of these guys have lived this lifestyle (and can actually perform pretty well) helps make the satire even more astute.Allan Mustafa and Hugo Chegwin are perfectly cringeworthy and they are ably assisted by the genuinely hilarious combo of Steve Stamp and Asim Chaudhry. The underrated Ruth Bratt is also excellent.There are also a lot of not-so-subtle digs at popular culture and social media usage. Lily Brazier is particularly adept at portraying the trashy young reality-TV wannabe women of the world. The velour tracksuits and 'Live, Love, Laugh' style decor are such a great touch.There is a drop off in quality towards the end and the show should probably have wrapped things up after season 3. Grindah becomes increasingly horrible which makes some scenes borderline uncomfortable, especially as poor old Mich is actually very likeable. But its hard to be too critical of such an original and hilarious show. One of the best UK comedies since The Office."
tt3762198,4 series of this bilge is testament to the current Comdey vacuum at the BBC... Characters depicting work-shy council estate scum fails on all comedic levels... How the BBC ever thought this Dregs of Society mockumentary would appeal to anybody other than the great-unwashed is beyond belief.
tt3762198,"Simply excellent. Flawed characters of questionable intelligence all bounce off one another in a veritable feast of posturing and pretending while, all around, the same boring urban sludge keeps them locked in.
Miche is an underrated character who makes you feel so sorry for her one minute and makes you despise her the next. She is so sweet and caring but has ended up in this environment due to a series of mistakes that even she is oblivious to.
Beats is a favourite, as is Roche (who acts as our audience surrogate as she's the only one deemed as normal) while Decoy's looks to camera are all-telling.
The show wouldn't work if Mustafa, who plays the egomaniac Grindah, was a bad MC. He's excellent, if without any awareness that it's no longer 2001. The fact they all have old phones and use the language of the turn of the Millennium is designed to make us question if this is a period piece. They are the period piece, and they don't even know it.
Very clever, very funny and tragicomedy galore in the heart of Brentford. Keep it Kurupt."
tt3762198,This is flipping hilarious! It gets better as it goes along and never gets boring the cast are immaculate & hysterical and gel perfectly. All that & The music takes me back & my old manor so yea it's definitely a10!
tt3762198,"Put this on one night with looking for a new series to watch and was instantly hooked....funny from the start but once you get to know the characters it gets hilarious, if you like this country and the office this should be right up your street, British comedy at its best."
tt5071412,"I know it hasn't been long since it ended but I already miss Ozark. This show absolutely, without a doubt, lives up to all the hype it gets. It's a gripping thriller where the tension continues to build throughout each episode and each season and then pays off in a huge way. It really is a must watch show. People like to compare it to Breaking Bad and while I don't agree with that comparison because BB is the better show, Ozark is still terrific and worth every second. The one thing I can't stand about this show is Laura Linney's character (Wendy). While I don't mind Linney as an actress, because she's a pretty good one, in this she plays an annoying know it all who doesn't appreciate anything. Again, it's not her fault, it's just the way her character was written and as annoying as she was it still doesn't take away from the fact that this is such a great show."
tt5071412,"The first season was GRIPPING and by the first couple episodes so much had already been established in terms of development, suspense, and thrill. I loved Micheal and was rooting for his cause so that by the time season one ended I was ready for the same amount of quality, but to my surprise it slowed down considerably in season two, the whole season dragged on and although it was entertaining to watch it felt like there was a lull in the pacing. Whereas, in season one, by episode five we already had many over-acrhing plot lines, in season two there seemed to be too much a straight path for what the actions where going to be making it predictable.Season two definitely had its surprising moments, but compared to season one is palled in comparison. Finally season three everything went downhill and there was no more suspense for me it felt like the show just dragged on and the characters lost their lustre and relatability. They had made terrible choice after terrible choice that I no longer cared what happened to the byrde's.Overall it's a great show, with amazing acting from the whole cast. Jason Baetman did a fantastic job with the show, but unfortunately it succumbed to Netflix's plague of dragging on."
tt5071412,"The best way to describe Ozark is that it's just a flat out awesome show and a must watch! I'm so glad that I did finally start watching it because it's become one of my favorite shows of all-time. Everything about this show is excellent...the acting, writing, directing, production, cinematography, etc. Are all as good as it gets. The acting is so good that you really come to care for these characters and what happens to them even though they're not exactly the best human beings possible. I can not overstate just how good this show really is. It's one of the rare shows where every season is just as good as the others. The only negative would have to be the ending. While not the worst ending ever it's also not very good. It doesn't mean the show wasn't worth watching because you'll have fun for the majority of it but a little disappointed in the ending."
tt5071412,"Marty and his family move to the Ozarks to wash money for the mob. What ensues is a wild ride from beginning to end with the audience on tenterhooks for the most part.The characters are wonderfully etched out and watching them cheat the inevitable is the most fun part of the 4 seasons.Ruth Langmore (Julia Garner) is probably my favorite character, second only to Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) and that's primarily because he's relegated to the backseat towards the end of the series.While almost everyone tends to call this the Breaking Bad of money laundering, it is far more than that. At the heart of it, its about idealogical differences that are constantly pulling this family apart, while their toxic seeds end up affecting many innocent and not so innocent people along the way.The series ends on a slightly salty note, but that shouldn't affect the journey.My only grouse was that I hated Wendy Byrde (Laura Linney) with all my heart and I would've loved to see comeuppance for her.My personal barometer for any show is that if I get anxious for the characters, its a good show. This show brought out my anxiety in spades.Go watch!"
tt5071412,"I just finished watching this show for a second time and I have more appreciation for it this time 'round. All the actors mange to achieve a perfect balance of comedy, drama, and pain. One second you're rooting for Wendy, the next you hate her! Same with Ruth, Darlene, Jonah and Charlotte - even Marty! Each character manages to display such a wide range of motivations and emotions. Don't get me started on the cinematography! Each shot appears so intentionally artistic, drawing attention to exactly where it needs to be, revealing things about the direction of the plot and characters without words. I could go on for ages about how much I adore this show. Please give it a watch if you haven't already."
tt5071412,"In the gritty world of crime dramas, ""Ozark"" shines as a beacon of excellence, delivering a masterclass in tension, storytelling, and character development. With its dark and brooding atmosphere, impeccable performances, and intricate plot twists, this series is a rollercoaster ride that you won't want to end.Jason Bateman's portrayal of Marty Byrde, a financial planner turned money launderer, is nothing short of extraordinary. His ability to seamlessly switch between charm and menace is a testament to his acting prowess. Paired with Laura Linney's captivating performance as Wendy Byrde, the power couple at the center of the chaos, the chemistry between the two leads elevates the show to new heights.What sets ""Ozark"" apart is its unflinching look at the consequences of criminality and the lengths people will go to protect themselves and their families. The moral dilemmas faced by the characters are palpable, and the stakes are always high, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from Julia Garner as the cunning Ruth Langmore and Tom Pelphrey as the troubled Ben Davis. Each character is fleshed out with depth and nuance, making the tangled web of alliances and betrayals all the more compelling.With its intricate storytelling, impeccable direction, and haunting score, ""Ozark"" is a true gem in the world of television. It's a show that demands your attention and rewards it with richly layered narratives and heart-pounding suspense.In conclusion, ""Ozark"" is a must-watch for any fan of gripping drama and intricate character studies. With a rating of 9/10, this series cements its place as one of the finest shows on television today."
tt5071412,This series is a home run for Netflix. Its a gripping series with superb casting for every character. It is an edge of your seat thriller that grips the audience from the very start. Throughout each episode you are helplessly wondering how Jason Bateman's character will pull through. The writers of the show are spot on with every twist. I highly recommend giving this series a chance and i can't wait for season 2 to come out. From the first episode to the last it is a brilliant masterpiece that deserves better reviews than other people have given. %100 one of the best new series of the year.
tt5071412,"The first seasons were solid, great actors and story. At the end of season 3 and going into 4 I got tired of the byrds, they are getting more desperate and it got more unbelievable. The story got more of the same and glad it wrapped up. I'm glad they don't drag on the story and keep it to these 4 seasons."
tt5071412,"Ozark was such an amazing show during his 3 first seasons, a masterpiece of drama combining poignant intrigue, mastered production, meticulous writing touched by a dose of skillfully distilled black humor. It's was one of my favorites shows and one of the few that I rated 10 but now i just give it a 9 because the season finale has completely ruined my love for this show because this season 4 was so bad oh my god...Season 4 is lack of action, tension or typical Ozark's plot twist/violence. The pace is extremely slow and storyline does not conclude properly. Everything goes so fast around the last 30 minutes, and so many questions to answer. It's predictable, and weak compared to the quality of the 3 first seasons, did they switch of writers or what ?There was characters coming in and out and one minute they all hate each other and then don't. It was just inconsistent and felt like they weren't sure how to finish everything. A lot of plots ultimately lead to nothing more than a pointless storyline.The ending is a joke, it doesn't feel like an ending. Just a regression of most of the characters and the final scene is nonsense in every conceivable way. Ozark ending fails while Sopranos ending doesn't. The writers did not spend any effort on the final and find how to resolve the built-up tension through four seasons! It felt like a last-minute homework of a terrible student. What a waste, this season finale just ruins the show !"
tt5071412,"I never would have watched this if not for the quarantine. It wasn't promoted well.
I LOVED IT! Great script, tons of action and characters that you love to hate and hate to love."
tt5071412,"Ozark sets itself in a high stakes environment and carries that high intensity throughout the series . The episodes and story are easy to watch and don't drag anything too much . As someone who gets bored very quickly , it kept me on my seat from the beginning .Jason Bateman gives an exceptional performance . Probably the most likable anti-hero ever . Same goes for all the other characters in the Byrde family .However in spite of all of this , the ending left me utterly confused and disappointed and looking for answers . I felt that the writers had created something that they could not handle and thus fumbled the ending with so many open threads .I highly recommend it regardless of that . You will enjoy . Go in with an open mind . Also stay off reddit and the wiki to avoid spoilers."
tt5071412,Ozark is pretty much what you'd expect it to be. Its a pretty tense what-is-he-going-to-do-now type of storytelling that makes it easy to binge-watch.It also holds your attention as Jason Bateman plays a similar kind of character as the likable anti-hero keeps falling in trouble.Similar to breaking bad but also quite different.
tt5071412,I loved Ozark through ALL it's seasons but the final episode did not do the series justice. It frankly left me flat and disappointed. It left giant holes in the plot and could've done some characters better justice.
tt5071412,"It was a very riveting series with lots of twists and turns throughout. The characters were very real people, very believable situation in these times with the cartels in this world. It is not a show in my opinion for a young audience even though it's not hard to believe this is how things are for real
people in the underworld of drug cartels and weapons etc. My only complaint is that the show was very hard to view, it is very dark. A lot of the show it was like watching a black screen. It was frustrating wondering what was taking place for a lot of it. All in all great acting and a good story line."
tt6763664,"When I was starting the series, I kept thinking to myself that the characters and their dialogues are more interesting in the book. But as I went on a few episodes more, I thought this take off of the book is so creative. The storyline was far off from the book but the theme remained. My favorite episodes were: ""Touch. I really felt Theo's character"", ""The Bent-Neck Lady. Poor Nellie. The same thing I said when I was reading the novel: Poor Eleanor"", ""The Two Storms. Just because of the multiple one shots, and the smooth transitions between then and now situations, and the intense acting from the entire cast"", ""Screaming Meemies. On to my most favorite episode and character. Olivia was the perfect cast for a mother in this genre. One that brings peace and horror to the family; peace with her voice and horror to the mind. She might have the same voice as Meryl Streep when she cries and talks at the same time. The whispery, heavy breathy tone. Well, maybe it's just me"".Hill House... those who walked there, walked together.It just makes perfect sense."
tt6763664,"Okay, this is my first review ever. I first watched the Haunting of Hill House in 2018 since it was released. I watched it the second time in 2019 and now - in 2022 - the third time. It made me come back to it the third time since there hasn't been a better horror series released than this. I missed the experience watching it so I wanted to experience it again. It's the only series I've ever watched so many times. Not one series have I even watched twice. Everytime it scared the s**t out of me, especially the bent neck lady. Everytime it also made me cry, especially the last episode. Everytime I realized something more from the story and the characters. The acting, the atmosphere, the story - it's so captivating and keeps you at the edge of your seat. Time will tell if I'll come back to it for the fourth time (wouldn't be surprised, it's so good)."
tt6763664,"The Haunting of Hill House is HANDS DOWN the best horror series I've ever seen. It's a meditation on death, grief and trauma. It is equal parts scary and engaging. The best character development I've seen in a long time and a huge leap forward for horror. We need more horror like this. It has disturbed me and moved me. It's portrayal of the supernatural as more of a human experience and less of a ""poltergeist"" type is revolutionary. It, to me, makes more sense to believe in ghosts than I ever thought was possible"
tt6763664,"As a premise I must say that I generally don't like ghost stories, so I approached Hill House without expecting much. Overall I enjoyed it, although there are some flaws. I'll start with what I didn't like:a) the extreme slowness of many of the scenes and some dialogues, which at times are drawn out unnecessarily longb) the repetitive mechanism of disturbing scenes which then turn out to be dreams with the protagonist who awakens with a start. This clichè is used too oftenc) In addition to the scenes and some dialogues being too long, the narration of the overall story is also very diluted; a good 30% of each episode is dedicated to shots that slowly advance through the corridors of the house without anything happening. I would have appreciated a greater narrative synthesisd) The beginning is very scattered and it is necessary to get to episode six to put together the threads of the story (however, this could paradoxically also be a plus point)Coming instead to what I appreciated, I say:a) the characterization of the various characters, truly excellent. The brothers and sisters each stand out with their own characteristics both as children and adults, and the same goes for the parents and the few other charactersb) The setting is both spooky and majesticc) the photography with dark colors to the right point but also luminous when necessaryd) The tragic characters of Olivia and Nell are truly moving and perfectly delineatede) Episode 5 ""The Woman with the Bent Neck"", tells Nell's story in a remarkable and moving way ; one of the best episodes of a TV series of all timef) The figure of the father, almost evanescent at the beginning, is clarified at the end and takes on an unexpected depth.Overall I therefore appreciated the series, although in my opinion it would have been more effective to concentrate the story in eight episodes."
tt6763664,"Monologues for days. Just so, so many ""poignant"" monologues. So, so many self-reflective, melodramatic monologues. 
Long speeches aside, the production value is great. The child actors are fantastic. The story is intriguing, though it tends to only creep along. Quite good, but not perfect, as it's high rating suggests."
tt6763664,"It blows my mind that reviews call this ""the perfect horror"" or ""scary"" in any way. It's a family drama that happens to take place in a haunted house. Couple jump scares but 99% is over-acted monologues by mediocre actors. Nell's episode is the only one that was well acted, entertaining, and slightly creepy."
tt6763664,"Really well written and acted, with a good story and characters. Thos is everything AHS should have been."
tt6763664,"Everything about this show was excellent in concept and execution. Writing, casting, acting, directing, cinematography ect... were great. A true tour de force of visual media. The show contains such sensible and intellectual ideas about grief and family that makes it so hopeful in the end, despite being gut-wrenching and terrifying. Although this is supernatural horror, it is well grounded in reality, even more than some ""realistic"" horror films.I have re-watched this show about 4 times, and I will be watching it many more times in the future. I can't recommend ""The Haunting of Hill House"" enough."
tt6763664,I DESPERATELY want a story about Hill House's past to see Poppy's entire story
tt6763664,"Stephen King ranted about Shirley Jackson's original book the haunting of hill house 1959. In Dance Macabre, King isolated Dracula, Frankenstein, wearwolf and hauntings. He also spoke a lot about the fact that a good horror needs to be relevant to the times. For example, the Star Wars bad guys didn't accidentally look like German soldiers. More recently, black mirror has us all panicking about the rise of technology, big brother and privacy. Based on this, one would surmise that both King and Jackson would be delighted with the Netflix reboot of haunting of hill house 2019.Themes of mental health, trauma, attachment, dysfunctional families, secrets, love and passion and generally maladaptive coping strategies in difficult times are key elements. These higher order messages pair nicely with a good share of things that go bump in the night, boo scares and grossness.The parallel storyline's of past and present allow the story to be told and the plot to unravel simultaneously. Time is irrelevant with trauma and as Nessie says, I am like fresh snowflakes across all of your life. ""There's no without, I am not gone. I'm scattered into so many pieces, sprinkled on your life like new snow.""Fantastic cinematography allows for long, purposefully uncomfortable scenes that almost bring the viewer right into the house to share the discomfort. Unlike some other recent binge watches, (walking dead, handmaids tale), the discomfort is pleasantly scary rather than boringly annoyingly reliant on , long boring shots of over done face acting.Early on in the piece, there are scenes where people openly acknowledge seeing the same ghostly vision, which means that you need to believe early on that ghosts exist. They also acknowledge that certain supernatural powers exist. Even with this, there is a compelling counter arguament about mental health with genuine mental illness and drug abuse running parallel to the haunting. Is the haunting supernatural or psychological?The plot tells a story where the house follows and haunts people as they grow older. Leaving the house doesn't fix things but returning to it risks death. Unfinished business seems to be the narrative.Interestingly, other ghosts in the house aren't there to haunt you. Although the mischievous ones can if you let them. They are there in their own journey.There are plenty of Easter eggs to be searched for, from figures in the background and carvings on the wall to the character resemblance from the original version.Love and passion right or wrong, Hugh talks about arguing with passion. The house is much the same, initially causing malice but as things progress, you begin to see the love within the walls of the house and you can see some goodness from its standpoint. Perhaps the source of the trauma may not embody the evil but just be a piece of the bigger knotWhen the Forever house's footprint is drawn into the master blueprint for the house, the real horror is named. Our biggest fear that we will become trapped in our forever house with it being not what we dreamed of. The house is a metaphor for the haunting of our life, work and marriage. We are haunted by our past and present and future as well as integenerational traumas. Our responses are the same as ghosts and whether avoid, ignore, dissociate, abuse drugs and alcohol, enable or suppress it."
tt6763664,"Show is decent but I am writing this review because of headlines saying ""they had to release the trailer in day because of how scary it was"". Another one saying "" show is so scary that it's making people vomit and pass out"" really ?I am starting to think that Netflix is hyping the shows by buying out the reviews. Show had a decent storyline but it was not very scary. I just don't get the hype."
tt6763664,"How on earth does this thing have an 8.9/10 rating (as of Nov 2018)? This was one of the most frustrating viewing experiences I've had in years. I wouldn't have guessed it from the first few episodes, which I enjoyed despite some misgivings, but by the time the last one rolled around I was saying ""Oh god not another monologue"" every ten minutes.There are some impressive storytelling flourishes - I'll give it that, and a lot of work obviously went into the production. But that can't save a series that feels bloated, self-indulgent, overly verbose and melodramatic and stuffed with monologues.It also features many of the frustrating habits of horror films - parents that don't listen to children and dismiss whatever they say; adults that repress supernatural experiences despite overwhelming evidence; poor communication between characters (there would be no show if these people spoke to each other); characters who ignore all the signs and engage the supernatural by themselves in the dead of night without telling anyone else, etc. And it's not that I don't like horrors. I love a good horror - but with this one (and with so many modern horrors), the overall arc of the storytelling feels cheap and pointless. Never again will I trust the hype around a show without doing some research myself."
tt6763664,This is what I've been waiting for. I am a huge horror fan and a huge fun of this show. I almost cried at the end of episode one because I've been waiting for a show like this for so long. Thank you!
tt7120662,One of the top 10 funniest shows I have ever seen and I am a 65 yr. old American. I just binged Season 2 and happy to report Season 3 has been confirmed. I don't often laugh out loud in my home when viewing comedy yet every episode has made me do so. Every cast member is brilliant and so is the writing. I was utteriy amazed that Clare and Michelle are in their 30's. The other 2 girls are 25. It is a testament to their acting ability that they portray teenagers so convincingly. I hope Season 3 has about 10 episodes instead of 6.
tt7120662,"Hilarious, quick, quirky and brilliantly written. Funniest thing on Netflix. Set in Northern Ireland during the troubles, the jokes come from all directions-family, growing up, fitting in, Catholic schools, the folly of religious conflicts, and on and on. Lisa McGee has created a phenomenal show populated with engagingly funny characters everywhere you turn."
tt7120662,"This show is a heartwarming and hilarious
Brilliant writing and how it's set in Ireland during the troubles in the 90s is just very clever and brilliant"
tt7120662,"Derry Girls is one of the best new comedies I have seen on TV in recent times. There's great chemistry between the lead characters who are all likable and have their own hilarious personal traits. The supporting cast are also excellent, Grandad Joe in particular I thought was very funny. I laughed a lot throughout the series and it also handled some sensitive subjects very well. I am glad that it's already been confirmed we will have a series 2!"
tt7120662,"A thoroughly enjoyable and hilarious addition to channel 4's comedic offerings. The extreme success of 'Derry Girls' lies deeply rooted in the effective well-rounded development of the main and recurring characters. With all four of the Derry Girls being totally antithetical to each other, the show seemingly appeals to a wide and diverse audience without losing sight of its purpose as a comedy. 
Set in 1990s Derry, McGee intricately intertwines the treacherous and realistic political undertones as an effective backdrop to successfully juxtapose the comedic on-goings in the lives of the core characters. It should win lots of awards."
tt7120662,"I do not normally watch shows like this, but I found it to be laugh-out-loud funny."
tt7120662,"I'd almost given up on TV sit-coms, in fact the last one I really enjoyed was ""The I.T. Guys"" and how many years ago was that? Anyway, it was my wife who alerted me to this series and a quick look at the first two episodes of the second series found me looking up series one which she'd already watched and I have to say she wasn't wrong, as I found it absolutely hilarious.It reminded me of so many of my favourite sit-coms, like ""Father Ted"", naturally, ""Press Gang"" and yes, ""The I.T. Guys"", but it still has its own identity. Set in early 1990's Derry in Northern Ireland before the Good Friday Agreement came into place, it concerns the misadventures of a group of five young friends, four female and Irish, one male and English and by extension their eccentric families.It makes clever use of the political and religious backdrop for the comedy, the families in question being Roman Catholics living in the predominantly Protestant town of Derry, so that one episode has the hapless family attempting to head for a weekend in the country while an Orange Walk is in full swing, while another sees the young gang claim to have had holy visions in a chapel, with a statue of the Virgin Mary apparently ""smirking"" at them.The situations are amusingly set up, but it's the rapid-fire gags, often near-the-knuckle, which had me creasing myself as well as the individual characterisations themselves. I don't know who my favourite is amongst them but the central character of Erin, with her teenage crushes, literary pretensions and down-to-earth sensibilities probably shades it, although the hormonally imbalanced Michelle, uber-enthusiastic Clare and ditzy Orla and doormat James run her close and all get their share of the good lines on offer, not to mention their dysfunctional parents and grandparents too.All the episodes I've watched were of the same high standard with the only difficulty sometimes being the machine-gun-like Northern Irish delivery which can be a bit hard to pick up sometimes. That said I'm getting more than enough laughs from what I can see and hear so I'm not complaining too much.
To all those many millions more people currently watching the appallingly bad ""Mrs Brown's Boys"" do yourself a favour and switch to this immediately."
tt7120662,"Have now watched all three episodes and simply think its wonderful writing and acting . I served in Derry 83-84 and can assure all , the humour of this show is spot on as with the acting , trust me , iv P checked more people in Derry than I care to recall however there humour never ceased to amaze me , specially the young ladies . Great show and wonderful people portrayed in difficult times ."
tt7120662,"Sitcoms are about set up and execution. The derry girls have enough characters to have an endless amount of series. There isn't a real plot, or developmental story arc, there isn't a single lesson to learn or for the characters to learn, but watching these bold girls navigate teenage responsibilities is fun to watch. The adults are just as fun and interesting as their children. Most situations are based in reality, which makes this show even funnier. Everyone has met the derry girls in their own lives, or knows someone like them. I wish the episodes had more continuity, but the cause and effect set up doesn't disappoint."
tt7120662,"I have this on a constant loop, can't wait for the next season. Ignore the Erin bashers, she is brilliant and so is the writing and the rest of the cast. I've turned off the nightly news in place of Derry Girls and my outlook has actually gotten brighter, thanks girls (and the wee English fella.)"
tt7120662,"Season One: 6.5/10Season Two: 6.5/10Season Three: 7/10Themes: Comedy, Friendship, Northern Ireland, Religious Conflict, High School, Adults & Family.Top three characters: 1) Sister Michael, 2) Michelle Mallon and 3) Gerry Quinn."
tt7120662,I couldn't get past the fact that the teens look closer to 30 than 16. Erin and her cousin look to be the same age as Erin's mother. Michelle is a very entertaining character but she too looks older than many of the moms and teachers. Then there's the exaggerated facial expressions and painfully obvious sitcom plots. I really wanted to like this but gave up after the first season.
tt7120662,"I haven't laughed so much for any how of late as I have for this one. Saw this on Netflix and can't recommend it highly enough. I thought all the actors did a fantastic job. I especially liked Siobhan McSweeney who plays Sister Micheal. She's an absolute hoot and a real scene-stealer. Her deadpan dialogue delivery left me in splits. The script of this show is extremely witty. It really captures the angst and the indignation that the characters feel in the funniest way possible. I found myself remembering my ""rebel without a cause"" teenage days while watching this show. The principal cast - the four girls and James - share great chemistry and have done a fantastic job making sure the funny lines from the script really land. It's a pity this show only has 6 episodes. I liked it so much, I've seen it twice and really want more!"
tt7120662,"Being a non-Irish man in my 40s I'm clearly not in the key demographic, but I really enjoyed this show. It felt a bit too broad and farcical for my tastes in the beginning, but it got better. The acting is solid throughout. I watched the whole thing in two days and am looking forward to season 3."
tt7120662,"I'm a 52 yo Australian bloke and this is only the third review I've ever written. Initially I was scepticalabout a show about teenage girls from Derry, but a mate highly recommended it. To put it simply, this is one of the best series I've seen. The comedy is interlaced with some truly poignant observations and social commentary. Brilliant. Kudos to the Lady who wrote and created this masterpiece.Did I mention Brilliant?!"
tt7120662,"But this is #@%&* hilarious!
It's rare for any TV writing to surprise me with originality, and far rarer still for a ""comedy"" show to exhibit enough originality to catch me off guard, but this is a piece of abso-frecking-lute genius!
If you're from the UK of GB & NI, watch it; you'll laugh your @rse off. 
If not, give it a try, and google lots. to try to get where these absolutely brilliant characterisations come from.
I'm actually jealous that someone else wrote this brilliant work!"
tt7120662,"My family moved to Northern Ireland, in 1968, while my Father, who was in the US Air Force, was in Vietnam. This program revives much of the experience my sisters and I had in grammar school, there (albeit we were Protestants in County Down and a generation before)."
tt7120662,I've enjoyed it and would have enjoyed it more if Erin wasn't so annoying her facial expressions and the over the top acting is off putting.
tt7120662,"This was an absolute TREAT. I did not know what to expect when I started watching this but after 2 or 3 scenes, I knew I was gonna binge watch this.
I dont feel like The Troubles is a historical event that has been touched on very often in popular culture. That´s why I found it so refreshing to see it in a comedic way through the eyes of Derry teenagers.The writing was spot on, you could never tell what was going to happen or what someone was going to say. Everything was just surprisingly hilarious all the time. If you can overlook the fact that the actors who are playing the teenagers are around ten years older than they should be, then you´ll find their performances convincing. Some of them overacted sometimes (Erin´s character is a little unnatural) but since the whole show is a bit nutty it kind of works."
tt7120662,"I enjoyed watching this show and was sad when I finished season 2. The misadventures the main characters go through are hilarious to watch, the main character's family is fun to watch and relatable as well - I'm not even Irish ! While it's true that it can be over the top in some ways, like Erin's (the main character) constant face squirm and Claire's over the top breakdown in every episode. Little things like that become unfunny and old. Still, I can overlook that and honestly say that I love this show. I like the idea of setting it in a really turbulent time in the country's history and showing how even with the violence going on, these girls are still living out their teenage years as best as they can. I see other reviews bashing the show for following sitcom conventions and honestly, that says more about those user's over esteemed egos than the show. God forbid different genres follow similar conventions, could you imagine ? It's a great show and I highly recommend it."
tt7120662,"I'm a Sri Lankan 27-year old man, and after finding about Shaun of the dead and watching it, I became an UK comedy fan. The dark, sarcastic comedy style was right up my alley. US comedy can be too over-the-top, silly and too corny sometimes, in my opinion (As a man from a country with 0 movies in any recognized comedy list). I completed the trilogy then, and bunch of other UK movie classics after and then got into TV shows. Inbetweeners, IT crowd, Peep show are some of my favorites. And after searching for a show in the style of Inbetweeners, I found about this show - Derry Girls. And as a lover of the classic UK sitcoms, and as a avid comedy fan, I can genuinely say this is right up there with the classics, and as much hilarious as one of the best in the genre. Can't really relate to the culture or the style of behavior of the characters, but the comedy gold was not lost on an average south asian. We watch a lot of US shows & UK shows in Sri Lanka, but the accent was sometimes too hard to follow but the subtitles definitely helped. Inbetweeners is still my favorite of the two, maybe because it was somewhat relatable when it came to guys stuff. Still easily one of the best sitcom shows I have seen period, NOT ONLY from UK. If you are not from the UK, please keep the subtitles on, because some of the jokes can get missed due to how fast and nonchalant they deliver the lines (part of the UK style, I think). 10/10 Show, 10/10 comedy, 10/10 acting, 8/10 story, and 9/10 teenage drama. Sorry if my English was bad, this isn't my native language."
tt7120662,What am I missing? I forced myself to get through the first episode and it was painful. I didn't laugh once. I don't understand why people are giving it such great reviews.
tt7259746,"Not being too old when the original season aired, I was unfamiliar with the concept of this show, so when I saw all 8 episodes had been added to Netflix I had no idea what to expect. I was so pleasantly surprised.The show is life-affirming and emotional. Whilst at times the guys seem a little too intrusive and border on being overly judgemental, they win me, and the people they're there to help, over with their charm, friendship and emotional support. Their chemistry and friendship brings a smile to my face and really is magic. The way they allowed others and themselves to open up was a privilege to see, and I have come away from each episode with a smile on my face. Definitely worth a watch, the first episode with Tom had me beaming, sobbing and awwing. A true delight."
tt7259746,"As entertaining as the original was, the new version is even better - and it gets better with each season.Aside from the laugh out loud moments, and genuine warmth that permeates each episode, the overwhelming feeling that the viewer gets from the Fab Five (individually and collectively) is kindness.While many reality shows focus on the least appealing aspects of human nature, Queer Eye focuses on the best."
tt7259746,"The small handful of negative reviews I've read seem to take issue with Jonathan's flamboyancy, but a lot of these critics are self-proclaimed gay men who have a problem with ""negative gay stereotypes."" I'm here to tell you there is nothing innately negative about flamboyancy other than the fact that our society deemed all things associated with femininity as inferior. In other words, those reviewers are projecting their own self-hate and internalized homophobia onto this show, and their reviews reflects their own baggage, NOT the quality of the show. So what if Jonathan is a bit extra? If you can't learn to find him endearing, admire his unapologetic courage, or appreciate how he really rounds out the spectrum of masculinity displayed on the cast, you won't see how much of an essential part he is to the show's theme of acceptance in the diversity of people.That aside, the design transformations are aesthetically on point, incredibly tasteful and thoughtfully custom-tailored to the hero subjects. And, the best part is, the show has a lot of heart. It is uplifting and motivating--it transcends outer beauty as it promotes self-care, self-respect, self-confidence and self-worth, but also love and acceptance in a toxic culture. It's a feel-good without the escapism which makes for a cathartic viewing experience."
tt7259746,"Usually I research a lot before I watch a movie or a show, but I pick this show randomly. And I gotta say: this is the best thing I've watched in a LONG time. I've wondering why I was so blowed away by this (and I'm a straight guy) and I realise it's because it is real. Of course there are some unnatural scenes, like extrapolation or disconfort in front of the cameras, and whatever, but The Fab Five are not professional actors, they are themselves doing and living what they believe, and the guys chosen are real people, working their dreams and fears in between the scenes. I laughed, I wondered, I felt alive watching this (and I even cry). Wonderful job to everyone involved in the show. Thank you."
tt7259746,"I fell in love with this show and the 5 guys the very first episode. I cannot wait for the next season! Everything is on point; the sense of humour, the taste, the discussions, the characters and I love the respect for everyone involved. A really touching and entertaining show! Give it a try :)"
tt7259746,Everyone that has a negative opinion or thinking of the LGBT community...watch this. I'm a Christian and my Jesus never once told me to hate on gays. They are genuine and real...more than most ppl I know anyways!
tt7259746,"Considering how dark and bleak everything can seem at times, Queer Eye has such a true, heartwarming quality about it that is hard to come by. The inclusivity, diversity and the respect for all of it is amazing. The way this group reaches out to not only expand people's views on what, for an example, masculinity is and can be, but also to expand their own mindsets about things, is truly priceless. This is a show of diversity, kindness and spreading joy, and I love every bit of it.There's not a single episode that would've left me dry-eyed and there's not a single person I would not recommend this to. All in all, Queer Eye is 100% a show that is current and important, and definitely worth the watch."
tt7259746,"Jonathan Ness makes every gray or sad day shine bright like the sun. He alone is worth giving the show ten stars. But all five of this heart warming, kind, smart, handsome and caring guys make pure magic out if this show. Me and my ten year old daughter always watch this together, and we smile, cry, laugh, hug and cry again. We have been through a lot and this show is like medicine for our souls. THANK YOU!"
tt7259746,"The show is sweet, funny, charming, and the best part is the dialogue being had about race, religion and mutual respect, is what's most important. We loved it!"
tt7259746,The minute the show started it brought all the good memories I had with the previous show. I had so much fun watching it! The cast seems to get along great and they are all super fun and excited in helping these guys - despite what I read about ir here on making fun of them first. Guys tease each other all the time and at any moment they said mean things like fat or ugly... I bing watched it and I can't wait for season 2!!! P.S. I laughed so hard with Jonathan and the mattress scene! He is the new Carlson only a little bit more outrageous! loved it!
tt7259746,"Just like the original show, you guys are so kind! You just put a smile on my face! I am 65 years old and a straight white female. I have just fallen in love with the Fab 5."
tt7259746,"I quite enjoyed season one, but I had to give up in season two.My main issue is that it has become allllll about the hosts. An opportunity to get on their soapboxes and spout about themselves and whatever other topic crosses their way.The episode where they worked with a police officer was particularly uncomfortable for me as one of the hosts was almost putting their guest on trial. The original series had quirky charm and I don't remember it being so focused on the hosts' agendas.It should be sweep in, improve someone's life and move on. Inspire people and have fun doing it.As a gay guy I am sympathetic to some need to raise awareness and increase tolerance... but to me indulging the hosts and not focusing on the guests is the wrong way to do it."
tt7259746,"Some episodes are breezy casual fun and others are inspiring and sweet but it's just a bit too inauthentic, manufactured and forced for me.The friendship between the crew feels forced sometimes and some of the people being made over seemed like they're being forced into awkward or intimate moments.Yes, it's sweet and joyful but also kind of vapid and shallow. It's about objects, clothes and googled recipes, pretty wrapping paper over deep issues.Even though it's largely forced at least we get to see real everyday people, some with rich personalities, experiencing magic and their potential.If you're choosy about episodes and pick the more mellow few, it's okay."
tt7259746,"Please disregard the bad comments and watch just one episode, if you don't like it, switch to another series.As for me, it's inspirational, it tackled some of my issues and above it all, it made me feel much better. Definitely worth watching it!!!"
tt7259746,"Literally made an account for this show bc I'm so mad at all the negative comments about Jonathan. He has been on other creative platforms and this is just his personality. I for one love it and it brings so much light and humor to the show. And for the record saying ""I'm a gay man"" does not equal a free pass to be a judgemental asshole. This show is amazing. From the very first episode I was hooked. The guys they makeover are so sweet and touching. And they really do give them so much more than a makeover."
tt7259746,"I've never watched a show before that has made me cry, learn about the importance of beard grooming and made me want to believe in humanity again. That was until I watch Queer Eye. The critics are right in saying that this is what the world needs right now. From fashion tips to encouraging words from mature, wise, funny, amazing gay men, this is what we've all been waiting for.
I (almost) would like to describe this show as an ointment for sadness and tears. I watch an episode as often as possible because of the hope it gives me.
I have never rated a movie about an eight but this show deserves, earned, a ten!"
tt7259746,"Queer Eye to me, the first time I saw it I thought it was some sort of cheesy documentary but was I wrong. Queer Eye is such an inspirational show that takes 5 men of the LGBT community who have a mission to help change other men's lives. The show has a good blend of inspiration and comedy at the same time as the guys have a very upbeat and happy personality. Now would I say some of it is kinda stupid? yes. But, stupid can be good right? And in this case it sure is. I would say out of all netflix original series, this would be on my top 5 no doubt. If you need a show with a lot of heart and comedy, Queer Eye is for sure one to watch."
tt7259746,"I had no interest in seeing the revamped version of Queer Eye which I assumed would be more of the same, and I see enough snarkiness on Twitter. Of course I was dead wrong as my huge fan daughter showed me. The warmth, love and respect the Fab Five show the weekly subject is life-affirming. I know that editing is showing me what it wants me to see but it apparently wants to show good people doing good things with joy and acceptance while allowing the very diverse group of guests learn to love themselves. Colorful, funny, kind and great design and clothing advice - what's not to like?"
tt7259746,"I am not gay and I love this show. It has it all. It's light, funny, drama, If you tried hard enough you could find something you like about the show, I love the makeovers and the way these guys talk to people. It's just amazing. Forget the negative reviews on this show and watch it for yourself."
tt7259746,"I was referred to this show by an individual very important to me and was deeply surprised by how much I loved it. There is such a therapeutic aspect to the show and it talks about important modern world issues such as racism, gun control and of course homophobia.Each member of the Fab Five is amazing because each one is able to have deep, meaningful conversations with someone they are attempting to help. The Fab Five have experienced addiction, homelessness and horrible pressures from their families. The show gives me so much hope that there are actually human beings who can be kind and care for others in a sincere way.I thought I would hate the show, but I always feel lighter after watching it. I highly suggest that you try it out. Please watch it!!!"
tt7259746,"What I find absolutely astounding upon reading the reviews for Queer Eye are the homophobic comments made by gay men! This has shocked me somewhat. Yes you CAN be homophobic if you're gay it seems. This show focuses a lot on bullying and it's rife in these comments against a particular cast member (whom I absolutely adore). I feel sick knowing in 2022 a community doesn't have one another's backs and is being critical towards members of their own community. You should be ashamed of yourselves. This show isn't for you. It's for accepting, understanding, warm and empathic people who are willing to accept people for who they are.This show is a ten for me! Love it!"
tt7259746,"For a show that aims to teach compassion, it sure condones the opposite toward animals.It glorifies the exploitation of animals in almost every episode. Boiling the crabs alive was also quite disturbing. Most cooking recommendations state not do this anymore, since scientists have demonstrated that crabs suffer, and it is completely unnecessary.This show has a long way to go to be progressive. They need to practice what they preach and learn about the intersection of different systems of violence and oppression."
tt7259746,"This new series just does not nearly hold a candle to the original series. That's not to say I do not like it, but it's just not nearly as good.I did not get a chance to watch this series when it originally aired, because I was so far in the closet that I was in Narnia. Having being stuck in hospital, and after bringing this new series, I thought I'd binge the original Queer Eye.The original Fab 5 were mostly professionals (except Jai), who thoroughly understood their skills prior to the series. Thom is, hands down, one of the best interior designers I've ever witnessed. And do not even get me started on the comparisons of Antoni v. Ted... My wife is a former chef, and her frustration in Antoni is just... Jonathan van Ness is, I suppose, an intent to replace Carson, but there are massive differences between the two. Carson is an outstanding stylist, who really knew what he was doing, while adding a bit of femme flaire and quick-witted hilarity. Van Ness tries to also bring that flaire, but at the level of a nine-year-old. He's just not funny. And he just constantly seems to scream for attention. I adore Carson - van Ness, not so much. Now, I did say Jai maybe was not on the level of the others, but he still did a fantastic job as ""culture guru"".Perhaps my biggest disappointment in the new Fab 5 is that they try to completely change their ""clients"" style, whereas the original Fab 5 were set on just updating their style. I don't get this sense that the new Fab 5 know what they're doing, nor even care about the people they are supposed to help. In fact, it seems to me like they care more about dancing, etc. in front of the camera.I also do not get the sense that these guys are even close to each other like the original were. The original still keep in regular contact. Carson and Thom even had their own series a couple of years ago.The only positives I take away that the new series is a) more inclusive, and b) Tan (he's awesome)."
tt7259746,This show is amazing. Never seen a show so positive and endearing. I could watch a million episodes and never get tired of it
tt6077448,"Not an Indian but am completely hooked. Better watching this in Indian with subtitles than the English dub. Great story, great actors and the way they finished the season, just when it starts getting more interesting makes me mad because I've got to wait how long until the next season haha."
tt6077448,"First of all, if you're not from India, please do not watch the dubbed version, it's not necessary at all. Subtitles will do fine, and the unfamiliar tones of languages spoken in India only add to the amazing feeling of the show. I've heard people say the show is confusing and they couldn't follow the plot - try a little harder. Map out the characters if you must, replay a scene if you didn't understand. Most likely you were unable to understand because (sadly) western people are not used to Indian names or faces: it takes a little more effort to remember who is who. Take that effort. It's more than worth it. After a few episodes, I had no trouble following the storyline. I hope Netflix will create more shows from places all over the world, and that in time, this won't be an issue anymore. Some reviewers say Sacred Games can't be compared to Narcos. I think it can. Enough twists and turns, just the right amount of violence, engaging, political, touching... Characters are not good or bad, they're in between, and you're not sure whether to love or hate them. I truly cared about some of them, which I can't really say about the characters of Narcos. Gaitonde is a man who killed more people than you can believe, but the show still makes you love him, all credit going to the great actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui.I didn't rate it a 10/10 for three reasons:
I did not always find Anjali Mathur's performance convincingKukoo's story was dragged out too long in my opinionThe final episode seemed rushed, although I'm glad they gave us somewhat of an answer"
tt6077448,"This is first Indian netflix original series directed by Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwani.The second season was a bigger disappointment than what I'm to my parents. Well, jokes apart, S02 was not as bad but S01 actually raised the bar so high that matching upto that level was never going to be easy. They just made the Gaitonde's character a mere joke. Guruji's character doesn't have the potential that we expected. The more they digged into other characters, more cartoonish they looked except Zoya, Malcolm and Jojo's character. They kept an open ending in S02 also but I hope they better come with a killer script else...
First 30 seconds in the first episode and you'll get to know that this series is going to be dark, edgy and controversial. This series starts with bold statements on religion, and then continues with same on political figures like Rajiv Gandhi to a lot of cuss words, violence and drug use. If you're a person who gets offended very easily then I advise you to keep yourself away form it.
Sacred Games is just an example of what Anurag Kashyap is capable of. This is his real potential. Now screw CBFC. I maybe am a bit biased towards Anurag Kashyap or Phantom productions in general.The whole cast did a great job, while we saw Saif Ali Khan in a good role after Omkara and Being Cyrus. Radhika Apte has a quite short but impressive role. In my opinion Neeraj Kabi, Jatin Sarna and Nawazuddin are the backbone of the series."
tt6077448,"With a solid start to the drama,with every episode makes you heart beat faster. The rawness of the drama is surreal and gets you hooked. Every episode leaves you with a question unanswered? and doesn't answer them till the very last. Great acting by the whole cast.Not only do the ""star"" actors shine but the an amazing supporting cast make keeps you engaged.Lastly, Dont watch the first episode if you have your exam the next day or i promise you you will be locked in your room for 8 hours straight."
tt6077448,"First of all, hats off Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditay Motwane, how did you manage to put this together is an amazing feat. I am saying this because they both have directed the show but for different characters (Anurag for Nawaz Storyline and Vikram for Saif's). The performances are amazing and Varun Grover deserves all the applause for writing down street smart dialogues. With every character having a grey role in the show, all the characters have layers of sketch going into it. Eagerly waiting for Season 2!"
tt6077448,"Having fallen in love with the book 10 years ago, I had a lot of reservations of how its screen adaptation would be. In the book, Vikram chandra had explored each character in so much depth with different layers that to make a 3 hour Bollywood Flick would have been foremost a daunting task and secondary an injustice to the plot.Enter, Netflix. Having changed the Tele scene world over, no other production house would be more suited and daring than Netflix to take this Plot head on and do justice to it. And no other duo of Directors than Anurag Kashyap and Vikram Motwane to direct it with such finesse, style and daring.The series is gripping, fascinating, dark, thought-provoking, chilling and so much more. It is also very relevant in today's India with its tense social and religious under-current. Every actor is top-notch. The role is Bread & Butter for Nawazuddin Siddiqui and he owns every scene he is in. How badly I wanted Saif Ali Khan to prove himself once more after 'Langda Tyagi'. He is not only superb but you feel the amount of efforts he has put in the role. Also the actor playing 'Bunty Sharma' is the best among all the sub-characters.The series is truly Binge-worthy and shows what can be achieved without the CBFC 'Big Brother' role. I am however quite sceptic of how it would be received by majority of the Indian audience who have been spoiled with mushy romantic genres and action for them is a muscular middle aged guy beating up 30 under-fed rowdies. I sincerely hope that this series results in a commercial success for all involved so that we can get to see more and more epic like this from our filmmakers."
tt6077448,"People who doesn't understand they are giving it low ratings because when you see it clearly, 1st season has all the questions and 2nd season have all the answers, 2nd season is the answers for the people who are saying that Sacred Games is getting success because of abusive words and nudity, it can go beyond of your mind, complexity of script and small open secrets hiding nowhere but in front of your eyes. Over the top performances, well written and well directed."
tt6077448,"With this show Netflix has really changed the game of television and storytelling in India. Bollywood now really has to step up and stop making brain dead movies just for commercial success. It is directed by Anurag Kashyap and Vikram Aditya Motwane and trust me there are no other directors in Bollywood who could have done justice to this show. It has that same rawness, realism and intricate storytelling like Gangs of Wasseypur and Dev D by Kashyap and Motwane.Acting is suberb and top notch by a great ensemble cast with Nawazuddin channeling his Faizal Khan from Wasseypur with more emotional layers to it. Radhika apte, Saif Ali Khan, Neeraj Kabi, Jitendra Singh also delivers strong performances. Kubra Sait delivers a heart warming breakout performance like never seen before.This is a must watch for anybody who likes watching stories that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Also must watch just to see how Mumbai becomes a character in a story like none other told before. Really can't wait for the next season. Need it like yesterday.10/10"
tt6077448,The series and actors are good but I sometimes can't make sense of it and wonder if there are poor translations from Hindi to English. It may be due to my lack of understanding the religious connotations but often the dialogue just doesn't make much sense. Interesting premise.
tt6077448,I watched the whole season 2 and finished all 8 episodes in 7 hours. Unfortunately it does not live up to the expectations.The maker main focus was on profanity rather than the storyline.Its a deliberate effort of stretching the series.
tt6077448,"At the time of writing, this show has an average rating of 9.1, making it grossly over-rated compared to other TV series and Netflix shows. I would say a fair reflection of its quality compared to other international shows is 7.5 to 8 max. I've only given it 5 stars to lower the average but I would probably give it 8 as 7.5 is not an option!I'm not very familiar with other Indian TV series but this seems to break new ground in a number of ways including its depiction of religion and sex. I enjoyed it but it never made me stay up all night binge watching as I have with numerous other TV series.I watched over half of it in the default UK audio setting which is (dubbed) English and found the differences in the dubbing and subtitle translations to be amusing but also distracting. It was much better when I switched to the native Hindi dialogue with subtitles."
tt6077448,"First of All congratulations to Anurag and Vikram,I have always loved their work.It is an excellent start to original netflix content in India.
Opening scene is enough to show you that this is not your typical Indian show. Nawab and Saif are excellent in the show,but I felt Radhika's character was underdeveloped.
Cinematography and those long shots bring alive the MUMBAI (an important character in the show).Gaitonde identity and 25 days threat makes it excellent thriller. 
I loved this season, can not wait for season 2."
tt6077448,One of the finest actor in Marathi Film Industry grabbing the opportunity .Amazing Performance Saheb !
tt6077448,"Sacred Games is definitely one of the best thriller shows that I have seen. This is no ordinary story of a cop and a gangster, it has a twist.The show is very well written and the screenplay is amazing too . 
It truly lives up to its title Sacred 'Games' as the episodes are in themselves a type of puzzle each with a different name and a symbol that the viewer is trying to solve since the very first episode. 
Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Saif Ali Khan and Radhika Apte have done an exemplary job . The title song truly adds life to the show as it gives a sense of mystery to the viewer. I also really like how the show has this amazing narrative and the flashbacks of the 20th century Bombay .
It's definitely a must watch for anyone who loves a great story!"
tt6077448,"A masterpiece truly. Congratulations to Netflix and India on this amazing Drama Series. Based on the book by Vikram Chandra, this show slowly reveals it's dark secrets just like reading the book. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is truly a gem and his portrayal of Gaitonde is bang on. Saif and Radhika have done justice to their roles but it was Siddiqui who stole the spotlight. Finally a TV series to be proud of. There are some really great dialogues which I will not disclose so you should watch it for yourself. The depiction of Bombay is such that it feels like it's a character in itself. Dark, mysterious and thrilling!
A must watch."
tt6077448,"Finally , 10 thousand times better than sass bahu serial , 
Baap of crime patrol"
tt6077448,"I liked how the story began. This isn't a slow narrative, you basically have to run with the characters to catch up with their mind and emotions and sometimes have to see between the frames. I live on the extreme ends of storytelling arch. I love the slow narrative where each and everything is described in such a manner that you feel you are in that situation and you start feeling what the character feels and then there is the impromptu situation where you are unexpectedly put in and you have to start catching up with why the characters are doing what they are doing. Both are fun ways to sit back and enjoy a show. Sacred Games falls under the latter category.
Ganesh Gaitonde is that don who has only one purpose and that is to be the city he lives in - Bombay. The show takes us through his journey from Trimbakeshwar to Bombay and how as an adult after pedaling in drugs he decides by and by that he is meant for much more than that. He dreams big and he sets his ambition into action. We see ruthlessness in him which is a pre requisite of being a don but at the same time we see him trying to make his gang walk the secular line so as not to have religion come into play. You and I and that is if you were born in the 80's will nod your head at the narrative of the story when scenes of unrest are shown in the post Indira Gandhi era that has left the nation broken and at the same time has become that ""gap"" that Politicians use as their mosh pits come election season.Gaitonde claims he has three fathers and tells us about each one and how they influenced his life and made him who he is.
Then we have Sartaj, the Sikh inspector who is trying really hard to battle the internal corruption in police services by refusing to give a false statement in court. His refusal becomes leverage for his superior who dangles his refusal as bait at every opportunity that Sartaj needs back up or when he works on a lead.
Sartaj has his own emotional baggage. His wife has left him and he hasn't gotten over her. This I presume is what leads him to consume anxiety pills. We see a little bit of emotional instability in him but not so much that we question his judgment as he pursues his cop instincts.
Anjali Mathur, the RAW agent who wants to step out into the field and not just stay behind her desk. She, like Sartaj, follows her instincts and teams up with Sartaj to save the city. Except she believes there is more to the story than just a gang war. Of course she is stopped from acting on her hunch and evidence because hey she's a girl and girls can't go out and play after sundown. Like Sartaj she also has her own reasons for being who she is and that is what propels her into going forward to uncover the roles of different people in the story.
Kookoo, I think was a metaphor for the city itself and whoever had Kookoo had Bombay. That's all that I'll be saying about this character.These are the primary characters and these characters all have very obvious roles to play and are definitely the leads but for me it was the secondary actors who did all the work in making me hate and love the plot.
Kanta Bai, who is so freaking stoic even when there is chaos around her and even when things are going bad she is just there strong as a pillar and not scared of Gaitonde. Probably because she is more like a mother to him, after all it's all thanks to her that he gets his first break.
Katekar, is that constable who is at Sartaj's beck and call. Even though he represents the constable in the series he is also doing the added job of being the common man's voice when he is expressing his opinions as a person. Most of us have skewed perspectives based on the news and political speeches we are fed.
Malcolm Murad, was a decently surprising character. I liked him in entirety except in one place when he did something out of character.
DCP Parulkar's character has been portrayed so well! He makes you hate him. He makes you want to plough through his body with a rain of bullets. I like it when actors actually make you believe they are really that bad.The dialogues are amazing, even the ones making a jibe at political situations. Don't know who Shah Bano is? Google her. I like how one-liners were used to tell months' worth of tense situations in the country.But is this the best story ever told? No. Was the story predictable? Yes. Were we told anything different with this story? No. So what exactly is the show's USP? Acting!"
tt6077448,"The first original Indian series from Netflix; had a lot of expectations. I can safely say that most were adequately met, even exceeded. While admittedly the story has nothing new to offer, this Bombay gangster series is stylishly shot and executed with finesse. Bombay becomes a character in the series and the chasm between the classes which is so in-your-face in Bombay is captured beautifully. All major cities have class differences but none of them are as stark and apparent as they in Bombay. I was also happy to see it called by its old name of ""Bombay"" in English and ""Bambai"" in Hindi -felt authentic. The story itself is a cat and mouse game involving a variety of characters - mob bosses, religious figures, a gender-neutral character, corrupt cops, the inevitable honest cop, a female cop from a central police agency. While stereotypes are rift, there some funny touches. The nick names given by the female CBI officer to store numbers on her cell is an example as is the track of the police constable trying to get an intimate moment with his nagging wife. The ending leaves plenty of scope for a sequel - I do not wish to get into spoilers but what is a thoroughly satisfying series seems subject to an abrupt end. Saif Ali Khan is top notch and quite unlike an Indian hero for he keeps getting beaten up with alarming regularity but his character is the moral compass of the show. Nawazuddin predictably owns every scene he is in - it is an extension of his character from Gangs of Wasseypur. How you miss Manoj Bajpai though. A great thing about Anurag Kashyap is that he is able to find character actors who leave such a strong impression on the screen. And ""Sacred Games"" is no different.
All the character actors are uniformly excellent. I tried listening to the track in English and it is atrocious. Not only does it take away from the authenticity of the proceedings, it is also badly dubbed. Imagine watching Narcos in English. Whoever took a decision to add a dubbed English track needs to given some counseling. If you want a better experience, watch the show in Hindi with English sub-titles. Vikram Chandra's novel ""Sacred Games"" was a critically acclaimed book, but it was a commercial failure. The writers have done a good job salvaging what is a middling novel at best. How I wish these same writers would employ their considerable skill to a nice World War era Indian thriller.I look forward to more original Netflix Indian series soon."
tt6077448,"Sacred Games is my first ever web series i ever watched. I must say this series is best web series ever made in India.Season-1Sacred Games is a gritty, neo-noir crime drama that delves deep into the complexities of Mumbai, its underworld, and the blurred lines between power, religion, and morality. The series, adapted from Vikram Chandra's novel, is a masterclass in storytelling, featuring compelling characters, a gripping plot, and stunning visuals.The narrative is split between two primary characters: Ganesh Gaitonde, a ruthless gangster on the brink of death, and Sartaj Singh, a disillusioned police officer.Nawazuddin Siddiqui delivers a career-defining performance as the enigmatic gangster, Ganesh Gaitonde. His transformation from a small-time crook to a ruthless kingpin is both terrifying and fascinating. The flashbacks into Gaitonde's past, particularly his relationship with his mentor Suleiman Isa and the tragic death of his wife, provide crucial context for his character's motivations.Saif Ali Khan's portrayal of Sartaj Singh, the seemingly ordinary cop, is equally compelling. His journey from disillusionment to a determined pursuit of the truth is gradual yet impactful. The revelation of his Muslim heritage and the prophecy he receives set the stage for a compelling character arc.Beyond the crime thriller genre, Sacred Games tackles profound themes of religion, politics, and the socio-economic divide in India. The series doesn't shy away from exploring the darker aspects of society, shedding light on issues such as corruption, terrorism, and the impact of organized crime.The cinematography of Sacred Games is a character in itself. The lens captures the city's duality with remarkable precision: the vibrant chaos of its streets and the dark, brooding undercurrents that lurk beneath. The use of color is particularly striking, with the neon-lit nights contrasting sharply with the dusty, sun-baked days. The camera work is often handheld, lending a raw, documentary-like feel to the proceedings, heightening the sense of realism. From the sprawling slums of Dharavi to the opulent residences of the elite, the series paints a vivid picture of Mumbai's socio-economic divide. The city's architecture, both old and new, is used to great effect, serving as a visual metaphor for the characters and their worldviews.The music in Sacred Games is an integral part of the storytelling. The background score, composed by Alokananda Dasgupta and Yashraj Jaiswal, is a haunting blend of electronic and orchestral elements that perfectly captures the show's dark and brooding atmosphere. The use of percussive instruments, particularly the tabla, adds a raw, primal energy to the soundtrack. The music is often used to underscore the psychological turmoil of the characters, heightening the tension and suspense. The inclusion of contemporary Indian music, such as the songs by Divine, adds a layer of authenticity and modernity to the show.While the series is undoubtedly compelling, it does have its flaws. Some viewers might find the pacing uneven, with certain plot points dragging. Additionally, the show's exploration of complex themes can be overwhelming at times.Despite its few shortcomings, Sacred Games is a groundbreaking series that raised the bar for Indian television. It's a show that demands your attention, keeps you guessing, and leaves you wanting more. If you're a fan of crime dramas with a social commentary, this series is a must-watch.Season-2Sacred Games Season 2 attempts to expand upon the intricate web of crime, politics, and spirituality established in its predecessor. While it maintains the series' signature style, it struggles to match the intensity and impact of the first season.The second season dives deeper into the enigmatic world of Guruji, played by Pankaj Tripathi. His character, while intriguing, often overshadows the core narrative. The introduction of new characters like Jojo and Bunty adds layers of complexity but also dilutes the focus on the main plot.Nawazuddin Siddiqui's Gaitonde remains a captivating anti-hero, but his character arc feels somewhat stagnant. Saif Ali Khan's Sartaj Singh undergoes a transformation, evolving into a more proactive role, but his character lacks the depth and complexity of the first season.Unlike the tightly wound narrative of Season 1, Season 2 often feels scattered, with multiple subplots competing for attention. The pacing is uneven, with some episodes dragging while others rush through crucial plot points. The climax, while visually striking, lacks the emotional impact of the first season's finale.The ending of Sacred Games Season 2 was undoubtedly controversial. It was a bold, open-ended conclusion that left viewers divided. On one hand, it was a departure from the traditional narrative structure, forcing the audience to become active participants in the story's outcome. The final scene, with Sartaj facing the daunting task of disarming a nuclear bomb, was a high-stakes cliffhanger that left a lasting impact. However, critics argued that the ending was rushed and unsatisfying.Despite its narrative shortcomings, Season 2 is visually stunning. The cinematography continues to capture the essence of Mumbai, both its grandeur and its underbelly. The action sequences are well-executed, and the overall production value remains high.Sacred Games Season 2 is a mixed bag. While it offers glimpses of the brilliance seen in the first season, it ultimately falls short of expectations. The series attempts to tackle ambitious themes but struggles to maintain a cohesive narrative. It's a show that promises much but delivers less.Overall, both seasons of ""Scared Games"" deliver compelling narratives filled with suspense, psychological depth, and thriller. While Season 1 establishes the foundation, Season 2 expands upon it, creating an unforgettable viewing experience."
tt6077448,"When we look to current TV serials shown in India, it is far better. Best thing I like about Kashyap's direction is that I believe he used to spend 50% of his overall budget on hiring good gali galuch dialog writers :). In fact I would like to say that writer used his P*e*i*s instead of pen with a inspiring person showing his a*s*s whole time to push creativity to next level.Overall it's a good to watch for a Bollywood or Indian TV serial watcher. Every one from actor to directors have placed their best with a good story line and narration makes it worth watching.However if you have already watch series like Narcos or equivalent, you may find this too slow with Bollywood types slow motion introduced across direction of this serial.Finally in era of 2014 onwards everyone seems to screwing congress from back and dialogs like changing Prime minister at the rate of changing underwear was hilarious , my best to this dialog writer. Overall it's worth watching and my best to Kashyap."
tt6077448,Season 2 just did not make any sense. And the ending was just painfully unsatisfying. Seems like the writers for this season were on same drugs as characters.
tt6077448,Amazingly directed and extraordinary performances. Classic Anurag Kashyap and Nawazuddin combo. Saif Ali khan and Radhika Apte were great too.
tt6077448,Season 2 has blown me away .Anuraag Kashyap and Nawazuddin Siddiqui are a formidable stellar pair . Nawaz fits beautifully into Ganesh Gaitonde and delivers his dialogues beautifully. The show is mesmerizing. It has a great atmosphere and feel. Every frame is different and beautifully shot.
tt6077448,"I just can't wait for the finale of this series , hats off to Anurag , Gaitonde , Bunty & Kukkoo . Loved every bit of it ."
tt8139862,This is great. So much better than the other pansy late night show hosts
tt8139862,"Interesting, hilarious, mostly great guests, perhaps with the exception of Fonda and Letterman. There's not a lot a lot to say about it. It's basically just like a podcast, and that's great, because it is all about the discussion."
tt8139862,"Norm is at his best. Before you judge Adam Eget, please watch his old Norm MacDonald Live spots...Adam is doing exactly what Norm wants him to do. Norm interrupts and has horrible (or genius?) segues between topics which is his trademark. That's what makes it different and funny. Even when he interrupts, the guests love him. I only hope he gets Gilbert Gotfried on ASAP."
tt8139862,"Norm is so authentic and natural that he brings out the humanity of his guests better than any other talk show host. Although the show is heavy with irony, irreverence, and hilarious non sequiturs, there remains a genuine warmth between Norm and his guests (and to a lesser extent his sidekick Adam Egret, who masterfully plays the role of the good-natured inflatable clown punching bag). You can tell Norm's guests truly like him and some even revere him for his incomprehensible comedic genius.Unfortunately, like all geniuses, Norm is often misunderstood. Many can't make sense of him because, like a force of nature, he is unpredictable, and is often indifferent to politically correct pieties. This is refreshing to most honest souls, but is anathema to the puritanical ideologues who currently dominate the media. For this reason, Norm will likely never have mass appeal. For the same reason, he is a true artist with integrity whose legacy will outlive most of his peers.For those not familiar with Norm's humor and personality, the show may be somewhat puzzling at first. I urge you to stick with it. He grows on you, and you feel yourself and your own humor growing along the way."
tt8139862,"I know that not everyone gets Norm. If you don't get him this is a show that you should avoid at all costs. That's fine. To me, Norm is the finest comedian alive today and his uniquely weird, warm personality adds immeasurably to his appeal.I found myself watching every episode with a sappy, happy grin on my face interspersed with bouts of laughing out loud. Norm effortlessly charms guests he didn't know well, like Jane Fonda, Drew Barrymore, Michael Keaton, Judge Judy and M. Night Shyamalan. For friends and colleagues like David Spade, David Letterman, Chevy Chase and Lorne Michaels there is lots of entertainment to be derived from their pointed teasing and joking around. The episode with Billy Joe Shaver, one of Norm's best friends, is just delightful.A must see for fans of Norm."
tt8139862,3 episodes in and I'm so glad they captured the same feeling that Norm Macdonald Live had. I really hope a second season is ordered because I'll keep Netflix with commercials if it means more Norm.
tt8139862,One of the few shows where you can't take your eyes off the screen. A great continuation from Norm MacDonald Live this sadly shorter versions leaves you wanting more and wishing each guest had more time. Norm seems in a genuine way to be able to connect not just with comedians but all his guests. With only 10 shows in the can I am going to need more Norm soon
tt8139862,"This show is better than most interview shows out there right now. It's kind of like a choose your own adventure interview for the guests. Norm allows them to be as serious and/or as silly as they want by asking good questions and injecting comedy throughout. It also has great production value. My only complaint is that the jokes segment at the end could be a tad bit longer. (To be honest, I wish each episode were longer.) Norm is a very knowledgeable guy and adds a lot of depth to each interview."
tt8139862,Continuing the same formula as his podcast with a shorter runtime and a little tighter. I noticed in the credits David Letterman consultation. I'm really enjoying this so far and hope Netflix don't wuss out on a show that doesn't pander for general appeal though does have great unique content.I hope the voice of the fans is enough to keep this going as Norm has plenty.
tt8139862,"I've only liked Norm MacDonald since I saw Hitler's Dog and though it was the funniest stand up I've ever seen. It was random but I loved it. When I first started watching his interview with David Spade I didn't know what to think. It was so bare bones, no music, no laugh track, nothing. And I thought it sucked basically. But after awhile it started to make me laugh quite a bit. I then looked up some reviews online and I really think that the reviewers missed the mark. I think it was the New Yorker I might be wrong but they I think misinterpreted David Spades entire interview they made it sound like he hated being there. As far as I can tell Spade and MacDonald know each other pretty well I don't think there was any misinterpretation at all. And Spade got funnier as the interview went in and at the end of it I was really enjoying the show. It's very different from what we are all used to, like I said, very bare bones, but when you get past that it actually is pretty funny. I'm only about half way through the Barrymore episode and they seem to have hit their stride. I'm gonna watch the rest of them and see how it goes, but so far it seems pretty good. If you liked Hitler's Dog you should give it a shot, it's way off the beaten path but Norm is pretty funny in the way he doesn't seem to ever know what's going on. It could be an act but damn he really sells it if it is"
tt8139862,"I have always been a fan of Norm - stand-up, SNL, sitcoms, David Letterman and Howard Stern appearances, sports show host... But I think this is the best. He is good at adjusting his style to the guest. The first episode with David Spade seemed pretty loose, like just a group of guys laughing it up in his basement. He was great with Drew Barrymore, who I also love, and then I was surprised to see Judge Judy and Jane Fonda as guests. He was so respectful to them, and seemed to know exactly how far he could go with his jokes.
I also like how his sidekick Adam Egret does not jump in and interrupt, like some talk show sidekicks.
He doesn't have a studio audience to tell you when you should be laughing, so when they are funny, they are actually funny. But, the interviews are actually pretty interesting, too. They talk about things that I think people actually want to know about, that the guests dare not talk about on a regular network talk show.
Keep it up, Norm. You're doing just fine."
tt8139862,This is the neutered version of Norm MacDonald Live. I love Norm and I loved NML but this show is lame. I really hope the second season is funny because the first season suuuuucked.
tt8139862,"Yeah....Norm is a fun guy... but, I agree with the others who said that he barely allows his guests to speak. It's strange that this is rated so highly...the David Spade one, David continuously attempted to say jokes, to say things and Norm just steam rolls over him. Based on everyone else's reviews, I am sure this will be marked as ""unhelpful."" Which will confuse me since what I am saying is true... anyway. Letterman's Netflix special was better and so are Fallon, Conan and Kimmel. Norm ought to take a page from them."
tt8139862,"Been watching since the beginning and I'm so thrilled Netflix picked him up.. I binged all episodes today, perfect 10 show!! Great interview, interactions, and most important JOKES!!!!"
tt8139862,It's so refreshing to watch a show where funny people can have unscripted and unfiltered conversations with each other. My only complaint is that the episodes aren't long enough!
tt8139862,"I am Norm MacDonald Live fan but this is different.
Guests are great and maybe more interesting than in Live.
Norm is funnier than ever.
Biggest difference from Live is that Norm has cleaned his act and became more funny (because of shorter format probably).
In last few days read reviews and apologies of apologies of apologies and twits and watched and listened interviews, podcasts, radio shows but there is nothing of that here. 
I guarantee that bad reviews were about his non PC comedy from Live and not from this Show. Sometimes I actually doubt that reviewers watched this Show.
'm so happy for Norm. 
His ""straight"" performance is so much better than I expected."
tt8139862,"As a fan of Norm, I expected it to be funny , not this charming. It is like a warm bath. Both lovely and refreshing. Cant wait for the second season!"
tt8139862,"If you're someone who likes irreverence or non-sequitur humor you probably already like Norm.Norm is deceptively intelligent, even if he pretends otherwise and you can see he is having fun.The show is similar to the podcast but more streamlined. Don't get the long Norm Macdonald story jokes, but the attitude is the same. Adam Eget is there to be abused, but I think he is a component.For those who love political comedy ir don't abide adhd, non-sequitur, or ironic humor, you probably won't like this, but the again, you probably already know you don't like Norm.I am certainly biased, as Norm has been brilliant to me since the mid 90s when I watched SNL mostly for his Weeken Update.One thing I think Norm has added to his repertoire over the years is his deceptive charm, which can be seen in the Drew Barrymore and Jane Fonda interviews especially"
tt8139862,"Great interviews from a funny, goofy and sometimes wistful Norm Macdonald. Like all interview shows, it really depends on how interesting you find the guests, but the loose, informal format helps keep everything entertaining. I can't recommend it enough. Quit dickin' around on the internet and go watch it!"
tt8139862,"This show has a great tone to it, as a longtime fan of Norm I'm happy to have something on Netflix I can rewatch."
tt8139862,"A couple of episodes are good. The others are okay. The garbage jokes bit at the end does not work. They are not stupid-funny, just not funny. It is something that the audience simply must endure.For the record, Norm's sidekick has one trait that explodes on the screen when asking Judge Judy a question about her book on stupid people. It is something that you can't make up for by wearing three-piece suits. In the history of television, there is no other talk show sidekick that can touch the guy in this singular area."
tt8139862,"There are pure comedy gems in each of the episodes.
A much needed breath of fresh air in the netflix comedy collection!!!"
tt8139862,"It took me a few episodes to realize that it really isn't a comedy. Norm Macdonald is one of the funniest stand-up comedians I've ever seen. I love watching his appearances on talk shows like Conan and Fallon. I also really enjoyed the Norm Macdonald Live show. If you're a person who likes all of those things. and think that you will like this show just because it is Norm, well you will be disappointed. This is not Norm in his element--telling jokes, with satisfying punchlines and such. This is a talk show. Period. I would say that this would only be enjoyable for someone who really likes the guest. If you are lukewarm on the guests, I would say that you would probably not like this show. It is not very funny at all. If you are expecting jokes, well there are 3 jokes every episode. Ones that are written on note-cards. Norm reads one, Adam reads one, and the guest reads one. Those are pretty much the only jokes in the entire program. So, since this is not a comedy, as it is not funny. I have to then grade this show based on how good of a talk-show host Norm is. And, well he is not a very good host. He frequently interrupts his guests, which would be funny if this is a comedy, but as I established, I don't think it is. Therefore, interrupting is very awkward in this context. Furthermore, his co-host Adam is basically worthless. He literally just sits there and laughs. The only time that he ever speaks is when he is prodded for a question by Norm. Which, overall, creates a pretty awkward atmosphere. Ultimately, as much as I like Norm, I have to give this a pretty negative review. The show fails as a comedy, and then fails on the talk show aspect. The only way I would recommend this show, is if you really like the guest that is on--because some of the guests give some interesting stories. But, overall, I was disappointed."
tt8139862,"That about sums it up. No real flow, very hard to follow, the interviews do not go anywhere."
tt8289930,"As a female who has never even held a drivers licence I doubt greatly that I am the F1's target market but for the 2019 that's going to change. This doco series puts a personality into the sport that I often just assumed was bland & full of thugs. Utterly fascinating, it also does (in my opinion) an excellent job of explaining the rivalries between the different company factions. Really hope there will be a season 2."
tt8289930,"The most dramatic season in F1 in years and Netflix screwed it up (somewhat). The false commentary throughout annoyed me then just pissed me off! False razzmatazz of what qualifying day is about was just nonsense. There was signs of the original insight you got from the first three brilliant seasons but this just became more and more of a promotional series for the FIA. Some episodes to the same high standards, others just staged and orchestrated.Lando Norris has even complained on Twitter that the editing has painted incorrect pictures of him and Ricciardo by adding remarks made from one race into another to hype it up. That's just poor."
tt8289930,"Captures all the stuff just outside the headlines of the sport, and goes behind the scenes better than anyone before.Especially interesting to get close to many of the ""smaller"" drivers, as most of us already know all there is to know about Hamilton, Vettel, etc.If you like the NFL Network Gameday productions, you will like this as well - provided you like racing ofcourse :)I'm a fan, after binge watching the first season."
tt8289930,"Have watched every single Formula 1 race since mid-1991, I think. Went to several races (when they were louder, V12/V10 era, rather going to Le Mans with the current cars for live action). Every year after Häkkinen quit it got harder for me to justify why I even bother.4 episodes in right now - this series has a chance to change that!!I was sometimes wondering how much good a media company's ownership of F1 could do for a sport when they were helplessly talking ""Twitter"", but now I sense there might be potential.When all you get from F1 is corporate PR, little go kart boys being streamlined for TV spots, DRS and catering, here is a bit of actual behind-the-scenes of F1. Sure, this is sanitized too, but it is so much more honest than the usual, it is such a breather.Please F1, be even braver with season 2019! Hope Ferrari and Mercedes join the party with season 2019 (they opted out of this so far): Merc, if McLaren can get the sticks out of their behinds, you can too!This series has the potential to become an annual tradition to kick off pre-season ... and remember why you became a fan in the first place."
tt8289930,"I've never watched an f1 race and know nothing about the drivers or sport other than its for the rich and famous. I was so surprised at how much I REALLY liked this series. Getting to know the drivers, cars, dirty details, everything. It is so well done. Dont think ill be watching any f1 races in 2019 but will be expectantly waiting for season 2!"
tt8289930,I had never watched an F1 race before. Had no clue of the rules and points based system. Now I feel like I'm the biggest Formula 1 fan. Amazing cinematography. Best racing documentary ever made out there.
tt8289930,"It's so good to watch a F1 show that isn't mainly focused on Mercedes and Ferrari.
You really get to see what goes on inside the world of F1 and hear personal stories from the drivers and the teams.
I'd recommend it to every fan of the sport."
tt8289930,"As a F1 fan, it is very exciting to get a sneak peek behind the scenes, and see what happened in certain situations during last years season. The drivers and their teams show how they really feel about incidents on and off the track. We see the reactions on Haas F1 team, when both cars had to retire from very good positions in the first race of the season, because of errors during pitstops. We also get a better insight to why Daniel Ricciardo decided to sign with a different team for the 2019 season.
This is just a few of the things I like about this documentary series, I recommend you watch it if you are a F1 fan."
tt8289930,"In the day and age of social media everybody is a 'backseat driver' and wannabe critic, wether positive or negative. So I'm not going to say much in-depth about this mini-documentary.I loved the editing, use of material and insight not normally given into F1. Anyone who likes F1 to a certain extend and is geared up towards the 2019 season will most likely enjoy this as a primer. Anyone who isn't into F1 yet, but has a slight interest should get a good grasp of all the politics, mindgames et al that go on behind the scenes aswell.Liberty Media and Netflix, please do this every year and never mind the critics!10/10 well deserved from me"
tt8289930,"A really great way of showing the sport from the inside, as well as the several conflicts between teams and drivers that happened during the 2018 season. Good soundeffects in the race and crash scenes gave me goosebumps several times."
tt8289930,"Netflix's 'Drive to Survive' may not be respected as anything remarkable per se, yet I firmly believe this should be acknowledged as an incredibly helpful entryway for all the novices as well as the devoted supporters of the sport.As a newbie myself, I can vouch for its capability to make sure you get well familiarized with the rules and regulations. Aside from its high octane moments; you also get a slew of fascinating insights in regards to all the major teams and their set of drivers. Although the specific pattern, in which they tend to illustrate those stuff gets a little bit predictable and repetitious; but they do just enough to uphold a certain degree of urgency and suspense.Now, there were serious allegations regarding the usage of fabrication on multiple occasions.I don't know why Netflix has done such a shady business here. I mean, they already got exclusive access to Formula 1, spent millions for the rights to portray all those behind the scene incidents but instead, they resorted to performing some phony stints. Was it necessary? I don't think so."
tt8289930,"As a fun and even for those who aren't, a must see series.
Very well made and gives an approach of the fastest sports"
tt8289930,"As long F1 fan, this is nice for back stage footage, but absolutely terrible as doc. Fake narratives, fake sound effects, driver mics put in different times. Weirdly cut where it doesn't make sense. The fake commentator. He's talking about a lap and the cars are in totally different place on track, Missed ton of stuff. But the fake drama is just bad.Get some proper directors and editors that know F1. Stop creating fake stuff, 2020 season was perfect with a lot of drama. Instead you skipped most of it and created made up stories."
tt8289930,"As a lifelong F1 fan, the post production commentary is killing this show... Creating fake battles, debates, rivalries loses all grip on reality that this show could, AND SHOULD, have! Some of the sounds effects are just simply wrong, not even using the correct era of cars (sometimes even using V8 era sounds on onboard footage), and even worse due to COVID and everyone using masks, creating dialogues between team bosses or drives, that never actually happened!DTS has footage and access to create AMAZING content, but they decided to create their own storyline... No wonder Max Verstappen doesn't want to be part of this show after season 1, and if they keep this up, I wonder how many other drivers will do the same!"
tt8289930,I have never really cared for racing other than video games and being American most friends of mine that do like racing are nascar fans. Left turn driving only is boring but I randomly started this show on Netflix and I ended up binging it. It even made me look up f1 schedule on tv and since the first season I watch most races or at least record them. Well done show to see the back story of what's going on in the f1 world.
tt8289930,"I went into this show with some degree of scepticism because I was told that nor Ferrar nor Mercedes would be featured in season 1. For the less knowledgeable, this sounded too me as doing a series about La Liga without Barcelona and Real Madrid. I couldn't be more wrong.There is a vast amount of interesting narratives, stories, relationships and rivalries outside the two contenders. Enough to make me sit through season 1 in 3 days.I believe this show makes for a very entertaining watch for any (even remote) sports fans, because it has many unexpected turns, emotionally draining episodes and plenty of feel good stories. You do get emotionally attached to a few drivers, and find yourself rooting for or against them on any given episode.In my view, this show aims to get people excited about F1, much more so than entertain those who already die hard fans already. Namely because:1) Die hard fans know the outcomes of the races going in (the show reflects on the previous season, it's not live) and therefore there's less surprise or emotion. For me it was an absolute thrill to see the end of some of those grand prixs2) the show is not focus on the technical side of racing. It spends much more time on the relationships, the rivalries, the thrifts - overall the human side of the sport. Which is what makes it so engagingIt definitely made me hungrier to watch the 2020 season (whenever it can be underway) and has nurtured a bond that makes me cheer for some drivers and boo the others
F1: Drive to Survive is an absolute genius move by Liberty Media, F1 and Netflix to market Formula 1 to new audiences. I think they have nailed that objective completely.As far as converting audiences to a particular sport - I have seen nothing better. F1 Drive to Survive is an emotional and thrilling ride in one of the most challenging sports in the world. And it's truly worth it"
tt8289930,"It takes me just 24 hours to see all the 10 episodes. The film is amazing. Definitely i'm prepared for the season, that begins next week! So good luck to all drivers and let the show begins!"
tt8289930,"Ok. So I used to watch every race, every qualifying, every practice session. Schmacher and Häkkinen were my firsts and that lead to me becoming a hardcore Räikkönen fan.Things change. Things become boring and F1 is heading in that direction. Mercedes dominance is well and good for them but not for the consumer. But this show, brought back memories, interest and an overall appreciation for the sport of F1 again. Well done. May this show long continue."
tt8289930,"As a F1 fan, I really, really liked this serie. It gives such depth to the entire circus that's traveling around the world each and every year. The editing and the sound effects are really strong and give you that immersive feeling of power and speed. Please continue next season, I'm sure you will make a lot of people happy!"
tt8289930,"Poor, poor Lewis Hamilton, he was robbed of his title. He was picked last for his 3rd grade soccer team simply because all 3rd graders are racist. I feel horrible for him being one of 20, yes, TWENTY F1 drivers in THE WORLD.But I digress... Netflix obviously has to push their narrative with completely out of context reactions, interviews and reactions. Seasons 1 and 2 were exceptional. 3 was clearly not up to par and 4 complete crap. The visuals of the races are great at times when they're not cherry picked."
tt8289930,"Christ almighty. Just no pleasing some people.Thank you Liberty, Netflix and of course F1. Greatest sport and spectacle on the planet. Any chance of the same for next near?"
tt8289930,"(Flash Review)This was a really good in-depth look at some significant on track battles, driver and team insights and challenges throughout the 2018 season. Less technical and more emotional. There are veteran teams struggling, drivers fighting to keep their seat with new younger drivers aiming to make their mark and really good insights into what is really happening between the midfield teams that are often overlooked with Ferrari and Mercedes as dominating teams. The footage is high quality with F1 Insiders adding their thoughts. It was all edited to cover various moments from teams and drivers while also moving through the season. Overall, this was very engaging for big F1 fans and hopefully if they do this again Ferrari and Mercedes participate."
tt8289930,"Clearly aimed at new or casual fans, it's good entertainment and helps see the life of F1 drivers from the inside, but it makes some things up and some scenes are from races that have nothing to do with what's being shown in the episode."
tt8289930,"Netflix makes up a lot of things and are biased. Go watch 2021 season and then DTS, then YOU will feel robbed from reality.Examples:
They depicts mazepins sochi result as a great achievement. He finished ahead of his teammate and latifi. They both DNF'ed.... and he finshed 18th...They picture Hamilton as a clean racer and a victim of Max's driving style. But Hamilton is just as ruthless as Max. You cant be a 7x champion and be inocent little puppy....DTS is ridiculous and far from the reality."
tt9398466,"This is the first time I will be writing review of a web-series as it has provoked me to write about the terrible incident. Delhi Crime was an eye-opener of the famous Nirbhaya case which is intriguing and disturbing.Based on the horrific incident of 2012 Delhi gang-rape of a 23 year old girl in a moving bus, which rocked the entire nation, Delhi Crime is the chronical of the detailed investigation carried out by Delhi Police and the effort spent in nabbing the 6 accused involved in the crime within 5 days.Directed, researched (for 4 years) and created by Richie Mehta along with Laurence Bowen and Toby Bruce, Delhi Crime is one of most dark and disturbing movie I have ever seen. The seven episode series will keep you hooked to the detailed investigations starting from a wake-up call at 2 AM to the DCP of South District, Delhi Police, Vartika Chaturvedi, informing about the bleeding and naked victims, lying along streets during a cold-wintry night of Delhi, police officers travelling across the remote areas of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jharkhand to locate the accused till the confession made by Nirbhaya herself. Each and every scene has executed appropriately and accurately.Delhi Crime has been told from the Delhi Police's point of view - how their lives got impacted along with their family during those 5 days of strenuous investigation, working endlessly at the police station and not even being allowed to go back home. The web-series details out the struggles and challenges faced by the cops mentally, physically and financially (yes ... there were budget constraint even during this critical time). Few scenes do stand out - the interrogation scene between Delhi Police and remorseless Jai Singh, who was proud of his misdeed, the scene where a police call-operator wants to leave early but is always held by the DCP, the hospital scene where the doctor tells DCP about the deteriorating condition of Nirbhaya and the scene where the judge finally comes directly to record the confession of Nirbhaya. Hats off to the director for making it bold and blunt. Delhi crime was also an eye-opener for the story on the male victim, who was being sympathized by many till now. As rightly pointed out by a police officer, he could have fought against attackers in the moving bus. The web-series also shows his willingness to be in limelight by giving interviews to media, despite being warned by the DPS twice that it might spoil their investigation. Unfortunately, the media in our country is one piece of crap who would go to any extent to sell their stuff without even understanding the grimness of the situation.Delhi Crime boast off some strong technical support. I should start with an outstanding editing work. The background score is haunting and yet mesmerizing. The cinematography is brilliant, portraying a real-life crime with aplomb. Screenplay is fantastic, though it becomes little sluggish towards the 5th and 6th episode.Coming to the performances, it is Shefali Shah who will make you believe in the tough investigation carried out by the Delhi Police. Inspired by real-life IPS officer, Chhaya Sharma (former DCP South District, Delhi Police), Shefali Shah lives and breathes the character of Vartika Chaturvedi. Shefali is complimented by Rajesh Tailang (Mirzapur fame), her long-time co-worker, who stands tall with her at each and every moment. The actors playing the role police officers on field were equally marvelous.On the whole, Delhi Crime is not easy watch but it will expose the harsh reality of what happened on that fateful night and it will definitely make you angry. Go for it ...MIND-BLOWING 4.5/5"
tt9398466,"It's just great. The show shows the other perspective of the actual Happenings. The media just showed us the view point of the victims's family, the series showed us from the perspective of the investigators of the case. Thank You Netflix and Richie Mehta for making this series."
tt9398466,"These actors are the new gems of Indian Content. Wow, their acting is just amazing. Thanks Netflix for focusing on Quality over quantity. Watch it, You will love it!"
tt9398466,"Delhi Crime is no easy watch. In fact, it should come with a trigger warning. The show follows Delhi Police and how they nabbed the 6 accused in the unsettling 2012 gangrape case that shook the capital. The series is, at once, an unputdownable watch but an exhausting experience."
tt9398466,I was very angry and overwhelmed at the same time when watching this. It's an amazing take on the real heinous act of inhuman treatment and ghastly Ugly reality of our so called society which holds their values to the core but don't know how to act on them. My guts were trolling when this happened and again when i was watching this. I really hope that such demonic creatures never come into existence and the accused get the justice they deserve asap.
tt9398466,"I am on episode 5, its 2am on a working day and I aint stopping till im done with the series, not that I cant stop watching but that I wont stop. If the Delhi Police worked around the clock to bring those assholes to justice, them Im staying up to honour that, just need to figure out what to tell the boss in the morning.....on a serious note, this is one hellavu show, it has everything from the most amazing moments of sheer determination to bring a**holes to justice, to sheer strength of sacrifice not to mention some relationships are funny as hell. The acting is superb, the pace is intense. Its waaaay better then most of the crime dramas out there. I highly recommend it."
tt9398466,"Very thought provoking..
Lots of respect and our Police department.
Maybe a little slow. But to get the true the experiences they go through, it's necessity.
Casting and acting is superb. Need more shows like this to erase the misconceptions of our heros."
tt9398466,"A must watch:Compelling viewing.Let down by lack of subtitles throughout.This sort of thick accent (and I am of Indian origin) was near impossible to understand. Producers (Netflix) should have insisted on subtitles for the Hindi as well as the ""English"" dialogue!"
tt9398466,"Delhi Crime is a phenomenal film series which works both as a taut suspense thriller, a touching and heartbreaking human story, and a hard-hitting social drama. The show, which narrates the investigation following an unimaginably brutal gang rape perpetrated against a young woman, exposes images of pure, horrific barbarism in the midst of a democratic state which doesn't have enough enforcement of law and order. But then it shows that there's still hope. This hope does not necessarily come from the country's lawmakers and political authorities as it does from ordinary citizens and especially the selfless service of groups of devoted individuals who work for the police and who give their lives to make justice prevail.The series is a wonderful commentary on the restricted budgetary resources at the disposal of those who are in charge of the case, namely the police; the limited manpower assigned to them; and the pressure, both political, public, as well as from the media, which stands in the way of proper investigation of the incident in question. The show is particularly critical of the media, its enraging tendency to resort to fake news and click baits in times when not much information is available, with some members of the media being actually portrayed as true, pathetic scavengers. But then, the importance of public discourse and protest is asserted all through, and then again, the hard work of true police officers is there to save the day.That's where our heroine, DCP Vartika Chaturvedi, is placed. And it is through her dedication and perseverance that this story moves forward. Her selfless commitment to the mission affects and drives everyone around. The film places emphasis on the terrific work of the police, and while it is not an easy watch the whole time through, with some harrowing, horrifying portions, it actually manages to be quite inspiring and uplifting. Technically the film is superb - the cinematography is top-notch, the sound is fantastic, and the film is tremendously realistic and credible all the way through. The dialogue is tremendously authentic, and the setting provides the viewers with a fascinating insight of the Indian police and its daily practice.Shefali Shah, one of India's finest actresses, delivers a powerhouse performance with not a single false note. Her extraordinarily charismatic and imperious presence never takes away from her constant understanding of the human core that drives this character, resulting in a true portrait of strength and compassion. Just an expression in her eyes speaks more than a million words. The way she captures Vartika's tough exterior, soft inside, and steadfast determination, is one of the great assets of this phenomenal show. But while she leads the film, she is one of a host of brilliant actors, all of whom make Delhi Crime one of the greatest treasures of Indian filmmaking, which the country can only be proud of."
tt9398466,Show is fast paced in start but slowly looses its pace. But overall really very good show a must watch. Hats off to Delhi police for the dedication shown if they have actually done it as shown in the show. Don't believe everything which media shows.
tt9398466,"This was by far one of the best crime series I've seen. Not only do you get an insight into the everyday lives of this mega cosmopolitan task force and the challenges it faces in economic terms, there's a is a dynamic of hopeful optimism poignantly portrayed and conveyed in a way rarely seen. What's more one gets a first hand hands on look at India and it's diverse economic and complex political structure. The script is masterfully orchestrated and the constant intertwine of Hindi and English is simply fascinating. Language plays a major roll and is definitely well used to depict the various layers of social and economic strata in that bustling nation. Aside from it holding high standards as a crime series it really was extraordinarily educational to say the least. Based on a true story or perhaps several of them this is a must for all that feel in some way social justice is out of reach. It isn't if it is found such a struggling and vast nation like India. Kudos to all involved for a magnificent team effort in producing such a beautiful and gripping series. Top notch."
tt9398466,"I'd give it 7.4/10 collectively for the first 2 seasons. 1st season was too good with minimal flaws but the 2nd season looked too flat. 1st season gripped the audience till the end of it with 7 episodes but the 2nd one despite having just 5 episodes looked a bit stretched especially after the killing of the 2 men in the pronounced group. 1st season looked more realistic but the 2nd one was entirely fictional and it was just an inspiration from the infamous kachha-baniyaan group. 2nd season had unnecessary and comparatively enlarged melodrama of the families of Policemen. A lilliputian trip of Mussoorie helped 2 of the prime suspects of one of the most gruesome series of murders cut and run from the Police Station. Leave Delhi Police aside, will any Police of the world keep the prime suspects unattended like this even for a minute who aren't even handcuffed? The DP gets a call from a PCO but it was proved to be an unneeded deliberate scene as who called, nobody knows even by the end of the season. Also, the DCP just talks in English? Wasn't that unreal for Indian Police? DCP is a prestigious and quite a high rank in Police but English that too everywhere with everyone even with the DN tribal people? Anyway, even with the lousy plot and writing, the acting of the cast was top-notch. Shefali Shah, Rajesh Tailang, the main female conspirer, and a special mention to that guy who played the role of Chaddha, all excellent acting. Also, I think it was too dark, I had to increase the contrast to see scenes properly. There could be more scenes shot in daylight. Overall, I'll give 8.9/10 for the first season and 5.9/10 for the second."
tt9398466,One of the best series India has ever produced. Quite beautifully covered the sequence and very amazingly added the essence of suspense without troubling the crust of the story.Brilliant work by Shefali Shah. Her talent has been exposed after a very long time. Quite definitely a under rated actress.This series definitely will make all the youth and youngsters to join Indian Police force.Definitely everybody should watch it out!!!!Three cheers for the team for such brilliant performance!
tt9398466,"In 2012 a young couple boarded a night bus in the Indian capital; he was beaten but she was brutally raped by the six men on board. They were then dumped, naked, from the moving bus. We aren't shown any of that; we just see then boarding the bus before switching to the police vehicle which does to the scene. Pressure on the police is very high with public, press and politicians demanding a rapid resolution to the case. Officers led by DCP Vartika Chaturvedi search to find the bus and its driver. The hunt for others, particularly two only known by nicknames won't be as easy.I would heartily recommend this series; it deals with a crime that shook India and was reported around the world in a sensitive way. We do not have to see the crime to know how vile it was; descriptions of what happened to the young woman are disturbing enough. The investigation is interesting to watch as it shows the difficulties the police face as the struggle to get results quickly with limited resources. The series is shot on location and looks great; capturing the contrasts in the city. The cast is impressive; both those playing major characters and those in smaller roles.These comments are based on watching the series in Hindi with English subtitles."
tt9398466,"What a portrayal to a heart wrenching crime this country has witnessed. Phenomenal direction and a glimpse on how Police department works. Binge watch, eagerly waiting for 2nd season."
tt9398466,"Why Shefali's character talks too much English. I can understand may be sometimes but with alomst everyone she talks in English. Which was very unrealistic. In last episode, her daughter was speaking Hindi but Shefali kept on responding to her in English only. Also the storyline wasn't as gripping as the first part.Also the way they have releaved the culprits wasn't justified.Good part is few episodes or else it would have felt very boring.They missed it this time. Best of luck for the next season.So ultimately season 2 isn't good compared to season 1 or any other crime thriller. Frankly there were no thrilling moments."
tt9398466,This tv series was more on Delhi Police views.Much different then the what media had reported.The way Delhi Police chase all of the victim and captured.Also the side of politics and media.Thank you Netflix for making such tv series. Acting is superb by all the cast.
tt9398466,"Season One is based on investigations in Nirbhaya gangrape case. Series relied upon real events and facts surrounding the investigations. Nirbhaya was brutally gangraped and her boyfriend was assaulted on a moving bus in winter of December-16. There were six culprits. Everything happened in the dark of the night. So to recreate the chain of events, to find out the bus and to identify the victims were very difficult tasks. But Delhi police under the leadership of DCP Vartika Chaturvedi crack this case in five straight days. She forms her own investigating team and each team works on minute details and leads. Though there are some really powerful performances, by and large, all cast did their job nicely and fit into their respective characters perfectly. Characterisation was so good that you can very well predict how one would behave in a given situation. Writer did include some drama by using subplots involving families of cops and some politics of Delhi. This does interrupt the buildup of tension. But overall, series is written very nicely and most the time it does not lose grip over the main plot."
tt9398466,I knew Shifali Shah would do a fantastic job in the series and she did exceptionally good acting. It was made brilliantly. Screen Play was fantastic.
tt9398466,"My eyes were glued to the screen both when it came to season 1 and season 2. At times, series makers or directors of an artistic work tend to drift apart in the second season but the dedication and the plot that has consistently nailed the suspense, links, facts, and all the spice that is needed to make this piece of work an amazing success has left me speechless. The team really needs a medal from the leaders of India for giving such a marvellous account of reality and how our police force overcomes the odds to sustain their personal life and solve the most gruesome crimes in our country. Yes, everyone does make faults, but these records shed a light into the justice system of India and although there are people of unstable minds and because of the sufferings that they face, they tend to become anti-social elements in the society, but our police force and especially those officers who stand for the right side even if they stand alone, need to be saluted for their courage and guts of such brilliance. You want to know how gems of our country in our capital city solve such deadly crimes? Then connect to Netflix at once, and see that justice is not dead in our country and that officers of such magnanimous courage exist too. Jai Hind! Jai Bharat!"
tt9398466,"As a procedural it is very good.
Great directing, good acting, a very gripping story based on real events. It is so interesting that I watched the whole thing in one day.
My main issue with the series is that sometimes it looks like if a PR agency wrote the script to glorify Delhi Police.
Mind you, I know nothing about Delhi and their police, but I doubt any police force in the world is as holly as the one in this series."
tt9398466,"Season 1 was very well done, and even though we knew the story (being based on the infamous and tragic Nirbhaya case), it was taut.Season 2 is also taut for 3-3.5 of the 5 episodes. But because it is fiction (as the modern version of the infamous past Kachha-Baniyan gang), they have a hard time coming up with a way the police can track any member of the new gang. Suddenly in ep. 4, the police magically get the mobile number of one of the gang members. They show some unexplained scene for about 10 seconds, after which the police IT guy gets a gang member's name and mobile number! This sleight of hand in the script, totally lost it for me: if you can do such sleight of hand, then no crime thriller will be credible (and that after being led down the garden path of a taut credible thriller for about 70% of the show), will not be worth spending one's valuable time on, and will be the death of the genre. Furthermore, in ep. 5, they subsequently show some other very unrealistic events, it seems in an attempt to hurriedly bring the show to a conclusion, that puts further dents into the overall story. Also, they could have shown the police consulting a psychologist to determine what could have led a person to commit such horrific crimes against rich elderly people (psychopath personality along with how that may have developed could have been one explanation), but there was no such reveal. Instead the police DSP (the main character played by Shefali Shah) just ends with a weak (to paraphrase): ""Even the criminal can't answer the question of why they committed such crimes"". What a cop out and what a damp squib of an ending! If you can't finish well, then the whole endeavor is a waste. And wastes the viewer's time.BTW, IMDB really needs to separate the ratings of different seasons of a show, as they can be such different animals, and it is misleading to the viewing public if the good rating for a good season falsely bolsters the rating for a poor one, and vice versa."
tt9398466,"Season one would be very hard to top but season two came pretty close. This series reminds me of the original Day of the Jackal. Slow, methodical detective work. With the exception of the tech guy these officers are working with the most basic tools and they still get the job done. English dubbing is excellent where the subtitles seem a bit off. After season two I think they should make action hero figures of this team! Culturally worlds apart but still very engaging for this US viewer. All the b-roll of Mumbai is actually a treat. Not sure where it could go from here but I'm glad that we had seasons one and two."
tt10048342,"You'll end up like me, binge watching it until 5 AM (and I don't even know anything about chess). Very well written, directed and acted."
tt10048342,"The Queen's Gambit was a random find for me. I started watching it without any expectations but the first episode was just enough to keep me interested. As I kept watching, it kept getting better and I must say the 7th episode was one of the best finale to a series that I have ever watched. The character developments for even the minor characters were well-thought-out and I immediately formed an emotional connection with most of them. The finale was so well done that it almost felt like an end to a show with several seasons rather than a limited series. The show also had very good messages sprinkled in between, they were subtle and didn't make me feel like an agenda was being showed down my throat. The acting was marvelous. The cinematography was great with some very impressive scene transitions. The score was amazing and really set the atmosphere and the tone of the show. If you are reading this before watching the show, go ahead and watch it. You won't be disappointed."
tt10048342,"When you've seen everything on Netflix, a you will watch any new show they throw at you. I did not have high expectations. But I was so wrong. So wonderfully and totally wrong.
We watched Queen's Gambit, all seven hours of it, in a single sitting. This show is an absolute gem. Remarkable acting by Anya Taylor-Joy who will be a force to be reckoned with, her child counterpart- an absolute marvel. The series is smart, it's inspiring at times, it's sad and heartbreaking at times. Who knew watching game-plays of simulated chess can make your heart pound out of your ears? Truly, a story of determination, friendship, self discovery, struggle and triumph. I don't know about you, but my ceiling will be covered in chess pieces tonight."
tt10048342,"It's not only a good series, it's not only the wonderful story, acting, cinematography, music. You watch it and it feels like the movie itself is a chessgame. With a rather weak opening indeed, a fabulous middlegame and a perfect ending. It's the kind of movies/series that stucks you in your armchair, on your couch or even in your bed anyway, forgetting about eating, sleeping, living. After the end, the return to reality has not yet occurred. You are still tormented in dimly lit orphanages, you travel all over the world, you are welcomed in super-bright chess tournaments a little more arrogant and well-dressed and you analyze variants. Do not miss it!"
tt10048342,"Watched it all in one night.
I didn't think a story about chess would keep me interested. But this one got me deeply invested.
Because this is not just about the game of chess, it's so much more.Ultimately, what I cared about wasn't just the game anymore, it was the person. I was rooting for her. I really cared what would happen to her and that's probably the most essential thing for me when watching any tv series.What made me attached to this character was how I saw her grow up from a little orphan girl, witnessing her from the first chess game all the way to the end and everything in between.
I was enthralled, inspired, moved, proud.
Had me in tears too.
Excellent cast, story, cinematography, writing, everything.
Thank you for this. Thank you."
tt10048342,Really enjoyed this series. One reviewer gave a low rating mentioning how the first episode showed her using pills in the orphanage....yes they had to as it shapes the rest of her future. The characters are great and the acting on is superb. Kept me hooked!
tt10048342,"Yes, yes, Anya Taylor-Joy and those eyes. Superb, praise from the rooftops.But let's also acknowledge that the astonishing Isla Johnston carries the first few episodes with an equally compelling performance, far beyond her years.The handover from Isla to Anya is almost seamless, which is quite remarkable when we consider the intensity of the character. That an actor of Johston's age could have pulled that off is extraordinary."
tt10048342,"Top to bottom, scenic design, wardrobe, direction and casting, this is a top notch production. The acting is seamless and the characters embody their roles perfectly.One couldn't hope for a more original or more compelling story. As you might expect from the title, Chess plays a central role, and the author's use of the game as an extended metaphor shifts in ways both nuanced and explosive. For any thinking person, this series is sure to delight.In my opinion, strong characterization always provides the best entertainment. The producers of ""The Queen's Gambit"" tackle the tough task of creating a compelling story from the inner lives of the characters. Granted, they are working from an excellent novel, but oftentimes, attempts to bring works that center around the mental, rather than the physical journey of the central character fail miserably. In this case, the producers deserve the highest praise. If you like thoughtful stories that expose the inner lives of the characters, don't miss this one.The show, while generally acceptable for children, contains several adult themes, so parental guidance is recommended."
tt10048342,"I did like the story, I did like the settings, I did like the acting and the chess theme. But as the story progressed I started to feel slightly annoyed by the main character, additionally the story got boring as it was always the same, nothing really compelling happened. I did watch till the end, but I didn't find this series overly exceptional as other reviewers did. However, I really liked the depiction of that era and how difficult it was for women at that time."
tt10048342,"This is not the typical type of show that I would usually watch but I'm so glad I did. It's so unique and different that it's difficult to put into words. If you're thinking of watching this show, just do it, you won't be disappointed."
tt10048342,"Starts great, gets boring and repetitive, great but obvious end. Awesome music, photography and direction."
tt10048342,"This TV Mini-series is excellent! It is wonderful to see Anya Taylor-Joy in a well crafted show. She shines brilliantly as Beth Harmon a chess playing prodigy. The story takes us from when she is a small girl, orphaned, continuing through her teenage angst years. I highly recommend this show. Great cinematography and directing and of course to get back to the acting - its top notch! I only wish there was more than 7 episodes."
tt10048342,I don't normally review shows but this one was fantastic! I watched the entire series in less then 24 hours and would watch it again in a heartbeat. Every episode is good. It stays strong the entire series and captivates you. I would not be surprised if this show wins tons of awards. 10/10 would recommend.
tt10048342,After the first two episodes I cancelled my friday night plans to watch this series in one sitting.
tt10048342,You will binge watch this like I did guaranteed. What an amazing 8 hour movie.
tt10048342,I was absolutely blown away by how good The Queen's Gambit was! The only reason I actually started watching it was because of all the great ratings/reviews and I'm glad I did because it was such an entertaining series. It's set during the Cold War era and follows orphaned chess prodigy Beth Harmon (Anya Taylor-Joy) as she struggles with addiction in her quest to become the greatest chess player in the entire world. Taylor-Joy has been a rising star for the last few years but she breaks out here as she was just absolutely terrific as the lead. She's now one of the hottest young actresses in Hollywood. This ended up winning an Emmy for most Outstanding Limited Series.
tt10048342,I actually didn't really have any plans on actually watching The Queen's Gambit when I first saw the trailer. Then I couldn't stop hearing about how good this show was by just about everyone and saw all the award nominations it's gotten so I figured I'd give it a chance. I'm so glad I did. I never thought a series based around chess would be so entertaining. I couldn't stop watching and ending binging all 7 episodes over one weekend. Anya Taylor Joy deserves every bit of love she's received for her job in this. She's become a really good actress. This show will hook and will have you thinking about chess non stop but you don't need to know anything about chess to enjoy this. It's so much more than a series about chess.
tt10048342,"I found this entertaining, but I couldn't bring myself to like the main character, Beth, or care much about her ""journey"". The progression was pretty boring and obvious. I consider this worth watching if you are having a hard time finding something, but ignore the hype or you may end up disappointed like I was."
tt10048342,"While I am an avid chess player, you do not need to love chess in order to love this series. This is the first time I have ever given a rating a perfect 10. The cast is beyond amazing, Anya Taylor-Joy did an outstanding job. The story and writing was brilliant. The cinematography was perfection and captured every little detail for the time period. The music was perfect!The only disappointment is that there probably will not be a season two."
tt10048342,"Imagine your standard, come-from-behind, feel-good sports movie, but with chess. The plot isn't exactly the same, but it's just as banal. In spite of being 5 times longer, its characters are just as shallow. The way they briefly touch on racism/sexism/addiction seem designed more to score brownie points and support the audience's sense of moral superiority than engage the audience in any form of critical thinking. What little chess they show in this series seems wildly unrealistic, from the rapid-fire moves to the clapping during play. I had trouble believing someone who looks 28 playing a 13-year-old character.But hey, the cinematography is great, and like those cheesy sports movies, you can count on a warm fuzzy feeling at the end."
tt10048342,"Enjoyed this series but like many other reviews I found the storyline was slow, predictable, cliches to the brim & wonder if it needed to be a series rather than a movie. I mainly hung around to see the sets rather than the storyline. I didn't like the main character & was disappointed with the concept of her brilliance as a chess player throughout the series. Defs not feeling like its a 9 or 10 rating."
tt10048342,You know it's good when you don't care were your cellphone is.
tt10048342,An incredible series. An absolute joy to watch and a complete surprise. Anya Taylor-Joy was wonderful. I honestly have never heard of her and she was absolutely perfect for the role. I would have loved to see it last so much longer.
tt8858472,"Daniel Sloss easily jumps from topic to topic, effortlessly stitching the show together - going from jaw-dropping topics to heartfelt comments in the wink of an eye.I hope there will be more!"
tt8858472,I have watched all kind of comedy stand up and the genuine darkness of the topics was amazing. His jokes were so well written. I would rewatch this any day. It's like a beautiful jigsaw everything fits in to place. Please watch this with an open mind because even death can be funny so just laugh.
tt8858472,"I tend to not laugh at most of the netflix comedians and not because I find them offensive, because they are just making jokes you know.. It's dumb to get offended by jokes especially by dark humor. You may NOT laugh at dark humor, but like I said it is a joke after all. Daniel is a really funny guy and probably one of the best comedians so far. (on netflix.) I really don't understand anyone who's making negative comments about him and everyone who does it exactly like the guy he talked about in first part of Dark :D. So yes go ahead make negative comments about him but we aaallll know he's right and you're just butthurrt"
tt8858472,He knows how to play and deliver a joke! Really smart and funny!
tt8858472,"Truly funny to the bone.If you are sensitive, don't watch.
If you love watching comedians do their craft, sit back and be impressed."
tt8858472,"I enjoyed it very much! It was really funny and emotional at the same time. Daniel Sloss is really talented, not only in comedy but also in understanding life, pain, relationships etc. I especially enjoyed 'Dark' and watched it so many times. His understanding of comedy is dark, that's for sure, but the way he forms his jokes makes him more relatable, i think. I recommend this to anyone who is not too sensitive. Thank you Daniel Sloss for making me laugh so much!!"
tt8858472,Extremely entertaining and well done; he also made some really good points that I'm going to be thinking about for a while !! strongly recommed!
tt8858472,"Ok so am gonna split this review for each episode and then am gonna summarize at the end.
DARK
It starts off really well but kind of fades at the end with the whole ""paralyzed sister's death bit"". His intentions to show funny in tragedy was daring but he doesn't live up to the task as he fails to lift the mood for a long while towards the end.
JIGSAW
This was by far a more complete show. This episode is where Daniel delivers and lives up to the hype. the show is intelligently written and is genuinely funny.(not so much if you are Facebook vegan). There are serious rofl moments plus the creative message where he added his personal touch to the show.so inconclusion I recommend powering through the first episode just to be able to watch the second one. I hope Daniel continues working on his material and develop a full comedian persona on stage because I believe he has potential to be one of the greats.
PS: I rated a 7 because the first show dragged it down, the second episode deserves a much higher rating. (Seriously check it out even if you are vegan)."
tt8858472,"The only reason someone does not like his style might be the lack of understanding his point. It is sort of socially crtitical and in a smart and intelligent way. I like his style as it makes you think and laugh. If you like Seinfeld for example, you dislike Daniel Sloss. Seinfeld is the kind of consevative comedy I totally get bored, because there is no courage to it. Where Jeselnik goes way too far, Sloss is spot on. I think one should be more into Monty Python than classical American comedy to get into his shows. This guy is really smart and I can totally live up his joie de vivre. Even if I did disagree on some points, I get it from his point of life experience. For example I really liked the twist when it comes to his ex wife and being a vegan. That was one of those clever things in the show but disgreed with his analogy in some point. This guy rocks and this is just my humble opinion, nothing else."
tt8858472,"... although he is constantly factually incorrect. He really knows how to turn complex psychological insights into jokes. I think this is a rare talent. His problem is that he is a leftist, who wants to dance on the woke side of things. He goes over the edge on things that are safe, for that particular moment in time. He is a rare comedian, who can still, with all that echo chamber stuff, make good jokes. Most leftist comedians have zero jokes and 100% echo chamber repetitions, that serve only to make people on the far left, comfortable with their delusions."
tt8858472,I barely cracked a smile through any of his routine. It started off decent in Dark but then got really boring and Jigsaw was more of a rambling lecture than a comedy act. I was waiting for it to get funny but it never did so switched off.
tt8858472,"FULL DISCLOSURE, I watched this show 'cos a girl I like recommended it and I thought it would be a good way of finding out what she deems to be 'dark' comedy.
It is a testament to how much I like this girl that I sat through 15 mins before shouting ""nope, can't do it"" and decided to waste no more of my Sunday. There aren't words in any of the romance languages to explain how void of ""dark"" or any kind of comedy his material is and how utterly punchable Daniel Sloss is.
I would prefer any dark comedy over this. I would prefer any comedy over this. I would prefer sitting in the dark to this. Ironically most of the act is Sloss inflating his own ego with claims of how dark he is. His skin tone clearly darker than his own comedy.
After a few minutes I wondered if his act was part of some too clever meta comedy where he would deliberately flop to then come out with an actual joke that lands in a way to mock the audience. No. We were mocked for simply having endorsed this man to the point that this was made. Afterwards, I sat in self pitying shameful silence not felt since seeing my own reflection in my laptop after enjoying an evening with myself the night before. That at least had a happy ending.
I went online within seconds of pausing the show to create an account here just to have a space to rant and warn others how truly awful this show is. Sloss makes Amy Schumer look like Billy Connolly. The worst part of the experience wasn't the dis interesting delivery or his banal choice of words or his underserved self confidence. It was the cringe inducing pause before telegraphed set ups that now mean even silence causes me to have rage inducing flashbacks of a show that will make me sit on the floor of my shower for an hour after writing this to try to wash it off... No wait, the worst thing is that I cannot delete it from netflix so I will have to live with the perverse knowledge that I indirectly endorse and own his material. This is the first and last review I will ever write. It will most likely never be seen. I pray by some miracle of serendipity the same is true of Daniel Sloss and his career."
tt8858472,"I don't care that he is a left wing athiest, so was Bill Hicks and he was a genius. My problem is that this guy seems to think that his opinions are in any way rebellious or transgressive. People like him have the support of 90% of all academics, politicians, celebrities and the entire main stream media. His opinions are hardly daring or fringe. As usual, the religion he does target is Christianity, what a surprise. None of these people would dare to criticise Islam or Judaism, because that would actually get them in trouble. I am not even a Christian myself, but the double standard is annoying. Netflix pumps out so much trash it is insane. As soon as I'm done watching Norm MacDonald's new show, I'm cancelling. This man is mediocracy incarnate. Nuck Fetflix!"
tt8858472,"I love comedy, especially dark humour. I waited and waited, but the jokes never came.
Netflix comédiens are the worst. I have trouble getting to sleep, but their line-up puts me to sleep quickly. There are some exceptions, such as Dave Chapelle and Demetri Martin.
Daniel Sloss is not in the best of list. He thinks his accent sounds intelligent, but he is not British, so...."
tt8858472,"One condescending lecture after another, with some clever jokes thrown in. Like every other comedian today, lectures include how the audience is allowed to engage with the comedian, which I've heard done better by Maria Bamford, Anthony Jeselnek, etc etcYes, we know. Just tell the jokes, already."
tt11052470,"As someone else commented , this is a class act production/acting & one of the best in Kdrama series.This show is so unique, beautiful, touching, emotional, gentle, gut-wrenching and humanizing from beginning to the end. Episode 9, especially, really got to me and you know what I mean when you watch it and I hope that you do.When Kdramas are good, they are really good better than many US/international shows out there and thankfully their TV series are not always full of violence, gore, sex scenes or bad language. The good ones are just all about true storytelling and always thought provoking.I hope that there will be a 2nd season. This show deserves one."
tt11052470,"A tender and deeply moving series with a terrific cast, director, and writer. One of SK's best."
tt11052470,"I was taken with this series from episode one. It was clear that the part of Han Geu-ru was not an easy one to play but Tang Joon-Sang does admirably. Korean dramas are quite fond of leading characters on the autism spectrum: The Good Doctor, Alice (Joo Won in both cases) and now this. No love story here to speak of for a nice change but a series of stories created by a former trauma cleaner. There is a sub plot but the main thrust of each story is the cleanup following traumatic death and those that do it. Each vignette has quite the powerful message conveyed through the fearsome logic of a 20 year-old Man born with Asbergers Syndrome. Get-ru's uncle moves in as his guardian following the death of the father. Together they run Move To Heaven and each story follows a traumatic death. On a personal note episode 5 following a rare gay love story for Korea had me in floods of tears, but all episodes are quite affecting."
tt11052470,"There's not a single episode where I didn't cry, I love all of the deceased back stories and the acting of the two main leads is incredible. The script is one of the best I've seen this year! Definitely Worth Watching!"
tt11052470,"Netflix's Move to Heaven is an unexpected gem, one of the best dramas produced from South-Korea, told in a realistic and wonderful way, unique and very original Korean drama, and will truly appeal to a global audience.Originality, sincerity and universal values are what makes Korean dramas produced by Netflix stand out compared to the regular Korean dramas which are still very catered to the local audience. From Kingdom, to Love Alarm, to Sweet Home and now Move to Heaven. All amazing pieces of art that are unique and very original.The story centers around trauma cleaners, who are people who clean up and move stuff of the deceased. This explains the title of this drama: Move to Heaven. It is also the name of their company. In 10 episodes we see multiple story arcs evolving, including those of the main characters Han Geu-ru played amazingly by Tang Jun-sang and his uncle Cho Sang-gu. We see very relevant social themes being addressed by the trauma cleaners, all in a very sincere, realistic and emotional way. Keep your tissue box ready though!A special shout-out to Tang Jun-sang for his epic performance and realistic portrayal of the Asperger syndrome and for connecting the different story lines. His character is smart, remembers everything, connects the dots, and speaks like a robot. It is something that viewers will not easily forget.Han Geu-ru was told to tell himself every day in the mirror that he did an excellent job. I can only agree, and would like to extend this to the whole show. You did an excellent job!"
tt11052470,"This remind me of Midnight Diner, if the Master listened to his customer's stories. Move to Heaven try to listen what the deceased through their belongings and it is sooo beautiful. It's another level of family drama and it tells a story that a child with disability like asperger syndrome, can fit in in the society with the right cognitive taught and love. I loveeee this series and finished overnight, I need more stories like this. The acting, the set, the plot, the vibe all perfect💛✨"
tt11052470,"One of, if not the best kdrama I've watched. Wonderful writing, acting, directing, editing, cinematography, casting -- but most of all beautiful stories told and characters molded in little time (relatively shorter than most kdramas).Shows the beauty, the good, and the love behind every person and will have us second-guessing and postponing our prejudice.Wonderful use of Trauma Cleaning and Asperger's Syndrome as a plot.Much of the storyline has been resolved by the end of the season so I'm not looking forward to a second but they have good foundations in characters and framework unlike most kdramas so I think there's potential."
tt11052470,"South Korea has been known to make some incredible movies for many years. This is the ""first"" South Korean series I've ever watched (my wife and kids wanted to see it so I ""had"" to oblige).Despite not being a choice I made, I was completely stunned by the level of quality this series offers: Top notch acting, incredible, touching stories and an incredible character arch development. I can easily say that when I watch quality stuff like this, I hardly miss the expensive special effects and over-the-topness of some ""current"" series, specially American produced ones. Not that it a bad thing, but it shows how a greatly written show can be made successful without showing budget muscle. Still, this ISN'T a low budget affair: the camera work is incredible, the shots, the cinematography, the music, the acting. Like most modern series, this looks more like a movie than a TV show.No spoilers this time, you have to see, ""Move To Heaven"". Some might find it a bit corny... probably those looking for a more action oriented series, but the little action sequences here are incredibly filmed and will come as an unexpected surprise to some.10 out of 10. Yeah, it is THAT good!"
tt11052470,"This was an emotional ride with every singel emotion known ... I have probably cried every singel type of tear i know of.... so to say I was touched is an understatement.This drama also taught me that even dead people communicate, we just have to listen and observe the objects they leave behind and that as long as some one is in your memory you will never be alone... kind of creepy but sweet and comforting."
tt11052470,Life is comprise of many regrets but a matter of fact we need to learn to minimize the regret in our life. Learn to cherish the things you have and treat your healthy normal life as a plus vs many unfortunate ones. Seldom watch drama series but this one makes me cannot resist.
tt11052470,"Please, please, please give Move To Heaven a chance. It is most definitely my top favorite K-drama of 2021. The cast simply did a fantastic job playing their respective roles and told the overall plot/story so beautifully. Loved how every episode had a different tale of the deceased talked about. I cried a ton so have tissues near and handy. Tang Joon Sang is not on the spectrum and is much younger in real life but embodied Geu Ru so well. As someone who is autistic, he played the role of someone who truly had this disability very realistically. Also, just because someone has a disability does not mean they can't do things. Anyone is capable of anything they want to do when one simply has the goal and motivation to. After this drama, he is going to get bigger roles because of taking the chance with this one. I'm looking forward to his next role. Lee Jee Hoon is so very TALENTED and I highly recommend you watch his recently aired drama Taxi Driver because that's where I first discovered him and was swooned by his acting! Anyways, please watch this drama because you will not regret it!!"
tt11052470,"I like the theme of the series and all actors played their roles well. But overhyping some kdramas is really starting to get on my nerves. Why people won't stop overreacting and when will they start being a little more realistic when rating kdramas? It's not perfect. Far from it.FYI,when you overhype them,those dramas immediately drop points cause they don't rise to everyone's expectations. When I see ratings so high,I expect no filler episodes,no boring scenes and no predictable plots. And this one has all this.So,I don't blame drama makers,I blame ppl who rate those dramas so high as if they never watched anything very well made before.And last but no least. LAST EPISODE. Why they had to make saints out of Geu-ru's parents? I don't like when there is no end to exaggeration, they exaggerate beyond all measures of exaggeration. No one is like that. People like that just don't exist. No one is that perfect,so I would appreciate it more if his parents stories weren't shown in a way of perfect human beings who endlesly suffer and sacrifice for other people cause no one in this world is like that.Uncle and ""next door"" had amazing chemistry. Actor who played Geu-ru did really great job."
tt11052470,So touchy that I cry every episode.I loved the story of each single episode .Is very emotional and deep.
tt11052470,"I've been lately getting overwhelmed by Korean series on Netflix. One the best examples I can give is Move to Heaven. What brilliant drama it is! It really touches your heart, sometimes it breaks it, sometimes it heals.. A complete drama with all the ingredients needed for making an excellent series. A must watch for fans of all genre."
tt11052470,"Review By Kamal KThe series is all about emotions and feelings, especially, empathy towards the deceased who are no more in the world yet they have left their own messages to their loved once. The only thing we need to look for their message is by having empathy and the power to look through bits and pieces of their belongings. This series will make you respect the ""Trauma Cleaners"" which is a designation that I didn't know existed until this series. I have built a huge respect for them. Whoever is reading my review, get ready to cry your heart out because the story is so heart touching. You just can't resist from crying. The structure of story-telling was great, simple yet grandeur. The editing was amazing, CGs were top-notch, the effects were beautiful and last but not the least, the actors/cast, they were all amazing in acting and made me feel like I am one of the characters in the story. All in all, I believe everyone in the world should watch this series to develop their empathy and to understand and have compassion towards each other. It is a very good lesson for all the human beings to never give up on your life because there's nothing more precious than a human life."
tt11052470,"Those that haven't experience trauma or loss, or have no patience or introspection; just don't watch. Watch 1 episode, say it was boring and leave your 5-6 rating...For the rest of humanity, this is a beautiful story. If you have any feelings at all, be prepared to pause and cry. The occasional overacting and goofy translation, deal with it and ignore as there are so many amazing performances here and some really funny moments too.One of the best shows on Netflix without a doubt. The best thing I've ever seen come out of Korea, absolutely. I can't recommend this show enough."
tt11052470,"Ahh it's just full of emotions made me cry so much, the story of this series is really unique and every story for each person made me think a lot.. worth your time believe me 👍🏻"
tt11052470,A young man with Aspergers works for his father at a company called move to heaven which clears the properties of recently deceased people. When tragedy strikes his step brother becomes involved in the company and he is not the caring or compassionate type but over time will he view things differently. Each episode deals with the death of an individual and looks back at their lives and how the young man with aspergers can see the things other people miss relating to their deaths. A predictable series but because of the quality of the acting and script it draws you in and each death usually means a heartbreaking look at the final days of a person and the struggles before they pass away.
tt11052470,"This is a clever concept, Here are many moving stories, beautifully photographed, and the series is almost excellent. But it is spoiled by some over-acting. I know that this is common in many Asian movies, and is widely accepted, but does not have to be the case. Look at the success of recent Korean movies which have won acting awards.. In this case, a little holding back, ""being"" the character instead of ""acting"" the character would have added two more stars.I understand that this series is made for Koreans and I can be accused of cultural elitism, but the fact is that it is being distributed world-wide on Netflix, where we are now regularly exposed to films and TV series from around the world. Standards are very high.Despite my reservations, I intend to watch all episodes.Edit: Maybe a little unfair. There are some fine performances here also. Geu Ru's father, Yoon Na Mu's father, the tailor - are all good and believable Sorry I cannot find the names of these actors."
tt11052470,"The story telling and writing in this programme is unbelievably amazing and realistic. The characters are fantastically written and acted out beautifully by the actors. I love this programme! I don't wanna give much away but even if you're not into Korean programmes it's the kind of programme you have to watch at least once in your life time!! I cried EVERY single episode as the characters were so easy to get attached too. Shout out to the actor who played the guy with alsperger's syndrome, he did a great job! The actor for the uncle did great too! All the actors did! I'm so glad I watched this, it was truly beautiful! I won't be able to get over this for weeks."
tt11052470,"I like how this drama explores different social issues- it makes me more aware of them. From the abandonment of old people, LGBT to problems with overseas adoption, I've gained different perspectives after watching this drama.Lee Je-hoon's role is sexy, an outwardly cold man who is involved in illegal boxing, but has a soft side (though he likes to deny it). Tang Joon-sang plays his role well too. His acting as a mentally disabled kid seems natural. I enjoy watching the growth of the characters.However, the pace is sometimes too slow for me. I don't have the urge to keep watching the drama. Maybe the genre is not my type. I even wonder why are there still so many episodes left. So if there are many episodes of this instead of only 10, I might gave up."
tt11052470,"I was really waiting a lot of from this drama. But it was just waste of time. The storyline wasn't focus on the relationship between the uncle and the child (which has perspectives to be better) and the plot was really predictable and sometimes boring. Also, after seeing the great performance of Oh Jeong-Se ,as Moon Sang Tae, in the kdrama ""It's okay ,not to be okay"", playing the autistic , Tang Joon-sang as Geu Ru in the drama ""Move to Heaven"" seems to be so bad acting. Moreover, all the supporting roles was just unnecessary as well as the first half of episodes with the stories of the customers which was so boring.The worst is that the high moment,the finale was so bad and I caught myself thinking ""what the h@ll was that?"""
tt11301642,I am an Anglo Canadian for context. This series is among the finest I have seen in a long time. This gem needs no polishing. Every aspect is absorbing without any pretentions. Despite the cultural setting of multiple slices of Turkish society enveloped in secular and traditional tensions; each of the characters was well developed and very real. The interactions between the characters are so brilliantly crafted they elevate the drama beyond national borders. The actors are completely new to me but have become instantly memorable. A follow-up series? Just do it!
tt11301642,"I'm not turkish but I visited several times, the show explains a lot of the contrast in lifestyle and culture present in Turkey.
I love that the writing is not biased against any of the social levels and the scenario is very natural and sincere
The cinematography, music and acting is excellet.
I think personally a lot of international audience can relate to the story as alot of communities have the same polarisation within that feels like the fabric of the society is no longer consistent.
Its the same here in Egypt and Middle East in general. We are exposed to same socio-economic and political unbalance, so its no surprise we reach the same outcomes.
I can't wait for more episodes to be released! Please keep up the good work."
tt11301642,"Have not seen such tremendous work for ages and i see lot of international TV shows. Every scene is so beautifully portrayed. It's provoking.It gets you. It should win lot of awards.Some of the best #ÖykuKarayel performance here. What cast ensemble.
Just WOW!!! 👌 🏆"
tt11301642,"I never expected to see a Turkish tv series like this in my life. As an Arab, I've seen nothing Turkish but soap operas, and that had a role in my perception of Turkish production.First of all, I watched the trailer in the day it was released 12/11/20 and I thought it was a movie, nonetheless, its style grabbed me, so I decided to watch it. After I watched the first episode I was shocked because of it, all I can say about that episode is one word, perfect. The first episode sat the bar high for me, and after I finished the series I wanted to write few things about it.
I loved its style, the direction was perfect, you can notice the influence of Wes Anderson in it, which is a good thing, and not only in the direction, but in all other aspects, including writing, cinematography, the wide scene which then turns into a closeup through quick zoom, and the style of comedy. Speaking of comedy, this series has a lot of it, and better than comedy, it has a smart comedy, the one that makes you laugh just by the settings of the scene or by the clumsy behaviour of the characters which always felt real, or even when some characters meet other characters you cant help but laugh. There are a lot of stories, and through these stories you get to know a lot about modern Turkey and the Turkish society, and each story had a reason to exist. The colours were so beautiful, it's probably the most beautiful series I've ever seen and one of the most beautiful works, this was because of the spectacular cinematography and production design, and because of the selection of the music. As for acting, every actor did his job in the best way possible, so, I wouldn't want to talk about a certain actor or actress and leave the rest; because they're all perfect, I who is an actor-wannabe will always look up to their work in this art of work and take them as role models. This is the thing about this series, there is a company that's willing to produce such art, and creative creators and actors who are all talented and hardworking in their job, and the result was a masterpiece. I hope I said everything that I have in my heart for this series. I wish to see more from the whole team. Thank you for this masterpiece."
tt11301642,"I was pleasantly surprised watching this series. I am an American. Recently I noticed a lot of options on Netflix came from Turkey. I do not know much about Turkey. About two weeks ago, I decided to watch Resurrection - Etrugrul. I am still watching it. I wanted to watch it because I am of mixed race. I am part Native American and part Original Colonist. I was not raised on a Native (or Indian) Reservation. My father took us all over the world. I wanted to watch Tribal conflicts and the introduction of Christianity from another perspective. Anyway, I decided to watch. I loved it. I had no idea Turkey was so modern. I thought it might be a place like some reservations, where people are trying to combine their traditions and culture but the youth want a place in this modern world. The natives leave because they need jobs. They are of course exposed to a different world. I liked Ethos a lot. I liked seeing that the struggle with being human and especially with being a female is common with all of us. That is the best part about the whole series. It shows how we are connected. I also liked reading all the reviews. They opened my eyes to the thread that links us together. I loved the series and can't wait for the next season."
tt11301642,"Turkish cinema has produced 2 phenomenal work of art in last decade. First one, Persona (2018), which was the rebirth, silver lining of the long dead performance arts, and Ethos showed us that Persona was just a beginning for a lot to come."
tt11301642,"This is probably the best series shot in Turkey since Masum. Acting is just on point, Öykü Karayel particularly nailed the role and her accent. But what I appreciate the most is the director's artistic style and vision. It's a realistic, captivating story with amazing cinematography and solid soundtrack.By the way, I can't believe there are actually people who criticize this show because ""there's lack of diversity"". Sorry for being realistic? At least do some research on the country's demographics before claiming such thing. This point of view is no different than casting a black actor for Zeus on Troy. You can't be seriously expecting all countries to make shows according to the diversity in America. The world is bigger than that, you know."
tt11301642,"I don't remember ever watching a show from Turkey, so I didn't know what to expect. Not only is the story captivating, but the acting is top notch, world-class, and what's more, it's not ""just a show"", it actually has a high artistic value.It's probably just me that I'm a little weird but the show also made me laugh to tears a couple of times. It's not intentionally funny, but there are dialogues that are so realistic and, even if delivered in an angry way, are painful and funny just like life is."
tt11301642,"As a Greek I can relate to both modern and traditional aspects of contemporary Turkey. It was not much different here 60-70 years ago. But I couldn't expect to be confronted with such a magnetising masterpiece that I couldn't let off, watching all 8 episodes in one go. The actors are brilliant without exception, camera is partially silently shocking, images captured are impregnated in a spectator's head, the story will bring tears to your eyes but most important: not one character is good or bad. They are all both good and bad, making them exceptionally human.So, who is this director? Who are these actors? Why can't we have more from them?"
tt11301642,"This is the first time for me to write a review for a turkish series as a turk. I didn't want it to end. So captivating, real and sincere. It's a perfect look to the country's current problems, perfect characters&acting. The cast is amazing but I have to say, Öykü Karayel is something else.. I hope this series can be a mirror to the ones who need it in my country.."
tt11301642,"The first frame of the show already grabbed me like a magnet. The cinematography, the music score, the acting, the screenplay, the interesting details of EVERYTHING. Easily a perfect combination. The show is an experience from the get go.Berkun Oya has brushed his magic wand once again and transcends everyone into his world. We need more of these shows."
tt11301642,A must watch. The actings are tremendous. The stereotypes are so perfectly executed. Makes you laugh and cry. Just an incredible drama.
tt11301642,"English ReviewLet us remember that ethos is the common way of life or behavior adopted by a group of individuals who belong to the same socio-cultural group.This is precisely the essence of this Turkish miniseries that, starting from the stories of Meryem (Öykü Karayel) -a Muslim girl devoted to her brother and his family-, her psychotherapist Peri (Defne Kayalar) and her supervisor, Gülbin ( Tülin Ózen), opens and enriches the panorama, linking them with other characters, configuring a choral drama that basically rests on the oppositions and contrasts between pairs of ethos: that of lower-middle-class religious people and that of upper-middle-class lay people and illustrated, to which is added a gender perspective about the relationship between men and women within each one.Another constant among the characters is their difficulty in communicating (difficulty that transcends ethos) and the reasons for this difficulty. The tone of the dialogues at times produces a certain strangeness and is surreal.In various ways, as many as its characters, the series travels serenely (although not without violence, in some cases) the attempt to overcome these difficulties, conditioning and traumas.At times psi drama, at times family drama, Ethos... at times appeals to a strange poetry, a beautiful photograph and a soundtrack that uses themes from romantic movies."
tt11301642,"Does daily life of ordinary people worth watching? This show is realistic, hands down. Any Turkish person can see that those characters are everywhere; those are the types of people we see, we love and even be. But being ""overly"" realistic is really a qualification for a show to be good? I mean tv shows and movies are kind of the things we watch in order to escape from boring reality for a moment; so if reality was worth of watching, we would watch people around oursevles, not fictional stories on tv. So this show clearly managed to portray realistic people so well, but it also managed to portray the boringness of our ordinary lives SOOO well."
tt11301642,"Finally something so fresh so true so honest . It's what's happening in the world right now and I love the dialogue, Everything is top quality"
tt11301642,"Just wow. This show might be one of the best series Ive ever watched. It is realistic and captivating at the same time. The acting, production and the cinematography was above my expectation. And of course above the Netflix standards. So good!"
tt11301642,.. with brilliance in acting and writing and engaging music. Very artful.. I liked how the series reflect the clash between the west and east culture..
tt11301642,"This series is absolutely flawless. It is really rare to see a movie or a TV show which is excellent in every aspect of it. Well, this is the case of Ethos. Acting is superb. Characters are extremely well crafted, so as the screenplay. Scenes that seem irrelevant end up making sense few episodes later. Every character is contradictory and captivating in its own way. Cinematography is superb. And above all, the attempt to show the clash between relgion vs. secularism, tradition vs. modernity etc. is so well made that you don't really have an answer about what's the best path for a person or a country. Both ways are complicated (as we all are as human beings).
And despite it deals with very heavy and deep issues, it wraps it all with a layer of humour in a way that makes you feel more simpathy for the humanity"
tt11301642,"Huge Gaps at the turkish society, and for sure at many other countries.
Each time I watch an episode I feel I am there, I so understand each one of them!!
Acting is fabulous, frames and shots so beautiful, every story puzzled so well.
ART, ART,ART..... thank you"
tt11301642,"Do you want to be more knowledgable on Turkey? Watch this series. A deep humanitarian story, excellent acting, universal questions, beautifully told!"
tt11301642,"Started off well, good acting direction and original settings but proved to be predictable mostly and too stretched out, could have been done in 5 episodes not 8.Also so relentlessly gloomy. Trust me Istanbul is not full of misery as this series suggests.The direction is influenced by Nuri B Ceylan with the beautiful set up still scenes but like Ceylan it suffers from over long scenes.Overall good show great acting but too many contrived scenes, too many coincidences to help move the plots rather than character driven.Better than most netflix but a long way from being a masterpiece"
tt11301642,"I really liked this series, and in my opinion Öykü Karayel's acting was something else. she killed it... so proud of you! Öykü 👑"
tt11301642,I am totally disappointed after great first 2 episode. There is too many coincidence which makes you expect too many surprises but serie go on with useless dialogues untill the end.
tt11301642,"Painfully realistic, unexpectedly smart and beautifully captured. A Tv show that brilliantly portrays life. All of this done in an artful manner with which we are only once in a while honored by."
tt0405094,"I am still quite speechless. Overwhelmed by how utterly compelling the story was and by how emotive the acting story was. Floored by the unbelievably great character development. This film is close to perfect. It is a spiritual cousin to 2004's magnificent Downfall and shares a lot of similarities with Paul Verhoeven's stunning Black Book from last year, not just because these films share two actors. This multi-faceted character driven masterpiece really is as good as it's hype says.Sebastian Koch in particular absolutely shines. He is one of the best international actors working today and he follows the brilliance of his role in Black Book with the lead here. With his bohemian, dishevelled good looks and brilliant charisma, he's the best German-speaking actor since Bruno Ganz. But he is far from the only good actor in this movie, Ulrich Mühe as the State Security (Stasi) agent whose task it is to monitor Koch's suspiciously free thinking playwright, brings another near perfect performance to the movie. Agent Wiesler initially appears to the audience as the polar opposite of Koch's character. With his grey button down clothing, closely cropped hair and consistently emotionless face he symbolises everything about the overbearing untrusting Socialist government of East Germany that is wrong. He could easily have remained that character throughout the whole film but he becomes the surprising emotional centre of the story and the line between heroes and villains is significantly shifted (something which extends to the supporting cast as well. Truth be told there are probably only two characters in this film whom I didn't have to rethink my opinion of). Weisler reveals himself as a lonely, isolated man who risks his entire career as his attitude to his subject changes from one of mistrust to one of near-adoration. There is an undeniable link between the two characters even though they never share a single scene and Georg Dreyman (Koch) doesn't even find about Wiesler until the last 10 minutes of the movie, which leads us up to what should go down as one of the greatest endings in cinema history. Just thinking about the final spoken lines brings the tears to my eyes.As I said, without a doubt one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. And as much as I adore Pan's Labyrinth, this one really did deserve it's Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year. An absolute masterpiece."
tt0405094,"I saw this film in its North American premiere in a packed theater at the Toronto Int'l Film Festival this past week and was pleased to be part of a standing ovation at the end for the director and star, who were both on hand.""The Lives of Others,"" set in East Germany not long before the fall of the Berlin Wall, tells the moving story of a police investigator forced to confront himself and the work he does. In a society poisoned by secrecy, fear and the abuse of power, a number of the movie's characters -- artists, actors, writers -- must look deep inside and decide what they are made of; none more so than the investigator.This is a movie that took me to a place and time that felt very authentic, for a tale that was very satisfying.Ulrich Muhe, who plays the investigator, is mesmerizing, and the young director is to be applauded for this, his first full-length film. Some have compared ""The Lives of Others"" to Coppola's ""The Conversation"" but the two have completely different story arcs and are only superficially similar.Both my companion and I felt this was our favorite of the six films we had a chance to see at the festival."
tt0405094,"I wonder why there has been so little written and publicized about this movie. This should be seen in every country and its merits trumpeted from the skies.It starts off slowly and the locale is the former East Germany, inhabited by 16 million people who are being spied upon relentlessly by their secret police. In this very real world of the Berlin Wall, there are many Stasi, 90,000, overseeing the populace, aided and abetted by hundreds of thousands of informants. Many of these snitches were blackmailed or other pressures exerted (threats to children and loved ones) and a few obliged voluntarily.What is truly amazing is that this is Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's directorial debut, and he maintains a masterful hand throughout and keeps the story and the tension rolling from the first scene of interrogation which is filmed back and forth between a tape educating new Stasi as to interview techniques and to the actual cell itself where it was recorded.The movie circles around three main characters and there is a wider circle of the powerful who pull the puppet strings for a variety of reasons which become clear as the movie unfolds.First is Georg Dreyman, a playwright on the verge of celebrating his 40th birthday. Sebastian Koch, a tall,handsome actor dressed in writerly rumple, shares an apartment with his actress girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), and exists within the strictures of the state-sponsored theatre. He is a decent man, and tries to win support for his blacklisted friends.For reasons that become quite clear, Dreyman falls under suspicion and the whole sophisticated Stasi spying system comes into play in the era of 1984. His whole apartment is bugged and every sound is monitored.The man in charge of all this is Captain Gerd Wiesler,(Ulrich Mühe). Ulrich's performance is nothing short of stunning. He starts as an almost robotic presence, dressed in gray, he almost disappears into every scene he's in. But one detects a clear intelligence in his bright eyes, the only part of him that's alive. Captain Wiesler lives in a non-descript arborited apartment, much like himself. He squeezes his food onto a plate from a tube.But the captain starts to awaken slowly as he listens surreptitiously on the state of the art equipment secreted in the attic of Dreyman's building. He starts to fall in love with the couple and then pressure from above is brought to bear on him to dig for the dirt in Dreyman's life.And he is in a dilemma now, as he is drawn further and further into the life of Dreman and his girlfriend.I won't throw spoilers down. Suffice to say is that the story is enthralling right down to the very last frame. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable and the world of East Germany meticulously drawn with the viewer respected enough to find his or her own emotional path through the plot.The ending is truly one of a kind. So right and true that I was left nodding, it was the only one possible.A must see, I will sing the praises of this film to all I know. 10 out of 10 from me. Right up there in my top 50 of all time. I find it so disappointing that these movies don't get wider release AND compete for an Oscar in the best picture of the year and not just for best foreign film. Now there's a heretical thought!"
tt0405094,"After seeing the outstanding Pan's Labyrinth, I could not understand how anything could beat it to the Oscar for Best Film, let alone the accolade of Best Foreign Film. That was until I saw The Lives of Others.Putting it simply, this is the best film released in years. The framework of the story surrounds a Stasi officer who is assigned to monitor a writer and his actress girlfriend considered loyal to East German regime. That is all I am prepared to reveal because this film operates on so many levels that I wouldn't know where to begin. On the surface this can be enjoyed as a taut drama but essentially it is a study of the human condition and the capacity for compassion and humanity exists in even the most inhumane people. All of this is shot against the backdrop of the greys and browns of communist East Germany.As a film it is virtually flawless. The three central performances are nothing short of electric, with particularly Ulrich Muhe giving one of the greatest leading man performances since Al Pacino in The Godfather. None of this would be possible without a brilliant script and exemplary direction, that brings the characters to life extracting the best out of the actors. The result is no words are wasted, and every scene is relevant and expertly conceived. This manages to explore deep issues without being turgid, is moving without being draining and remains gripping and entertaining without being superficial.In summary, this is film-making at its finest. It is the sort of movie that you'll go down on bended knee and pay homage to the inventor of cinema, because it is films like this that cinema was created for. You'll forgive a year of tedious sequels and cash cows, for the one day that films like this get released.10 out of 10 is too modest."
tt0405094,"I do agree with all the other positive comments, and just need to add that this is the very first movie about the former GDR I saw that is not something like a comedy. Flicks like ""Sonnenallee"" or ""Good bye Lenin"" definitely were great and funny, but unconsciously left myself (a West German) with the impression that the GDR has been a sort of ""Mickey Mouse State"" full of stupid but charming characters, not really to be taken seriously. After seeing ""Das Leben der Anderen"" this impression shifted quite a bit: there actually was suffering, killing desperation and a terribly claustrophobic atmosphere behind that wall. This might well be the most realistic depiction of the dark side of the former East Germany. Thanks to the Producers, actors and director for making this movie. 10 out of 10."
tt0405094,"East Berlin, November 1984. Five years before its downfall the GDR seeks to maintain its power with the help of a merciless system of control and observation. When Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz puts loyal Stasi-Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler on to the famous writer Georg Dreymann and his girlfriend Christa Maria Sieland who is a famous actress herself, he expects career advancement for himself. For most important politicians are responsible for this ""operative act"".What Wiesler did not expect: the intimate view on the world of the ones he's observing changes the snitch as well. Looking at ""the life of the others"" makes him aware of the beggarliness in his own life and enables access to a so far unknown world of love, free thinking and speaking he is hardly able to elude. But the system can't be stopped anymore and a dangerous game, which destroys the love of Christa Maria Sieland and Georg Dreymann and Wieslers present existence begins. Until the fall of the wall each of them has paid a big price. After that a whole new world begins.My personal opinion - though it doesn't count that much - is that this one a an absolute Must See. I can hardly remember such an intelligent and moving German movie especially not including the whole topic of GDR history and the dealing with it. I think this is the first German movie which shows this system as it used to be (which has been confirmed by several contemporary witnesses) and not turns it and its people into comedy though there have been several good ones, of course."
tt0405094,"This film utterly blew me away. Full disclosure: I'm a German born (Munich born) German-American who left Germany in 1986, before the wall came down. I cannot describe the feeling I felt as the last few words were spoken on the screen. I could not look at the subtitles ( a habit of speaking two languages ) because my eyes were so full of tears. I cannot tell you how I was so sorry I did not experience the wall coming down. This film healed a wound that may have been left by the nightmare years of 1938-1945, my own great uncle being a Nazi war criminal, convicted in Nuremberg in 1946. Yes, we are mensch too. We have the potential for greatness (of character) in spite of our history. Thank you Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, for giving me back half of my lost soul in this single ""es ist für mich"". I am reminded again that the difference between ourselves and beasts is that we have a choice."
tt0405094,"""Who knows the secrets of the human heart?"" Col in The Crying Game WhenI saw 2006's Oscar winning Departed, I was satisfied it could be the best picture of the year; then I saw Pan's Labyrinth and thought it imaginatively superior; then I saw Lives of Others, the Oscar choice for best foreign film, and I knew it was the globe's best film of the year, no argument.Lives of Others is what all movie making should strive to be: interesting characters, thrilling plot, superb acting, and thematic weight. It's set in East Berlin, 1984, five years before the Wall's fall and Gorbachev's ""glasnost"" and still felling the tremors of Nazism, in this case the Stasi, a government agency similar to the SS. Capt. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muehe), a Stasi teacher and coldly efficient information gatherer, surreptitiously watches playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) to get compromising details that would damn Dreyman and open the romantic way for the culture minister, Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme). Oddly for an artist, Dreyman is loyal to socialism, so it is through Sieland that the information must come.The dramatic hub of this absorbing intrigue is the growing affection Wiesler gains for the actress and coincidentally the underground freedom movement, mostly as it is represented by artists and their friends. While his efficiency is amply evident in his cool detachment, similar to that of Rafe Fiennes in Schindler's List and Serg Lopez in Pan's Labyrinth, his humanity seeps out at the edges as he becomes vicariously involved in the artists' lives. First-time director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck misses not a beat in slowly revealing the hearts of all his principals while he creates a plot remarkably interesting for a character-driven piece.Few films could mine the rich conflict between the totalitarian state and artists who yearn for freedom of expression, between the loyalties of friends and lovers and the crushing exigency of survival. Lives of Others shows how difficult it is to watch others' lives unfold and not be drawn to their passion. It's rough out there: No other film of 2006 showed that cliché better. Here's looking at you, best film of the year."
tt0405094,"The story presents an era of total surveillance where anything not in line with the will of the party leaders is punished. Arguments do not exist, just the use of power. I think the story is valid. However it only reflects how people from the West can imagine, interpret and understand life in East Germany. During watching this film I had ambivalent feelings. Ulrich Mühe's performance really gives an authentic example of a Stasi officer and gives us a real feeling what the totalitarian system means. However I think the film lacks authenticity in some sense. Only those feel this subtle lack who have lived in an Easter European country. As a verification I guessed which actor has grown up in East Germany and which not. Then I checked their biographies that 90% confirmed my guesses. Those who have not grown up in East Germany only act. Those who lived in the totalitarian system really give us the authenticity. In summary, I think this is a very good film and the only I know of that exposes the surveillance of totalitarian systems. The performance of Ulrich Mühe as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler alone make this film worth seeing. For those who might be interested in the topic I recommend reading the book Celestial Harmonies: A Novel from Péter Esterházy and its second part (Celestial Harmonies: A Novel (P.S.)). In film you could watch any film from Krzysztof Kieslowski, Péter Gothár or Péter Bacsó."
tt0405094,"The first scene is amazing : you're watching a STASI class, where an interrogatory is meticulously analyze and deconstructed with a scientific method : if the person calms down after a while, she's lying, if she tells the exact same story twice, she's guilty... After this introduction to the method, we're about to watch its application. But unfortunately, watching the live of the others without interfering their live isn't that easy. And the cold Stasi agent will share empathy for his future victims.The way the inhuman agent (greatly plays by Ulrich Mühe) slowly becomes an anonymous hero ( he'll stay a serial number to the end, hidden in the shadows of more brightly people) to the contact of passion, love and art (music, theater and literature), symbolized by the couple he's suppose to watch, is very convincing and greatly develops. The direction of the movie is sober and matured, the actor are all good, and the script is clever enough to give an impression of realism to the all story. For all this ""objectiv"" reasons, this movie is definitely a good movie, and you leave the theater with the impression of having watch a serious piece of art of quality. But still, you wondering... If it was so good, why haven't you really been moved by the story, why this indifference toward the characters, why have you watch it with so little passion ? Of course, the theme, the period and the atmosphere of the film appeals sobriety, it's voluntary made that way. Right, but still, you can't help having the impression that something is missing to this movie, that this lack of passion doesn't necessarily have to move from the characters to the spectators, that the description of a cold and sad age doesn't have to be manufactured that way. In fact, it's madness this film lacks : it's missing a surprising event that wakes the spectator from the monotony of a ""interesting"" feature. Of course, this could have broke the harmony and unity of the movie, and make another ""Black Book"" instead of a so ""well done"" piece of art, but at least, you wouldn't have the impression of watching a nearly scholar movie, made by a good student, who gives you everything you're waiting for in a German movie about the STASI setting in 1984, and doesn't really leave any room to surprise."
tt0405094,"I've been taking German lessons for about 2 months now, and since movies were great in helping me learn English language I'm always looking for German films to watch (as well as German music to listen to) in order to educate my ears.Anyway, I went to this place where I get all sort of rare movies and this one caught my attention... and I had no idea it got the Oscar for foreign language film this year! So I watched it without prejudice and... what did I find? A MASTERPIECE! This is the kind of movie that gets your attention from the first moment, and makes you interested in understanding the characters' psyche, which is very varied: you have the idealistic good guys, the idealistic bad guys, the people that broad their minds understanding that no political dogma is better than individual freedom, etc. And even though the movie has very tough moments it is all so well done and presented with such a good taste that in the end you feel some sort of relieved.In this present day, when the ghost of authoritarian regimes still fly over our heads (in my country we're getting closer and closer to that reality), this movie will make you think about how important love, life and freedom are.A must see!"
tt0405094,"Memories of the 70's and 80's visits in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) flood my mind while watching this film. Some are revolting, some comical and others are frightening. As a student of German, I visited the GDR several times to see pen pal friends. I remember one friend looking around and whispering to me in the S-Bahn - just in case one of the many ""IM's"" (unofficial workers of the Stasi) was listening in.I visited a representative of a magazine for western countries about the GDR and spent one memorable weekend sightseeing with her. Near the end of my visit, she asked me if I would work for them regularly by writing my opinion of ""GDR Review"" and its suitability for readers in the West. I would be paid in GDR money to use during further visits. After politely refusing this ""offer"" (""The police at home might not like it!""), I always had a sneaking suspicion that that was an attempt by the Stasi to recruit me.Years later I applied to see my ""Stasi File"". I will never forget the feeling deep inside me when I read in it: ""..is not suitable for our use due to his apparent connection to the police in his homeland."" The beautiful, friendly lady in Dresden had been a Stasi informer all the time! All of my visits to the GDR and the people I visited were listed in that file. For me ""The Lives of Others"" is an authentic representation of that totalitarian state. I am glad that those times have ended. Congratulations on a well deserved Oscar!"
tt0405094,"Holy cow! What a terrific movie! I am a voting member of the Academy (actor's branch) so I get all the films for free. I've seen everything---60 films. This was one of the last 3 films that I saw---because I was completely unfamiliar with the title. This film slowly gripped me, but by the end, the grip was merciless. The lead actor, who should be doing The Life Story Of Peter Jennings, was wonderful. Everybody was terrific. Congratulations to the writers for their perfect structure---and to the director for his flawless storytelling---and his eliciting of top performances from his actors. How well cast it was. But now I'm totally bewildered. Why haven't I heard anything about this film? Where was this film at the Golden Globes? I haven't even seen any reviews about it. Nothing! What's going on? I'm very active in the film business. I follow this stuff. This film (that I never heard of) took me by surprise as no other film has ever done. Note to the IMDb: This is not a spoiler. Jesse Vint III"
tt0405094,"Brilliant. East Berlin, 1984. The Cold War is still raging and the communist bloc does not trust its own citizens. A Secret Police agent is tasked with conducting surveillance on a writer and his lover. Over time, rather than being coldly distant, he finds himself being absorbed by their private lives...A great examination of life in East Germany during Communist rule, and how empathy can overcome fascism. Perfect ending.Great performances all round, especially from the three main actors - Martina Gedeck, Ulrich Muhe and Sebastian Koch.Well deserved its Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 2007, and should have been nominated for more than just that."
tt0405094,"In the very first minutes of The Lives of Others, the unassuming Captain Gerd Wiesler (Muhe) sits in a small office interrogating a prisoner of the East German Stasi. He records his progress on tape and within hours Wiesler exhausts his prisoner to the point of confession, The tape stops; Wiesler is in a classroom teaching pupils at the university how to do the same. Within those first minutes we get a strong impression of his character; calculated, reserved and above all meticulous. It's those traits along with his dedication to Communism that make him a perfect surveillance man, at least according to Grubitz (Tukur) his supervisor.After attending a show by the popular playwright Georg Dreyman (Koch), Wiesler and Grubitz take an interest in the internationally acclaimed artist. A nationalist, a pro-Communist and loyal to the government; he must be up to no good figures the curious Wiesler. With the coaxing of the Minister of Culture (Thieme), Wiesler sets up a surveillance operation in the attic of Dreyman's apartment complex and places bugs throughout his abode. It is only after weeks of listening does Wiesler realize the Minister has an interest in Dreyman's mistress Christa (Gedeck). Grubitz sees room for advancement if they manage to find dirt on the playwright but Wiesler becomes enveloped in the complex and intriguing lives of Dreyman and Christa. Wiesler even starts to participate quietly in the shadows, making decisions that could change the fate of all involved forever.The essence of The Lives of Others script is essentially political. The workings of the Stasi serve its own self-survival by becoming a tool of Ministers and party elites. What matters more isn't the innocence or guilt of those who commit crimes against the State but whether those under suspicion have the political clout to protect themselves. Those who don't have two remedies, arrest or suicide. It is in-fact a suicide that initiates Dreyman's disillusionment with the entire system and kicks the torrent of dramatics into high gear. That and Christa's abusive relationship with the Minister.Yet there's something much deeper and beautiful about the story than merely being a manifesto against big brother. The acting is so nuanced and superb that the characters become the focal point of audience emotional investment and story tension. Ulrich Muhe especially deserves praise as a foil to Sebastian Koch's Dreyman. Both become disillusioned but for opposite reasons. While Dreyman starts seeing the forest through the trees sort to speak, Wiesler starts seeing people as people instead of abstractions or obstacles of a Communist ideal.There was much ado about The Lives of Others winning Best Foreign Language film at the Academy Awards over the heavy favorite Pan's Labyrinth (2006). Both are beautifully rendered political parables with tenacious emotional strength yet while one has a sense of exhaustive grandeur and filigree, the other is muted, meticulous, and pensive in its plotting. While some may balk at the thought of a reticent thriller, The Lives of Others uses its less ostentatious style to its advantage as evidenced by the dark green mis en scene of Stasi HQ, the faded warmth of Dreyman's apartment and the sooty grays of the attic where Wiesler quietly listens."
tt0405094,"The story unravels nicely although a bit too slow for my taste. Yet I really like how the opening exposes the meticulous practice of the Stasi. The introduction of the characters Dreyman and Sieland is also nice, especially if, like me, you watch the movie without any prior knowledge toward this movie. The transition that Wiesler undergoes during the movie is portrayed nicely. This is even better because the movie uses less scene montages. The depiction of Grubitz's dangerous character through bits and pieces scattered along this movie is also nice. I like how Ulrich Muhe played the calm yet meticulous and then the affected version of Wiesler. Martina Gedeck also shows a good performance and went total on this movie. Sebastian Koch does well in completing this movie with his performance of quite an undecided character."
tt0405094,"Can you imagine a world where people are continuously spied on, where the police set up surveillance equipment in the attics, where even typewriters are registered and, in spite of this,a world accepting of refugees? I am not talking about science fiction. I am talking about real life, the real events that took place in East Germany before the Fall of the Wall.While I was watching 'The lives of others'I couldn't help comparing it to another film, 'Good Bye, Lenin'; both are widely applauded approaches to the recent history of East Germany. But I think one of them is definitely superior to the other; read on if you'd like to know which.Both films are German and were released more or less at the same time -around 2005- and they share factual accuracy and the atmosphere of that historical period, although the first one takes place mainly in the years before the Fall of the Wall and the second, in the years immediately after. Both films have a lot in common, such as an appealing theme, plausible dialogues, lots of moving scenes and convincing acting. In spite of sharing a common theme, they have different approaches, since 'The lives of others' shows the story of a playwright who is being spied on by 'the Party'. What is a cold relationship at the beginning of the story turns into sympathy, what seems love turns into treason, what should have been informing on somebody turns into respect and admiration. On the other hand, 'Good bye, Lenin!'is very innovative mainly because it has a large dose of comedy, which is remarkably powerful. When his mother suffers a heart attack and awakes from a coma seriously weakened, Alex, the main character has to pretend that nothing has changed, that East Berlin is the same as it was before the Fall of the Wall, because a great shock like that could cause her death, so there he goes doing the impossible to keep the 'status quo'. This situation leads to entertaining scenes and appealing dialogue. In addition, both films were recorded on set and on location -we can enjoy watching what Karl Marx Allee looked like almost thirty years ago.However, although both films portray our recent history very convincingly, I strongly recommend 'Good bye, Lenin!'because it is funny, moving and grabs your attention from the very first moment. And it can also make you think!"
tt0405094,"Remember Total Recall? The sci-fi movie about people who get memory implants? Looks like that just happened to the viewers of The Lives of Others (LOO) , who are now convinced they know all about the GDR.  It was always cloudy.  Everybody wore either a uniform or tasteful clothes in muted shades of gray, blue, or brown.  The streets were empty.  Only two kinds of people lived theredissident artists and police spies.  There was a major shortage of women.  Everyone spoke in a flat, lifeless way (flat and lifeless--in Berlin??).  Nobody ever wore red or put on ugly flowered polyester shirts, nor did they raise kids, go to bars, shop for cold cuts, play miniature golf, or listen to Elvis Presley.Of course, as soon as you think about this, you realize that the movie is not about a real country at all, but about one of those abstract, generic totalitarian dystopias1984 (Winston and Julia ratting on each other), Minority Report, bits of Star Wars (the slimy toad-monster molesting Princess Leah) and above all, THX 1138, with gray hairless people grimly marching along gray sunless corridors while security forces keep flawless records on everybody. In other words, LOO creates a montage of spliced, recycled images from sci-fi movies to implant a generic image of ""the totalitarian state"" in our minds as our ""memory"" of the GDR.If we accused the director of playing games with these images, he would probably respond disingenuously that he made a movie about a state of mind and not a historical documentary. Funny though how many people (to judge from the reviews) believe that now they know something about the GDR. Well, what's wrong with a false memory, as long as it's anti-communist?And on the subject of falsehoods, take a look at a little sleight of hand the director tries to pull:: 1) The protagonist is understandably unhappy about the suicide of his friend. 2) The GDR did stop publishing suicide statistics (actually even earlier than 1977, as is discussed in a 1972 Radio Free Europe research report that you can see online). 3) Before the GDR stopped publishing the figures, it had a very high rate, probably the second highest in Europe after Hungary. So far, so good, but now keep your eyes open as the rabbit is pulled out of the hat! So it logically follows that the communist regime caused the high suicide rate-- right? Wait a minute! This conclusion is a logical non sequitur and a misrepresentation of historical facts. The regions comprising the GDR (especially Saxony, Prussia, and Mecklenburg, with Brandenburg not far behind) already had some of the highest suicide rates in Europe as early as the period from the 1860s to the 1880s, when these data were first systematically made available. The rate in Saxony (think Dresden and Chemnitz) was consistently the highest in Europe throughout this period. But these historical and sociological facts might inconveniently interfere with the simple anti-communist message.Don't worry, I am not about to undertake the Herculean task of defending the GDRand indeed there was a lot not to like. But if you really want to know something about it, not just wallow in feel-good anti-Communism, see Goodbye, Lenin, an infinitely better movie than LOO. Two negative perspectives, but both of them more serious than LOO, are Jan Schutte's Abschied/Farewell: Brecht's Last Summer and Peter Kahane's The Architects, about a group of young urban planners. And try some GDR movies, many of which had a more critical and humorous edge than you might expect, such as Egon Gunther's Der Dritte, a comedy about a slatternly, feisty single mom and bus cleaner. Yes, ordinary working people actually existed, rode on buses, drank beer, ate cold cuts, went to jobs, raised kids, enjoyed sex, and stood up to their bosses (the chronic labor shortage allowed workers to be far less subservient at the workplace than the ""free"" and pathetically insecure American employee has to be). The subject of the relative autonomy and equality of women is way to big to get intoChrista-Maria's limp victim-hood was not typicalyou can check this out in Christel Lane's article on women in the GDR in Sociology, Volume 17, no. 4, November,1989.Bottom line on LOO: Don't believe everything you see; and you will see disappointingly little of the very attractive Sebastian Koch, whose talents are wasted in a glum and sexless part.."
tt0361748,"Aside from the Kill Bill's I have not seen any other Tarantino film. I heard this one was good and so I watched. It's great. From the opening scene you are mesmerized by Christoph Waltz's unnerving performance. He gets a lot of credit and rightfully so. Hans Lands is possibly one of the greatest movie villains of all time. There so many iconic moments and Tarantino demonstrates how normal dialogue scenes can become suddenly intense with words alone. Every actor gives it their all with Brad Pitt giving a memorable performance as well. This movie is worth watching just for its opening but it also has back to back quality scenes that are well shot and have excellent dialogue. The movie balances it's comedy with excellent dark moments reminding viewers that this is indeed a WW2 film. Overall, my favourite Tarantino film of the three I've seen and might be for some time. Worth watching for Christoph Waltz."
tt0361748,"In 1941 Nazi-occupied France, ""The Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) finds the Dreyfus family hidden by their neighbors. Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) escapes after her family is massacred. Meanwhile Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) has gathered 8 Jewish American soldiers to kill Nazis behind enemy lines. Their brutal scalping campaign instills fear among the Germans. Donowitz (Eli Roth) is even given a nickname ""The Bear Jew"" for brutally beating Nazis with a baseball bat. Then in June 1944, Shosanna has a new name and a theater. She catches the eye of German war hero Fredrick Zoller who wants a big premiere in her theater that will attract the biggest of Nazi leaders. It even attracts the Jew Hunter as well as the Inglourious Basterds.Christoph Waltz is great as the cold menacing well-mannered Nazi. He is completely engrossing in every one of his scenes. Every word he speaks is dripping with menace. His scenes are quiet and some of the most compelling parts of the movie. Then Quentin Tarantino has injected his brutal violence into this Jewish revenge fantasy. It is nothing less than audacious and uniquely original."
tt0361748,"There's a hunter called Hans Landa you should fear, if circumcision defines the way your men appear, on the surface quite polite, underneath riven with spite, carries a scar that lets you know of his career (or at least he will). But those un-helmeted can rejoice and be spurred, avenging evil come Inglorious Basterds, being led by Aldo Raine, with a remit to cause pain, several parts may disappear as things are sheared.Great dialogue, great direction, sublime performances and original in its depiction of a war picture that's been repainted a thousand times before, but seldom with such entertainment - Tarantino's best in my opinion."
tt0361748,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz! He has won just about every award for his performance in this film, and he deserves every single one of them.
Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo!
He is ULTRA polite with each one; and has supreme confidence in his scary, chilling, bold mannerisms.
All I can say is: ""You see this movie for Christoph Waltz's performance; all the rest is secondary""!"
tt0361748,"This is a perfect Tarantino movie. It's explosive and exciting while also deep and well thought out. It took me a minute to get used to reading so many subtitles because of the variety of languages used, but I think that's a quality that makes the movie even more enticing. It is incredibly well done and it had a hold of me from beginning to end. Fair warning for any Tarantino movie, be prepared for the gore and violence. It runs rampant throughout the movie, but it's kind of gratifying seeing it happen to the Nazis."
tt0361748,"That's what I thought, when I heard about the cast of Inglorious Basterds. And I'm both from Germany and into movies.That guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre TV series - and even there he didn't play the main parts. Obviously nobody ever noticed, what he's capable of. Now, thanks to QT, he got one shot to change that - and - let's put it this way - that was a bingo! He is the living proof of what a great caster Tarrantino is.By the way: I think it's a great privilege to watch the movie as a German - being able to understand everything. And the German dialog is written almost as good as the English.Now I could repeat, what many others have written here before. I'll put it short: Finally, QT is back."
tt0361748,"I had the PRIVILEGE of attending the UK premier of Inglorious Basterds this evening! Having seen the trailers i had high hopes but had doubts due to a string of self indulgent films (c'mon lets be honest, self indulgence is his tarantinos middle name)I was surprised to find though that he had pulled the cat out of the bag with this one. The film is rich with interesting dialogue, Perfect timed comedy with a dash of brutal assassination.The crowning glory of this film though lies with Christoph Waltz whom no fault or error can be found. He manages to create a real tension in the audience whilst remaining quite ""theatrical"" (couldn't think of a better word). He definitely deserved his prize at Cannes and is heading for an Oscar no doubt!!!! Hoping to see him in something again soon!"
tt0361748,"Once again, revenge is at the center of a Quentin Tarantino movie. This time a Jewish dirty dozen takes things on their own hands. Tarantino re-writes history and shortens WWII with a comic stroke that is as entertaining as it is vacuous. A fantasy that re-arranges some controversial historical points. Okay, it's a movie and as such it works for most of its two and a half hours. Christoph Waltz opens things up in the most promising way. The opening sequence is filled with a subtle but unbearable tension. Weltz amalgamates all the Nazi villains we have loved and hated in the movies into one glorious creation. (I will advise my countrymen to see it in its original multi-language version - the Italian version is another movie altogether. Some of the extra pleasures are in the dialog that, naturally, are not to be found in the Italian version) Brad Pitt, rapidly becoming one of the best character actors in the world, with a leading man's face and billing, is truly fantastic. Diane Kruger makes a credible Barbara Bouchet (one of Tarantino's muses from trash action Italian movies from the 70's) and the rest of the cast has some exquisite touches like Rod Taylor as Winston Churchill. Highly recommended for a Sunday afternoon."
tt0361748,"I can't imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than Quentin Tarantino's. (At least in his films) Inglourious Basterds is no different. We all know Tarantino, the guy who exploded on the scene in the early 90s with cult classics, such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Since, he has been a disappointment for some. Well, I am relieved to say, Tarantino has not lost his touch. He brings us his best since Pulp Fiction and thankfully so.We know the story, a WWII tale told only as Tarantino can. (Fictional of course) A war film hasn't been done like this before. Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine leads the Basterds in Nazi occupied France. Their goal - killin' Nazi's. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa plays a similar role on the other side. He's know as the ""Jew Hunter"" and goes about his business as ruthless as no other. The third sub story consists of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who witnesses the slaughter of her family. And she, of course, wishes to plot revenge on the Germans for her devastating lose. There actually is three stories here intertwining and connecting with each other. If you know anything about Tarantino or his films, this is nothing new for him.War has never been been so fun. The Basterds, are haunting, but at the same time, very funny, at times even hilarious. The dark comedy aspect play a big aspect in this as in many other Tarantino films. The entertainment and hilarity is led by Brad Pitt. I found him extremely funny and entertaining. I couldn't wait to see him on screen again. Even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. Also making great impressions were Mélanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz, who were tremendous. The film was filled with noteworthy performances.The story itself, has so many historical inaccuracies to even count, but so what? It isn't meant to be a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun with, as should we. The cinematography department deserves big props with beautiful vibrant colors highlighting the film. You've really got to love the last line in the film... but Pulp Fiction remains his masterpiece.Quentin Tarantino among all other things, is an entertainer. WWII, is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino some how manages to make it fun. Inglourious Basterds is a fun film, it's tremendously entertaining, shocking, dramatic, suspenseful, and funny at the same time. Jam packed with everything you look for in a movie, done with that certain Tarantino style, it's worth being checked out. It's time to experience for yourself what war is like through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino."
tt0361748,"Everything is forgiven because ""Inglorious Basterds"" is so entertaining and at the end of the day that'ìs what matters. I think it's a pity that certain critics, specially in Italy, are determined to transform this clever pulp director into some kind of god. Maybe, partly, because Tarantino has been very clever, elevating some of the Italian pulp movies of the 60's and 70's to a sort of cult status. Italy is very grateful for that, he's rewarded with interminable praise. I fear that's the wrong approach, it's also confusing. He makes popcorn movies, brilliantly. The characters have never anything important to say, Burger King, Superman, that's the extent of its depth and I think he's tapping into a society that's getting shallower and shallower with every passing year. But, if I'm mentioning this instead of talking about all the great things I could be saying about his movie is because there is a strange force trying to brain wash me into believing that Tarantino is the most important influence in movies since time immemorial. No, he's a great director of inconsequential fun movies. I consider myself a fan and I intend to see all his future movies. This one has some wonderful touches, winking at other movies by John Sturges, Robert Aldrich etc. Brad Pitt and in particular Christoph Waltz give wonderful performances. Waltz is at the center of my favorite scenes in the film. Enjoy this movies for what it is and not for what critics are saying it is. You'll enjoy it even more that way."
tt0361748,"Amazing film, has some really funny scenes but also really intense one. Great dialogue as you expect from Tarantino movies and superb acting especially from Cristoph Waltz. I would recommend this to everyone."
tt0361748,"Brad Pitt sticks his index finger in Diane Kruger's leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants. Funny, horribly so. The invented yarn takes ""The Dirty Dozen"" for a ride and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other movies. Lots of fun. Even ""Paris when it sizzles"" is mentioned in a delightfully organic piece of dialog. I was thrilled by Christoph Waltzer's character and by his sensational performance. Brad Pitt creates a true original. I love the actor's lack of vanity. There's a quirk in the character that is pure Brad Pitt. Tarantino visits a new universe but. fortunately, his hand. his brain and his heart are visible all over the place."
tt0361748,This is a movie that you can watch many times and enjoy.
tt0361748,"It just goes to show how wrong you can be. I had not expected to like this film. I was disappointed by both the Kill Bill films (although i preferred the second) and Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double-bill release). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction and think that Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature piece of film-making - technically his most superior - including the last great performance elicited from Robert De Niro. Since then it seems to me while his films have been okay (i haven't hated them) he has been treading water in referential, reverential, self-indulgent juvenilia.Then i read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and i hated it! Sure it had some typical QT flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were a couple of great characters. But on page it was more juvenile rubbish, largely ruined by the largess of the uninteresting Basterds of the title. It made me seriously contemplate not seeing the film. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I only changed by mind when i had the opportunity to see the film with a Tarantino Q&A following in London. I figured it would be worth enduring to hear him in Q&A as i know from interviews how entertaining he can be in person.So little was i prepared for the sheer exuberant fun and brilliance of Inglourious Basterds.Easily Mr Tarantino's best work since Jackie Brown it is a triumph.Yes the references are there but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes Eli Roth is stunt casting but he works fine, with little to do but look aggressive, and does nothing to hurt the film as i had feared. While i admired Mr Tarantino for using stuntwoman Zoe Bell as herself in Death Proof in order to amp-up the exhilaration of the major stunt scene her lack of any acting ability in a key role was a problem for the film. The same could be said of Tarantino's own appearances in several films, especially Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, which Tarantino wrote.What really makes this work is how BIG it is. The spaghetti western vibe to much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully over the top without descending too far into the cartoon quality of Kill Bill. The violence is so big. The audacity so big. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers the Hitler moment and Pitt's performance bothered me but in the context of the film they are hilarious. Pitt is actually brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is Mifune's blustering samurai in Yojimbo, he is Robards Cheyenne from Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a very James Coburn vibe to him, and of course a suitably Lee Marvin edge.Christoph Waltz (who i did not previously known) and Melanie Laurent (who i first noticed in a brilliant French-language British short film by Sean Ellis) are sensational and i expect to see both used a lot more in the future. Tarantino has clearly not lost his eye for casting, which seemed to desert him in Death Proof. Waltz is equally large in his performance. Chilling, yet theatrical. He is Fonda from OUATITW, Van Cleef from Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is suitably Cardinale innocence but tough, a fighter. They both dazzle here.That every member of the cast gets the fun to be had from what they are doing while not indulging themselves in just having fun and trying to get laughs helps tremendously. The laughs - and there are loads - come organically. Only Mike Myers comes close to tipping the wink and pushing it too far but his scene is reigned in just enough - with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender who seems pulled directly from the mold of Attenborough's Great Escape leader.All the actors shine and Tarantino throws in wonderful flourishes, but ones that work with the story. The introduction of Schweiger's Hugo Stiglitz is a riot. After a sensational slow-burn opening and a glorious intro to those inglourious Basterds the pace never lets up and over two and half hours flies by.It also looks beautiful, marking this as a return to real film-making rather than just self-indulgent silliness. The musical choices, as always, are inspired from Morricone on.The film is audacious and hilarious. After a summer when nearly every film has disappointed me it came as a huge surprise that the real fun and entertaining, but also involving and impressive film should be this one, when i would never have believed it from script form. Welcome back QT."
tt0361748,"Inglorious Basterds makes no apologies, asks for no forgiveness, it's a  no holds barred assault on the senses. Tarantino doesn't care if he  offends, if he steps all over stereotypes and clichés, this is film  making at it purest. It's great to see a film maker whose work clearly  isn't interfeared with by the powers that be. Tarantino is a master of  effortlessly cranking up immense tension and suddenly mixing it with  laugh out loud moments; you're not sure if you should be looking away  in disgust or rolling around laughing, either way it's a roller coaster  and one not to be missed! It's not for everyone, certainly if you're not a fan of Tarantino's style, this may be a little hard to swallow, but  never-the-less, it is a film which simply has to be seen. No self  respecting film fan should miss this. And the performance of Christoph  Waltz... Oscar don't you dare ignore him!!"
tt0361748,"...""Inglorious"" as our local theater decided to display its title on their marquee, minus the second word. It is terrific cinema.I don't hesitate to recommend this film to all but the over-squeamish. Let them never know what they're missing.I did hesitate to give it ten stars because of my experience of Tarantino's previous films. In every case, save ""Reservoir Dogs,"" they have improved with additional watching.So although I gave it ten stars, I did so reluctantly. It leaves me no ""up"" to go to.Yes Christoph Waltz is the Nazi we've all imagined the worst to be. He is cultured, sophisticated, suave and most sadistic, the kind of man who can make a glass of milk a threat and who puts out his cigarette abruptly in a strudel, grinding it into the whipped cream as if he were grinding his heel into a victim.To understand Tarantino's films, you need only have a sense of dialogue, color and pacing. The colors are as bright as necessary and when necessary, brighter yet. In the French farmhouse of the opening scene, they are muted and dark, but excessively so. Outside a brilliant sun is shining, but in the one room of the house, everything is bathed in shadows and black.It is a brilliant setting for an interrogation by Waltz, as the ""Jew Hunter"" of the SS, who dangles his host French farmer over the precipice of revealing what he cannot reveal numerous times, then pulls him back with obsequious lines of friendship and understanding.A second sadistic German, well-played by August Diehl, later functions as important actor in the final plot twist. Diehl's Nazi Major, who has an ear for German accents, is almost as good as Waltz....almost.Film classes will study much from this movie. They should look lovingly at the superb pacing. Tarantino knows just how long to draw out a scene, building suspense in the manner of Hitchcock, then at just the breaking point, suddenly coming to a resolution.For color, look for a final shot at a French Theater, where its secretly Jewish proprietor is staging a surprise for the upper reaches of Nazi leadership.We see her, played by Melanie Laurent, awaiting the hated German dignataries who will arrive for a film preview of the latest Deutsch film masterpiece, a propaganda piece about a German hero and his dubious accomplishments.Laurent is framed on a balcony, reflected in the glass mirrors of the gorgeous theater, her red lips and low cut dress reflecting everywhere the intensity of her designs on her guests. It is a single shot that would be worth an entire film.There are thankfully many more such images, many more paced scenes of exquisite dialog and suspense.In short, see it. I'm sure you'll see it again and again."
tt0361748,"Very entertaining, that's for sure. Great little moments ""inspired"" by other movies. ""The Guns Of Navarone"", ""Operation Crossbow"" and a myriad of 70's B exploitation Italian movies. Tarantino is certainly clever and knows how to use the camera but then, I have to say it, nothing. The childish ""divertimento"" dressed in smart ass dialog remains there. The entertainment value is, perhaps, the most one should expect from a movie but it seems a damn shame that such a talent should be put at the service of something so one dimensional. I can't help but remember Ernst Lubitch's ""To Be Or Not To Be"" that was also a comedy with remarkable, inventive dialog but it also had so many other layers that ""To Be Or Not To Be"" after 70 years still resonates with whoever has seen it. Christoph Waltz is terrific and Brad Pitt is always great fun to watch but the experience is purely epidermic in spite of some truly gruesome moments. Am I expecting oranges from an apple tree? If that's so forget what I've just said and run to meet Tarantino's basterds."
tt0361748,There are a lot of ambiguities in this film)Marvel 45 years old) it is quite possible to spend an evening and watch for 1 time.
tt0361748,"You should hear the Italian critics talking about Tarantino and ""Inglorious Bastards"". They run out of superlatives. One of them last night actually shouted ""Tarantino is my God"". Wow! I, personally, suspect that Tarantino is the result of a generation of TV and bad (now cult) exploitation movies. I enjoy him, don't get me wrong, but I'm not shouting miracle when I still have ""The Great Escape"", for instance, so fresh in my mind. ""Inglorious Basterds"" more than any of the other Tarantino films is all about appearances. There is nothing underneath other than references to other movies. Nothing wrong with that in fact I like it but I refuse to treat Quentin Tarantino as a sort of Deity. I can't buy it. I think he should be placed exactly where he belongs among the best of his kind but what kind is that? Never mind, it works. Italian critics who are so prepared to destroy their own - you should read some of the reviews for ""Baaria"" - are prepared to fall to their knees in front of Tarantino. This are the same critics that last year, the year of ""Milk"", ""Slumdog Millionaire"" ""Edge Of Heaven"", The Wrestler"" etc, gave the David de Donatello Award for best picture to ""Grand Torino"" I want to make sure that I'm making my point clearly. ""Inglorious Bastards"" is a terrific comedy with most of Tarantino's trademark tricks in place. You'll have a great time with Brad Pitt and an incredible Christoph Waltz as the ultimate Nazi villain but don't expect a masterpiece as declared by some critics. That kind of review damages the film and me the spectator. It forces something on me. As if I was suppose to feel the same otherwise there is something wrong with me. No. I liked it, I recommend it for what it is. Period."
tt0361748,"An fun, engrossing, beautifully crafted piece of nonsense, the likes of which we hadn't seen in a long long time. The silliness of the story is marvelously camouflaged with great dialogue and some superb performances. Christoph Waltz must be thinking already about his acceptance speech. What a performance! The civilized monster, polyglot, refined and deadly. He gets us going from the first, sensational scene. Brad Pitt is also wonderful. Was he putting a Mussolinni chin while impersonating (hilariously) an Italian? I thought so. His character's name sounds like Aldo Ray and I'm sure that's no accident. The film is full of movie references. Another character is named Fenek, as an homage to his 1970's sexpot, Edwige Fenech. What is already one of Tarantino's trademarks is his sure step along the most immediately recognizable bits of pop culture. He's clearly not a cultured man but a pop expert, king in a world where people get their news from TV, don't read, other than magazines and comics, etc. That's how it happens, to be in the right place at the right time. For better or worse this are Tarantino times."
tt0152183,"not exactly bill in peak form, but nonetheless a relic from the life a brilliant, sincere, intellectual mastermind who weaved tapestries of social commentary that provoked, intrigued, or just plain made you stand at attention.  it is all just a ride and with Hicks as conductor, you're sure to understand it all a little better.  you get a little bit of everything here on revelations. not all the best material is here, but like her always said ""i'm not a f'n jukebox, okay?""  To hear all the gems, pick up his 4 essential albums on rykodisc. you must just be inspired to squeegee open your third eye and see beyond the wool thats been draped down over you."
tt0152183,"Let me start by saying I think Bill Hicks is overrated. His narcissism is funnier than any joke he's ever had. His shows were a bizarre mutually parasitic circle jerk. Bill could feel like the messianic figure he saw himself as by spreading ""the truth"", and the audience got to feel superior to the rest of society because they ""got"" Bill's material. (What other choice did they have? Bill's set revolved around people not agreeing with him as being braindead) The problem with all of this is that Bill Hicks spoke on elementary social critiques. Bill and the rest of his cult show their hand as soon as they tell you that you don't ""get"" him (presumably because of your low IQ). If you think anything Bill Hicks talks about is deep or enlightening then I can only assume that you never thought about this stuff on your own. Nothing about his material is hard to grasp, so if you're telling me you have to be intelligent to get it, then you're just not all that smart yourself.The special is good. The editing is well done and Hicks brings up good points for those who haven't thought about them before. I never found myself laughing hysterically, but it's definitely funny at points. The cut scenes were campy but a nice touch, and his closing bit where he talks about life being a ride was really great. That being said, there is nothing here to ""get"" or go over your head. If you think you're intelligent because you understand Bill Hicks, I have bad news for you."
tt0152183,"How did it take me so long to come to Bill Hicks? I'd heard about him for years, but only until a DVD was released with a few of his specials, and suddenly his lucid, spot-on sarcastic observations grew on me almost immediately. He goes from JFK to Terminator 2 stunts done by cripples to 'happy LSD trips' to fundamentalists running the country, and there's rarely a bit where one doesn't just let out a whole lot of laughs. His delivery is a big part of it; he sometimes is in on the joke so much so that he has no other way than to make a goofy face after saying something that we know is ridiculous about something. He also shows himself to be totally, wondrously ruthless when it comes to any lack of intelligence in a group of people- or just individuals, can't hurt- and in entire ways of living, like people in advertising (""No joke, just kill yourselves."") But he's also just got a quick tongue, varying his voice and mannerisms, to fit the joke at the unexpected places. Even a bit that might run a little long, like his Goat-boy impersonation, has sparks of genius that are far greater than middling comics best stuff.I'm not entirely sure yet if he was a total genius or one of the 5 best comics ever like some have purported him to be. But on the evidence of Revelations and Relentless (and, even more-so, his half-hour One Night Stand appearance on HBO in 1990), he was a genuine talent, able to tackle all the big topics of the day and just in general, which makes the bulk of it last years on."
tt0152183,"""Revelations"" was my first Bill Hicks experience but unfortunately, one of his last performances. After viewing this video, Bill Hicks immediately became my favorite stand-up comedian. Probably because I share most of his views which were brilliantly expresses with his brutally hilarious humor. At times he gets a feverish intensity beyond typical humor and really makes you think about what he says whether you like it or not. What he said was more that just comedy club material, it had a meaning behind it. Maybe that's why, since his untimely death (cancer), he has been referenced and quoted by such people as the band Tool (on their 1996 ""Aenima"" album) and Author David Icke (in quite a few of his books). Half way through I started to wonder if this guy had any faith in humanity, but by the end his sincere closing remarks just might restore YOUR OWN faith in humanity."
tt0152183,"I watched all of the specials attached to Bill's Dec. 2004 DVD release, and I have to say, to see them in chronological order showed me one thing. Bill Hicks was a guy who needed focus, and as time went on, it was developing. The first 10 minutes of Revelations is funnier than his HBO half hour and Relentless combined. Not that those two weren't funny, but Revelations was focused, and he just kept pounding the audience with jokes. In his earlier days he tended to ramble, not knowing when to end a joke. As a comic, I can tell you that this is a hard thing to learn, and Bill was really getting there in Revelations. Had he survived cancer, we'd see him as a polished and brilliant comic today. Denis Leary may only be a footnote in comedy had Hicks lived on."
tt0152183,"This video captures Bill live in London, and is the last video he made before he died. He is on fire, ranting and raving about the hypocrisy that surrounds us leaving no sacred cows. Not too many people know of Bill, he died before making it really big. If however you ever want to know what all the fuss, that some of us make, is about him check it out. I swear you will not regret it."
tt0152183,"Along with Andy Kaufman and Steven Wright, Bill Hicks is one of the most redeeming factors of American comedy. Forget about your John Belushi's or Tim Allen's or Robin Williams, Hicks was the real deal and angry, sensitive, rip-roaringly funny, acerbic comedic talent of epic proportions. Hicks was no-holds barred comedy, trampling upon his audience with a barage of put-downs and come-back lines. Where as most comedians stop at the punchline, Hicks went that one step further and punched the punchline. A man full of contradictions: loved his mum and pap, but ruthlessly satirised them in his stand-ups; was full of venom and bile on stage, but was achingly sensitive and caring off; In short Hicks was a maestro.Revel in an all-out comedic assault and maybe you might get on the space ships too."
tt0152183,"Bill Hicks, the late prophet.  As a stand up comic he may not supply sitcom-style laughs every twelve seconds, but his act is the intellectual equivalent of reading twelve books. Bill Hicks opens our eyes and minds to the hypocrisy and ludicrousness of the world around us, when he presents some hard facts about alcohol versus drugs, the mind blowing statistics of alcohol induced death as opposed to death cause by virtually all other illegal drugs combined, the irony of anti marijuana campaigns followed by shameless beer commercials, the countless ways religions have strayed off of their paths to become nothing more than organized superstitions, and the list goes on. Study him, learn his words by heart, and realize how much better countries/governments/life could be if it made half the sense he does."
tt0152183,"Bill Hicks is brilliant. This is no exception. Sadly since its now ten years old it is dated but if you have any brain at all you can work past it. Its especially interesting to hear Bill's comments on George Bush Snr. The same comments that are being used now about Jnr?Well you should watch this, either you'll get it and love it or miss the point. It isn't a wild ride of none stop jokes, its a more thoughtful almost introspective comedy video. Almost sad in places, he doesn't look well.
I'm afraid I didn't pay for it, I downloaded it. Its worth buying if you can find a copy though and as soon as its on DVD i'll get me one!"
tt0152183,"The best comedian ever, in his last video before his untimely death. Bill shows the world what we are now missing. How this guy is better known here in Britain than in his home country, where he did most of his work still amazes me."
tt0152183,"This was Bill Hicks last recorded stand up routine performed at the London Dominion Theatre several months before his death in 1994.This is not vintage Hicks and I found his earlier routines to be funnier. Still you get to see Bill Hicks angry and misanthropic as he rails against the hypocrisy of the church going conservative right establishment in the United States.There are routines on JFK, the first Gulf War and pop stars of the time enjoying their 15 minutes of fame once they serviced Satan's tool. If he was alive I wonder what he would make of the continued success of Marky Mark Wahlberg. Hicks is spiteful towards marketing men and as always he talks about drugs.In his latter years Hicks enjoyed touring Britain where he found a willing audience with his free thinking brand of comedy. However this show lacked focus to me and some of the material was familiar as well."
tt0152183,Bill Hicks was the best comic of his generation and when i read from todays top comics (Bill Bailley for instance) dropping his name as an influence it makes me confident that Bills legacy will continue.The only problem i have with this performance is that i'm always hit with a tinge of sadness in his closing words. Quite ironically Bill is one of 'the good guys'he speaks about he himself one of those who stops to tell us not to live in fear that life is just a ride and cruelly as with the other truth-sayers that came before nature robbed us of him!!! RIP Bill
tt0152183,"Yeah he was so great telling everyone what was wrong with the world but where were the solutions on how to fix it.You know if I wanted to get someone's insight on the world it would not be from a drunk ,junkie .full of hate.If you think he is so great you should have been in Germany in the 1930's you would have loved this asshole to.You know what is strange is you have a mindless dick with both feet in the grave and he is telling other people to kill themselves maybe he wanted some company?A hatefull asswipe to the very end.In the the words of a funny character good riddance to bad rubbish!Enjoy hell."
tt0152183,"Over the last two years, four different Bill Hicks shows have been released on DVD in North America. Of the four, Revelations, filmed in late 1992 at London's Dominion Theater, is the last chronologically, recorded mere months before he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, which ultimately killed him at the age of 32.At the time he was tragically struck down, Hicks was at his creative peak. A thinking comedian, more Voltaire than Carrot Top, his act challenged his audience's beliefs about politics, religion, sex and popular culture. Add to that a decade spent working hostile audiences in bad comedy clubs, which polished his stand-up comedy skills and made him extremely comfortable in front of any sort of crowd imaginable.After a decade spent in obscurity in his native USA, he had become a popular and respected performer in the UK, which he toured regularly after 1991. The British crowds welcomed Hicks' topical humor, and it is in this context that he recorded Revelations in November 1992.Hicks' material, although heavily based on current events of the early 90's, has aged gracefully. Revelations was filmed only days after Bill Clinton's election and Hicks is obviously thrilled to see the end of twelve years of fundamentalist conservatism. He also goes back to the first Gulf War (the source of some of his greatest material), the LA Riots and the JFK assassination. He also attacks what he sees as case examples of the lousy state of American culture, such as American Gladiators or Basic Instinct, and the marketing machine behind them.Despite often leaning towards misanthropy, Bill Hicks' message remained optimistic and positive. His parting words ('It's Just A Ride') remains one of his best and most oft-quoted allegories, describing as a poet would his view of the meaning of life.Altogether, Revelations is Bill Hicks at the peak of his powers as a comic/poet/philosopher/goatboy. It is the most compelling proof on film as to why, twelve years after his untimely death, his star is still rising."
tt0152183,"This is the ultimate Bill Hicks stage experience. Due to his early departure, his output was relatively small, but the best moments of his later carrier were here. If you're looking for a more comprehensive overview, American: The Bill Hicks Story (2009) would be the best source.I've discovered Revelations during the second Iraq war. What made it even funnier was that all remarks about Bush Sr. could have been transferred to then current president - Bush Jr. There were other, more universal jokes, which were a constant part of Bill's material: Kennedy assassination, quitting smoking and religion.There have been a few people who pushed stand-up comedy this far beyond making people laugh and Bill Hicks was arguably the best among them. His gigs were social and political commentary which, in turn, has closed some doors during his carrier. In Revelations we saw him in a great shape and in front of an audience which he guided masterfully.Unfortunately, what seemed to be a breaking point of Bill's career happened shortly before he passed away."
tt0400234,"Anurag Kashyap is one of the best directors working in the Hindi film industry. I loved films like Ugly and Raman Raghav 2.0 and hearing this was one of his best, I had to check it out.Black Friday tells the story of the 1993 bomb blasts through the perspectives of the police, the perpetrators and everyone else involved.I find it fascinating how this film got pushed back so much and after seeing it, I can understand why. Based on the detailed book by Hussain Zaidi, Black Friday goes through everything leading up to the event and the aftermath and does it in a brutally honest manner. This film is risky and it's risky because it uses all the names of the people involved. Kashyap tried to make this a truly honest depiction of what was going on and that's what makes it really hardhitting. Without sugarcoating anything, Black Friday remains an interesting watch as we see the ins and outs of the bomb blasts. The film has many characters and trying to juggle everyone's story isn't an easy task but Kashyap does his best here and gives each important character ample screen time.Considering the film's budget limitations, this film still manages to capture the horrific nature of the blasts. Once it happens, seeing how it disturbs everyone's lives and the amount of dead bodies shown covered in blood is very intense and handled very realistically. I loved the use of red during the interrogation scenes as it increased the intense nature of the scene. The film isn't flawless. There are a couple of audio and editing issues. I think the 2 hour 40 minute runtime is a bit too long and occasionally loses steam during some parts but Black Friday is riveting most of the time.What really excels in this movie are the performances and I think everyone was terrific. Kay Kay Menon did a great job. I really felt the seriousness of his character during those interrogation scenes. Aditya Srivastav also did a fantastic job as one of the terrorists. The standout though was Pavan Malhotra as Tiger Memon. He owned every scene he was in. It was also really surprising to see a lot of well known people who were unknown at the time like Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Gajraj Rao and Imtiaz Ali.Black Friday is a fantastic study on the 1993 bomb blasts and it's very impressive considering the low budget they had to work with. I would recommend giving it a watch."
tt0400234,"I would say Anurag in the making. One amazing movie given those times of 2000s. The facts put in the simplest way. No drama no fabled stories and ingredients, simple plain truth, as was needed for such a complex and sophisticated but unfortunate event of our country."
tt0400234,"Films based on books are a rarity in India. Probably that accounts for the huge amount of movies without any coherent screenplay that India churns out. Black Friday, on the other hand, is an exception, which will make any film maker proud.The movie, revolving around the investigation following the horrifying Bombay bomb blasts, and also showing the perpetrators' lives just before and after the incident, took a long time to get through the Censor Board, and it's not difficult to imagine why once you have seen the movie. The movie tries to portray everything the way it actually happened, or at least as the book says it happened, and succeeds. Technically the movie is top league, compared to other Hindi movies, though the editing is choppy in places. The music, by Indian Ocean, is brilliant, and more importantly suits the plot. Despite the length of the movie the director never loses grip, and that's really commendable.I haven't seen Satya (and I am sorry for that), so I am not very familiar with Anurag Kashyap's work (though he also did the dialogues, I believe, for Yuva, which I have seen), but considering the smoke he generates with every movie, I knew there had to be some fire to it too. And Black Friday IS fiery! The movie doesn't ever try to be politically correct and the director is almost obsessed with showing everything - even the correct language - which shall make it unsuitable for family viewing.The actors, with Kay Kay (he should be getting awards for this one) and Aditya Srivastava worth special mention, do a very good job too, and I think many of them are of a theatre background, which ensures a high pedigree in Indian movies. Those familiar with Indian TV serials must have seen Srivastava in an eminently well-made series called 9 Malabar Hill from the late 90s, which also starred Pawan Malhotra. Srivastava has been seen in many other smaller roles in movies and TV serials since then, but that particular role had showed how good an actor he is, and it is proved here once more. Pawan Malhotra is also a known face in India's parallel cinema movement, though he is prone to overact at times. Kay Kay is one of the best actors to have hit the Indian screen in recent years, and brilliant performances aren't new to him.The movie is unique in the sense that it shows the life of a terrorist AFTER the blast and how he copes with all the pressures. Then there's the pressure faced by the investigators to get to the terrorist, but taking care at the same time that they don't harm innocent people in their zeal. When I saw in the credits that the movie was based on a book by a Muslim author, I started feeling that it was going to be a biased description of the atrocities of Mumbai police on innocent members of the Musilm community during the investigations. Such a thought process is shameful, but natural in India's circumstances. But surprisingly, and thankfully, the movie, and so I suppose the book too, is as objective as it could have been without appearing sympathetic to either of the parties.To finish off, this is one of those (very rare) movies that convince you that the future isn't all that bad for Hindi cinema. A must watch for all Hindi movie fans, and even those who normally don't watch Hindi movies because of the unrealistic gloss and song-and-dance routines."
tt0400234,"This is not only a film. It's a lesson. It's a message. It's cruelly true history. It's an initiative. It's an attempt. It's a bold step, forward. It's known yet untold bare truth. And after all it's a film.No doubt the film opens old wounds, but only to find the root cause of it, only to find cure for them, only to make sure they are eradicated and never surface again. The film presents the hard facts about the 1993 serial bomb blasts in Mumbai (then Bombay). The film gives a new dimension to real life cinema, with real name, real incidents, and real people. The usage of actual news footage of the incidents make you believe whatever you are watching. It takes courage to take names of some of the biggest name in underworld and Indian politics as bluntly, and the filmmaker shows that courage. The story doesn't point finger on any particular person, group or community as the culprit for what is still Indian crime history's biggest tragedy. It tries to make a point how some clever minds make their business out of our religious sentiments, at the cost of lives of common men. Men who are common in every sense of it. The terror, the attacks, the explosions, the riots inhales not any particular community but the whole humanity.Director churns out a stunning effort. Technically too the film is impeccable. The blast sequences couldn't have got any more realistic. Each actor performs his character to full honesty, but Badshah Khan and Tiger Memon stand out.And before you jump to your own conclusion to decide the culprit(s), to decide the fate of them, the film concludes with the quote that says it all.An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.A must watch."
tt0400234,"I remember watching the trailers of Black Friday a couple of years ago and making it a point to watch it.Never before has anyone dared to approach such a controversial issue so blatantly,which is probably why it worked.The events that are depicted in this movie shook not only the city of Bombay but the nation as a whole.To add to the documentary-like look at the blasts of '93,director Anurag Kashyap has done a brilliant job of elucidating moving,intense performances from fine actors like Kay Kay Menon and Aditya Srivastava. Technically, Black Friday is more visionary than most Hindi movies ever made.It did not have exotic locations,an ensemble star cast of the most high profile actors in the industry,or an unlimited budget,all of which are necessities for an Indian movie.The use of complex Steadicam shots,slow motion and hand-held cameras really put the movie into a different perspective.The use of lighting in situations such as the interrogations being bathed in red light also helped set the mood required to really go into the depths of all the stories of the main characters which have been intricately woven together with finesse. Hats off to Mr. Anurag Kashyap for bringing such a fine piece of art to Indian cinema.Seems like the time spent with Mr. Mani Ratnam,the greatest Indian director ever to get behind a camera,is paying off.This is evident in the tinge of patriotism and realism portrayed.Personally i hope guys with vision like this continue bringing quality to Indian cinema.It really needs it."
tt0400234,"'Black Friday' is horrifyingly raw. It's overwhelmingly dark. It's frighteningly real. It's daringly gritty and graphic. Anurag Kashyap's film is one of the most skillfully executed movies of recent times. A great screenplay, strong light effects, the use of color, the direction, the performances, the background score work together very effectively. The cinematography, whether the shaky camera, the zooming or the closeup shots, works brilliantly. 'Black Friday' is slick (but not so much as to take away from the realness). Actors Kay Kay Menon, Aditya Shrivastava and Pavan Malhotra do an excellent job in the acting department.Based on Hussain Zaidi's book of the same title, 'Black Friday' revolves around the investigation of the infamous Bombay blasts (after which Bombay became Mumbai) in the early 90s. The movie opens with a 'boom' and from then on the intricate investigation proceeds. As the trial was still in process, Kashyap had to wait years before his movie could finally release in 2007. The director deserves credit for bravely making a film on such a serious and risky subject.However, it does have the documentary feel. Kashyap breaks the film into chapters and this gave the feeling that one was watching a documentary series. The pace isn't steady because the film does drag at certain points.'Black Friday' is a brave well-made film and it is one that should be watched. Not everyone might like it but on some level they may appreciate it."
tt0400234,"this is movie is fantastic. two things; i seen this movies in Bombay( Mumbai) where it had no subtitles. i didn't understand a single word that was being said but i totally understood almost every scene in the film ,(except those that all new characters in them). luckily i had just read Maximum City, Bombay Lost and Found By sekula Metha, which details a lot of the events in the movie. i am from Ireland and i don't speak any of the languages in th film. Marastaha? Hindi? As an exercise in visual film Making it was excellent. i cant wait to watch this again with subtitlesThe acting was superb. deserves to be seen in the west"
tt0400234,"It saddens me that posters on this thread have the need to brand this as a 'bollywood' movie. the brilliance that is ' black Friday' is so far,far,far removed and so many million times better than any of the dross that conventional ' bollywood' could ever even HOPE to produce makes 'bollywood' a throughly inappropriate branding for ' black Friday'.for me, 'black Friday' is paving the way for what Indian cinema *should* be doing more of....that is, challenging it's audience and offering some intellectual stimulation.I realise that the Indian cinema public's demand is overwhelmingly for ' boy meets girl, boys long lost brother/best friend also loves the same girl, they have a fight, then they realise they are brothers and engage in a 30 minute dance recital', type of bullshit, but Indians are becoming more sophisticated and I for one cannot wait for the more serious and discerning productions to come from India that truly challenges the mind and senses.'Black Friday' in this regards represents a HUGE turning point for Indian cinema.don't miss it..it's a must see movie on so many levels."
tt0400234,"Kashyap's early work stands out as one of his finest achievements, thanks to the extensive research and dedication that went into its culmination.It's worth noting that Anurag Kashyap was not a widely known name at the time and was still relatively new to the world of cinema and the industry of Bollywood for that matter. Regardless, he managed to successfully deliver a gritty and authentic feature, despite limited resources and permits.However, it should be mentioned that the film may feel slightly outdated & unpolished due to its documentary-style structure, as opposed to a more conventional narrative format."
tt0400234,"Mr. Anurag Kashyap,Take a bow! Black Friday is sincerely the greatest piece of cinematic magic to be released ever. You and your team have produced cinema of the highest quality, raised the notch by a few miles and used this medium like never before, hats off to you sir!I must admit that I am slightly biased toward your film because I have been born and brought up in Bombay and on March 12, 1993 (the day of the serial blasts) was just 8 years old. As Salman Rushdie famously calls children born during the era of Indian Independence as ""Midnight Children"", i would like to say we are but ""Blast Children"". Children whose innocence has been shattered mercilessly by the underworld and extremists from every religion and you have portrayed just that in your film. The film does not hype terrorism or romanticize the darkness of Bombay or the coldness of its police like many other so called underworld films do but portrays exactly what happens in reality, the human side. Sir, your film has merged the very shady line between cinematic magic, fiction and reality to an intoxicating mix of actuality.Pawan Malhotra (Tiger Memon), Kay Kay (Rakesh Maria) and Aditya Srivastava (Badhshah Khan) do not act, they live and breathe the very sentiments of these real life people. As a viewing audience I never once felt like I was watching a film, but felt like a 'fly on the wall' as the plot unfolds before your very eyes, the very same helplessness as Mumbaikars felt on that very day of the bomb blasts. The music by Indian Ocean is outstanding, it flows as easily as your reel does and blends so very brilliantly with the script. The cold chill that trickles down your spine as Dawood Ibrahim is shown in his mansion in Dubai is breathtaking. The authenticity of Bombay and its various locations from fast food restaurants in Bandra to the passport office in Worli is worth many many accolades. Mr. Kashyap, this film has struck the very chord of life in cinema once more. I'm sure everybody who watches it will share similar sentiments as I do. I am glad that the 2 year dustbin wait for your film did not deter you from eventually getting it released. You are not alone sir, the world supports your work with open arms. The silver screen is worth visiting again. Thank you sir and take a bow again..Yours sincerely, Aditya"
tt0400234,One of the earliest work from Kashyap which literally brings him into the game of mainstream cinema. Black Friday is based on 1993 Bombay (Now Mumbai) bomb blasts and its investigation. Despite of being completed and presented in Locarno International Film Festival in 2004 the theatrical release was halted due to the petition filed in court by the time film got approval for its release it was too late yet it was released in 2007 due to which film lost hi charm in its technical area however film got praises from both critiques and masses. Actual footages can also be seen in movie to set the premise and facts straight. Film roughly shows how Politics and Religious beliefs creates anarchy when sentiments are being manipulated and how third party uses it for their benefits. Religious riots scenes were chilling and showed how it becomes a justification to hurt the opposite sects I guess that is why film concluded with Gandhi's quote 'An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind'. Blended with some good performances this movie is for dark cinema lovers
tt0400234,Should include truth from Hindu side also. This movie does not show all truth. This false truth. First karsevack was killed by Muslim. Babri masgid was bullied on ram mandir . No one mentioned about that. First you should inform about Quran and JIHAD. Then we can talk about Hindu aggression.
tt0400234,"Mind blowing. Astounding. Astonishing. Superb. Enthralled. I could go on and put in all adjectives from the dictionary and even then I would still feel I need to say more. 1000 words isn't enough to write a review on Black Friday. Anurag Kashyap's foray into Bollywood was marred by the judiciary for more than 2 years, but finally the wait ended a few days back. And we were given the privilege to see the true potential of Indian film making. The topic was sensitive. Highly sensitive, one of the most tragic events in the last 3 decades in Indian history, an event which made Don Dawood Ibrahim as the #1 wanted man in India.Right from the beginning, the interrogation sequence where the prisoner confesses,""Sir, bombs are about to explode in the city sir"" Right from that word till the last scene where Tiger Memon says,""Mumbai mein dhamaka macha dega hum."" you are glued to your seat, wondering what will the director make you see next ? The casting for the movie was in my opinion perfect. One may criticize that Kay Kay Memon was underused, but in my opinion, he was just perfect. He wasn't given much screen appearance but whatever time he had, he brought everyone to their feet. His dialogs brought the entire theater applauding. Aditya Srivastava and Pawan Malhotra were equally good, if not better. Pawan Malhotra's portrayal of the underworld don Tiger Memon was just superb. Same goes for Aditya Srivastava's portrayal of Badshah Khan, the terrorist who turned as a police witness. His struggle to escape the country, from the clutches of Mumbai police was just marvelously portrayed. A person helplessly running around the country, lack of money, being chased around by an unknown force. And when mentioning the casting one cannot but ignore Vijay Maurya as the feared Dawood Ibrahim. He was given about a couple of minutes at maximum of screen presence but even in that minute period he brought a shiver up your spines.Black Friday is also a very good technical movie. The special effects used are pretty advanced and are at par with Hollywood. The script although adapted is superb. Every expression, dialog will make you feel for the characters in the movie.Just remember this isn't a movie about Hindus or Muslims. At first you feel for all the people getting killed by the blasts, but later when the riots are shown, then you feel for the Muslims as well. But this ain't a movie for any of the religious sentiments. Its about the society as a whole in those few years in Mumbai. This is the type of movie that India should send to Oscars and other film festivals/awards. The world should be made known that we can make movies that will claim fame and bring India to the global picture.10/10 !!!"
tt0400234,"I just watched Black Friday last night at home and didn't feel like missing a single scene or even a shot of the movie. I was totally concentrated and lost in this movie. I felt how a genuine, appreciable and real effort can go wasted on box office. Such movies should run well even on box office as well as in award functions.Kay Kay Menon is one of my favorite actor as well as Pavan Malhotra in his intense role playing. Hats off again to this movie from 1st scene to last one. The sequence of Badshah Khan moving Rampur to Jaipur to Kolkata and back to Rampur is truly worth-watching. I know this movie didn't mean to earn profits or a MASALA FLICK that's why it became a serious cinema and worth watching.Anurag Kashyap has really done a brilliant and hard-hitting job. I wanted to see this movie from the moment I came to knowledge about it. I really enjoyed every moment though I found there were many censor cuts during the movie and BEEP tones during bad words speaking. Anurag made it hardcore real.I am not here to reveal or tell the story as it will spoil concentration and excitement of the watchers who didn't watch this movie yet. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND BY BEING A REAL MOVIE-WATCHER TO SEE THIS MOVIE ANY WAY YOU CAN GET IT.I learned that because of politicians' dirty plays, games and just because of their selfishness such incidences happens frequently in our country and which interrupts India to move further progressively. Such degressing tact, cheats and bad intentions of our politicians ruins peace between 2 religions and whatever they do they do just for their own benefit. How many innocent people were killed during such riots and blasts that's nightmarish thought and DID THIS POLITICIANS EVER THINK ABOUT THEIR INNOCENT FAMILIES WHILE PLANNING SUCH THINGS? My anger is purely towards THE POLITICIANS not to any Hindu or Muslim. Now our young generation must come up with their new ideas, intelligence and unity to fail such bad and dishonest intentions of Indian POLITICIANS.BLACK Friday is most worth watching that's all."
tt0400234,Just watch it and decide for your self.This film presents the naked truth of Hindu -Muslim riot
tt0400234,"Anurag Kashyap is no doubt a talented man. Black Friday is a brave and commendable effort to show some of the details behind the infamous 1993 Bombay blasts. The movie is based on a detailed account by Hussain Zaidi in a book of the same name. The movie progresses in a series of chapters that zig zag in time and show us the blasts, the chance finding of an unexploded van, tracing it to Tiger Memon and the subsequent capture of his manager. At this point the case busts open and a slew of arrests are made and the conspiracy uncovered. Fingers are pointed to ISI as being ultimately culpable in the crime as they fund Tiger Memon's scheme, which seems to have been concocted in a fit of rage, and purely for personal revenge as opposed to any communal feelings.The good: For the most part the movie has a very real and gritty feel to it . The cast is chosen for their ordinariness in looks and great acting ability and is led by the very able Kay Kay Menon. Here he is the police officer Maria - has vowed to solve the case but is also shown as the anguished man, torn at what has to be done to break each and every arrested man by any means necessary. Pavan Malhotra very believably plays the rabid eyed Tiger, and Aditya Srivastava is very real as the hunted man Badshah on the run from pillar to post. Documentary footage is well used in the film and the run from Delhi to Rampur to Jaipur to Calcutta to Delhi to Rampur very realistic. One can almost smell the dust in the locales. The music is haunting and sparingly used. Arre Ruk Ja Re Bande is beautiful.The bad: The movie is shot is an extremely repetitive manner and reminded me somewhat of the Betaal stories from Chandamama - they too always ended with the Betaal taking the corpse and hiding in a tree. Here a different body is being chased in every chapter and then caught. Why have different chapters if they will all show the same thing with different people? The story zig zags back and forth in time and Anurag does not trust us to be able to keep it straight - so he obliges by color coding the past and present as blue and regular. The torture scenes are strangely coded a blood red! The blasts left a trail of devastation and we are shown the obligatory child eating out of a garbage can, blown up bodies, blood splattered torsos. Such INDIVIDUAL pictures of the aftermath of terror take away from the big impact of the terror and are only useful when they show someone we already care about. Mani showed us the gasoline soaked twins in Bombay and sent a chill down our spine - these could be our children. Anurag's bodies are remote by virtue of being so close. In fact this remoteness is a flaw in the film, it smacks of a docudrama where the only character you can even remotely identify with is the police officer. There can be little or no audience involvement in such a film.Nevertheless, this is a brave attempt and one will expect better and better from Mr. Kashyap in the future."
tt0400234,"I would give this film a 10 out of 10, but I don't think any film can be perfect. Anurag, you are a genius! This film is great. Not only is it a true story, but it has been shot in a very unique fashion...The flashbacks, etc make this film so unique. Also the red shots and the blue shots also give a feel of reality. The acting, cinematography, editing, and action was all top notch and made the film very realistic. This is not your everyday masala, popcorn flick but a very well made, thought provoking film. It's really sad that the Indian government can't handle reality. This film shouldn't have been banned. The public should know what happened in 1993. This was a very good movie but only for those who enjoy realistic films. This along with a few other bollywood films (Omkara, dor, rang de basanthi), goes against the stereotype that all bollywood films have a set formula of a boy meeting a girl and dancing and singing. It's sad and pathetic how films like these don't get popular internationally. Many foreigners think of Bollywood as escapist cinema with cheesy dance numbers. More films like black Friday need to release (And become popular) in order to destroy this generalization among foreigners."
tt0400234,"Daud Ibrahim was unaware of what he was smuggling(rdx) from ISI to India.
This shows the mindset of Bollywood directors."
tt0400234,"Black Friday Is a movie to be watched by every Indian no matter if he don't like violence movie , its a real cinema & truth we should accept because many knows only one side of a blast story, after watching movie i saw both the side which i was not aware of , accused person who were involved in blast should be given severe imprisonment , but what about other who were indirectly involved it by landing RDX ,this was not possible without their help,actors in movie are real artist ,casting was excellent location are real , blast scene were terrific , hats off to director of the movie it needs guts to make such type of cinema , worth watching this movie,"
tt1524539,"This movie was the official entry for the Oscars 2010 in the best foreign language film category from India. Though the movie is in Marathi,it actually transcends that minor barrier. It is a winner all the way , well written and directed by Paresh Mokashi.Even though Indian film industry is dominated by Bollywood (Personally I hate that word) such movies like Harishchandrachi Factory are entertaining as well as intelligent. Thanks to the multiplexes such movies no longer have a restricted regional release.Throughout the movie there is a feel good element and one does not feel like being taken for a fool.It depicts the journey of the pioneer Dada Saheb Phalke as he faces hardships while making his magnum opus and how he overcomes them. Without giving away much, I will say watch out for the way the director has recreated that era.The performances by the actors are refreshing and believable.Never give up on your dreams, work wholeheartedly and you will win.This message is underlined throughout with out playing up to the galleries.I gave it 9/10."
tt1524539,"I love movies about the movies, and this one is a standout.Often I've thought about the dawn of cinema - that first heady round, the rush of making a picture that moved. Here's an appropriately joyful - and funny! - glimpse of that moment in India, home of the world's biggest movie business, the story of the making of India's first full-length film. It starts when the man known as Dadasaheb Phalke sees a film for the first time -- British, short, Jesus dying and rising from dead, in a no-frills sort of way -- and gets the idea of making a movie like this for Indians, about Indian culture. It ends with the completion and recognition of the full-length Rajah Harishchandra, an historical film of a virtuous long-ago king. (The present film's title means ""Harishchandra's Factory"": in India in about 1913, if you've got a job on a film, what do you tell your neighbors who've never seen one? Phalke's advice -- say you work at a ""factory"" -- the foreign word will impress them and keep them out of your hair.)The character of Phalke, as played with warmth and charm by Nandu Madhav, would be optimistic ""to a fault,"" except that his persistence is so right, even when he goes to London alone and unannounced to get the advice and equipment he needs. He is in some ways the preoccupied technician/professor type, and in a pitch-perfect decision, director/writer Paresh Mokashi gives us a larger world that meets his somewhat blinkered but brilliant obsession with more or less unfailing appreciation and support. Local appreciation may be slower in coming, but of course we know that it did.The story, all very solidly researched, is carried more by our itch to see his film get made and shown than by any manufactured tension about too many bad things happening. And by our anticipation of the next comic moment - expect special delight once casting problems arise where no woman will go near the camera, and mustache-retention problems arise when compromise casting for ladies' roles is accomplished.The husband-wife partnership shines, Vishawai Deshpande's lovely and grounded Mrs P learns to develop film, and whatever is in her heart lets her survive furniture sales and big risks without resorting to nagging. Especially elegant, the matter-of-fact cooperation between Phalke and British film guys, who ""get"" him more or less right away, the way artists worldwide have pretty much always loved each other and their work in fellowship, irrespective of national tensions and problems.Finally - production values are high, this looks as beautiful as it should and - for any worried western viewer - this is not a musical!! it's a ""regular movie."""
tt1524539,"Hi everyone,as i have mentioned i love watching movies more than i love programming...so i have decided to write a kind of review of movies which i see....after 3-4 days finally today i got time to watch ""Harishchandrachi Factory""... when i started it i was hoping to see a very serious kind of movie which will depict life ""Dadasaheb Phalke-- Father of Indian Cinema""..but it turned out to be a very pleasant, gentle movie....well the movie starts with a maverick man who has left his good printing business and is working as magician doing street shows....he happens to see a ""motion picture""..well normally you wont give a damn about this word...but this movie will surely tell u what it really represents......after watching this cinema..he decides to do his own motion picture or ""a drama on screen"" as people first used to call motion pictures....movie then goes through his efforts to make his dream real...the best thing about movie is not actually the story but the way it is presented on the screen.... there are few scenes which are truly remarkable ..specially where Phalke sells his cupboard to buy books and people started making a big deal out of it..as if someone has died... part where phalke is looking for women actors to portray Taramati and mustache saga....Nandu Madhav has played character extremely well but one thing i couldn't stop noticing about his acting was..it kind of looked like Chalie Chaplin...i dnt know if its true...but u have to c it yourself.... another beautiful aspect of movie was how relation between phalke and his wife is handled...its shear pleasure watching the couple together....Vibhavari Deshpande who enacted Saraswati Phalke has done well job too....Director Paresh Mokashi has done beautiful job in writing as well as directing... portraying a life a man in 97 min is really a tough job.... so in all a nice movie... and a nice tribute to the originator of Indian Cinema which currenlty is biggest film industry in the world...."
tt1524539,"""Harishchandrachi Factory"" is Indian Cinema's official entry into the Academy Awards and the million-dollar question is - does it justify? Yep, you bet! Maybe not soul-stirring, not a tear-jerker either, sans social message and not even magnum-opus.... yet ""Harishchandrachi Factory"" lingers in your head like a sweet aroma. Biopics generally tend to have a format which demonstrate the hardships and struggle of an individuals to realise the dream. It is exactly here ""Harishchandrachi Factory"" truly standouts by adopting an untrodden path. It depicts Mr. Phalke's journey of creating the first celluloid on Indian Cinema without getting over-bearing, in the light-hearted way possible ensuring the essence is not lost. I am sure the truth is far from it and should not discount the pains Mr. Phalke underwent to plant the seeds of germination for Indian Cinema. Performances are spot-on, especially Nandhu Madhav who portrays Mr. Phalke. Nicely complimenting him is Vibhwari Deshpande as Mrs. Phalke to extent the audience would feel that marriages are indeed made in heaven. If Mr. Phalke is depicted as an eccentric genius, his better-half is no less crazy. There are a few emotional moments in the movie like for instance when Phalke loses his eye-sight or when his son falls ill but what is commendable is that either its depicted humorously or the narrative moves on to the next part. The screenplay and editing should be complimented. Of course, the writer/ director truly deserves standing ovation for choosing Dadasaheb Phalke as his subject. And last but not the least UTV for backing this deserving project. Let me not comment on the chances of ""Harishchandrachi Factory"" garnering statuettes at Academy awards, however I am confident that you will google and read about Dadasaheb Phalke after watching this movie."
tt1524539,"I watched 3 movies last weekend: Up in the Air, Invictus and Harishchandrachi Factory, in that order. And Harishchandrachi Factory really touched my heart. If you ask a South African, he might say Invictus. But I, for one, love Marathi movies for their humor.HF (I cannot type Harischandrachi Factory all the time) is about how Dadasaheb Phalke, i think he is called Father of Indian cinema, made the first movie in India, ""Raja Harishchandra"". He must've gone through a lot while making the movie. But the portrayal of the events is damn funny. My roommate, who does not understand Marathi was literally on the floor laughing! Excellent acting, direction, attention to detail and did I mention funny? And it does teach you to follow your heart and don't care about results. Loved the way his family supports him.Must watch for all movie fans and non movie fans too!"
tt1524539,"I was one of the lucky persons to catch this movie in sept 09, well in advance of its release, in International Film Festval Nagpur, and even more delighted when it was selected for the Academy awards. Once again Marathi cinema has one more feather on its cap for this extraordinary piece of art. Its more of a tribute to Late Dadasaheb Phalke and a token of appreciation for initiating a movement that went on to create the second largest movie industry in the world. The movie begins with a simple scenario of a unemployed man who gets inspired from a British motion picture theater( in a tent). The movie showcases very truly how people used to look up to cinema in earlier days, paying ticket to watch blurry b&w moving images without audio. Not only it was difficult to think of making something like a motion picture but rather impossible as there were no sources to explore the possibility of such a thing. The approach of Dadasaheb Phalke towards making a motion picture and that too beginning from less than a scratch has been beautifully shown to the finest detail. What the catchy part of the movie is that you are taken into a pleasant trance mood right from the initial scene, maybe because of the humor tinge given to the film in almost every scene. Every scene, even the emotional ones does have a funny element of character attached to it to keep you laughing all the way. It must be the first drama film to have a tinge of humor attached to go for Oscars. Or maybe its selected at the first place as the film is based on the life of Father of Indian Cinema. But it doesn't take away any credit by the makers of this film for creating a masterpiece. Hope its in the top five at the academy awards and hope it wins it too."
tt1524539,"Arishchandrachi Factory depicts the making of India's first full-length feature film by Dadasaheb Phalke. First of all, this film was a magnificent watch for me. The film showed so many things but in a very entertaining way and this is the major plus point of this film. The editing of this reminded me of old silent films like Chalie Chaplin. BGM is so beautiful.Paresh Mokashi in his directorial debut did a wonderful job. Nandu Madhav as Phalke was just great & Vibhavari Deshpande as his supporting wife was perfect. If you're a true movie lover I'm sure there'll both tear & clap in the end. This was sent to the Oscars and in my opinion it should've won. This is a Must Watch for those love cinema or want to become filmmaker in future.Available on Netflix.© MandalBros."
tt1524539,"'Harischandrachi Factory' (HF) is my second Marathi movie (the first one being 'Shwaas' – another beautiful feature). I must say Marathi cinema makes some very refreshing and sensitively relevant movies. By sensitive I do not mean overly sentimental or high on drama – no. We get enough of that from Bollywood, thank you! I mean in the sense that there are certain humane subtleties that very few film makers can successfully capture on celluloid. Those infinite number of imperfections that are almost impossible to record in the confines of raging mediocrity that are only possible when features like HF come by. For this, I am eternally grateful to Mr. Paresh Mokashi – the director of HF, his debut feature.Now, about HF. The story tracks the trials and tribulations of Dadasaheb Phalke as he prepared to make the first Indian movie in 1913 – 'Raja Harischandra'. What makes this movie unique is how humor is consistently used to portray a journey which I am certain was, in reality, strewn with a million challenges. Everything from prostitutes refusing to be on camera, to men reluctant to shave their mustaches since their fathers were still alive, brings a unique essence of authenticity to the times we lived in. There are men (dressed as women) working for Phalke who are unsure what to tell people about their dubious sounding profession of making 'moving photographs'. We even have mentions of how Phalke's previously owned photography business went bankrupt when rumors spread that the camera 'steals a person's soul' and was a machine made to perform black magic. As hilarious as all this might seem today, there is no denying that Dadasaheb must have undergone so much more in this Herculean dream of achieving the impossible specially at a time when theater and drama were the only forms of entertainment.What makes HF a must see movie is not just the fact that it underlines India's first major milestone in the business of movie making, but also the subtle and lighthearted approach it takes to such an immensely important event in our history. A feat, I am sure, would have suffered with a 'Schindler's List'-like formula of movie making had it been given to film makers who do not believe that a serious story can be told in a joyful tone. For this singular achievement, I salute Mr. Mokashi.Performances belong to everyone. Even though I did not know any of the actors, their conviction in what they were trying to convey went beyond the need for a familiar face. The film maker's vision is crystal clear, as he focuses entirely on those pivotal years when Phalke, realizing his purpose in life, embarks on such a risky, albeit exciting, venture with full fledged support from his wife Saraswati Bai and two young sons. It is in this essential vein of eternal optimism, that HF scores high points in my book. In a day and age where we see movie success constantly attached to vulgar language, deliberate sexual innuendos and violence of the extreme nature, HF exemplifies the word 'quality' just by following one mantra – keep it simple.My verdict : Do yourself a favor and go watch HF. If not for anything else, then at least to acknowledge the efforts of the father of Indian cinema – Dadasaheb (Dhundiraj) Govind Phalke. A legendary name now only synonymous with debatable award recipients like Amrita Rao for mediocre performances to justify their achievement. Unfortunate."
tt1524539,"The film is about the first motion picture for the Indian movie industry. Being the biggest movie industry now with an annual release of over 1000 films, India has the profitable movie industry across the nation. The credit goes to Dr. Phalke who started it over 100 years before. The history of making the first movie is portrayed in this film.A good background on the country's struggle to freedom is also dealt (with reference to Tilakji). The best thing I loved about this film is the reflection on the long-lost culture of India (something like women not looking at other men and having their heads covered with their Saree when someone enters the house). Contrary, these days young women are half-naked even in churches. I found no negatives in this movie except there ain't any sad/tragic moments in any part of the movie. No wonder the movie was awarded. A good and must watch with the family on a weekend."
tt1524539,"A well intended story mashed up with fabricated emotions.Indeed, as film lovers we deserve to the story of the first film made in India ""Satya Harishchandra"" and also the story of the man behind making it ""Dadasaheb Phalke"". Yes, that is well presented and documented through this film. Yet, I believe many emotions were overblown or uncalled for in this film which is made into a melodrama intentionally. Though funny in parts, and entertaining too, the pain which Dadasaheb went through to make the first indigenous film was trivialized and that's the only qualm I have with respect to this film. Otherwise, it was a job well done.Directed by débutante, Paresh Mokashi he touches all the right chords in screenplay and script. Firstly, to make a film on this subject is in itself a brave attempt and I appreciate his courage. The writing was well intended and it tried to touch the nuances and the finer aspects of film making, be it correcting the film stock or manually editing the negative. Considering that this film was done a modest budget, I can appreciate the effort that was put in to bring the product the way it is.Acting is indeed fine by Nandu Madhav who plays the role of Dadasaheb Phalke. Indeed his kids do a fine job and are fun to watch more than anyone else. All others have done a commendable job too. But had they controlled their emotions in the last half an hour and did not dramatize it, I believe this would have been a greater film. The director should take the responsibility of that.The production values are OK considering the budget, but I wish such an important film that has history in it, could have been produced well and it deserved better sets and artifacts. The cinematography is just fine. There is no greatness and there is no flaw either. It does it's expected job and that's good. I was disappointed by the editing though, wish some moments were cut to mellow down the drama and stick to showing the real work done by Dadasaheb. Especially, in the last hour where he talks with Englishmen, about distribution of the film, there were some dialogs that were kept only to make Dadasaheb a great human being, which I thought were not so needed. He had done a great job by giving us the first film itself, now that needed to be reiterated is what I felt.I am going with 3/5 for a film that's historically important. I wish it could have been much more in terms of production values and editing."
tt1524539,"This Marathi film was India's official entry to Academy Awards (Oscars) in the Best Foreign Language film category for the year 2009. The movie is about the making of India's first feature film, Raja Harishchandra in 1913 by Dadasaheb Phalke. Phalke is a business man, who leaves his company and does magic shows to maintain his family. One day he and his son end up watching a film being shown in a local makeshift cinema, which makes Phalke curious. He then sets out to dream of making the first Indian movie and goes through many hardships to realize his dream. Right from the start the narration is crisp and garnished with light moments. I would say, these light comic moments and energetic portrayal of Dadasaheb Phalke by Nandu Madhav are the highlights of the film. Never once during the course of the film you feel like watching a biography. The other actors too have done their job quite well. The background music complements the script and narration effectively. A brilliant work by director Paresh Mokashi, this film is a 'very good watch'."
tt1524539,"Prakash Mokashi's 'Harishchandrachi Factory' is a breath of fresh air. Of late, when the Indian film industry has mostly been churning one stale product after another with minimal positive quality, Mokashi gives the viewer this Marathi gem. Now this isn't your traditional biopic that starts from birth and ends in death. Nor is it the depressive kind. 'Harishchandrachi Factory' is a movie that is both funny and poignant. It tells how India's first film director made the first Indian movie and this is done with heart and humour.The film starts off with Phalke skipping his job to work as a magician as he finds his passion in entertaining people. On impulse, he and his son decide to go to the theatre and they watch a short silent film about the 'Passion of Christ'. Phalke is moved by the experience and he keeps returning to the theatre. He decides to make a movie. The man just about makes enough to support his family, but his passion, determination and support of his family, especially his wife, allows him to pursue his destiny.Mokashi has chosen a unique way of storytelling that has barely been done with biopics. His humour is both satirical, situational, witty and even understated at times. At the same time he does not derail from the focus of the film and its characters. The characters are very real. Phalke may appear larger then life but at the same time he is the common man who lives his life with hope and a little sugar. His wife is far from the caricature wife who nags about her husband's risky attempts. She supports him all the way and does not hesitate to sell off their furniture to make her husband's dream come true. The comedic sequences work excellently. They had me laughing out loud.Nandu Madhav passionately plays who is today known as the father of Indian cinema. His spirited performance along with Vishawai Deshpande's natural portrayal as Mrs. Phalke are a delight to watch. The supporting cast do a commendable job too.'Harishchandrachi Factory' is a beautiful little film. The execution is first rate. The cinematography, score, editing and lighting are superb. Mokashi's charming gem is one of a kind and I am sure to revisit this just to feel this film-viewing experience once again."
tt1524539,"Last year marked the hundredth year of the Indian film industry. In these hundred years, Indian films, emerging from the Bollywood and is several sister (regional/local) ""woods"", have taken the masses as well as the classes on several memorable and entertaining journeys into the dreamworld. In his debut feature, writer-director, Paresh Mokashi traces the roots, nay, seeds of this thriving industry and presents the making of the very first Indian film.Harishchandrachi Factory is the story how Dhundiraj Govind Phalke, the pioneer regarded as the Father of Indian Cinema, happened to get this idea of making movies and how he toiled to realise this dream of making of the very first Indian full length, Black & White, silent, feature film - Raja Harishchandra.The story begins in 1911 where, after the failure of his printing business, Phalke is playing a magician/jester performing in his Mumbai chawl to make ends meet. When he happens to visit a tent theatre playing a movie - The Life of Christ, his imagination and curiosity are instantly kindled and he introduces his family to this magical experience of moving images, besides making multiple trips himself to understand the science behind that magic. His curiosity grows into an obstinate obsession as he follows his dream unflinchingly despite a brief bout of failing eyesight, he sets out to London to learn and understand this new age medium such that he could present the stories of the Indian mythology through it. On his return to India after learning the requisite skills and acquiring a motion picture camera, he embarks on his pioneering mission to make India's very first feature length silent movie - Raja Harishchandra. The rest of the movie narrates the eventful journey and the many hurdles that he faces on his ambitious mission.Presenting a biopic as a feature film is a challenging task as the director has to strike a fine balance in presenting the facts within a matrix of an engaging drama (as in the case of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's Bhaag Milkha Bhaag which found critical acclaim and commercial success). A singular focus on factual content would reduce the film to a drab documentary while too much focus on the drama could result in a clouded, less-than perfect image of the individual. Debutante writer-director Paresh Mokashi rises to this daunting challenge by helming this meta-movie with a very nimble hand and suffuses it with healthy doses of delectable humour. Mokashi shuns melodrama and mines humour in the most unlikely situations - be it Phalke's problems in funding his venture resulting in his selling domestic assets or his search for a heroine among prostitutes (since no family woman was ready to work before camera).He hits the bull's eye with his casting of his leads as well as the supporting cast. Nandhu Madhav nails the part of Phalke with oodles of charm, curiosity and a single-minded obsession to realise his dreams despite the multiple challenges of cynicism, superstitions and paucity of funds. Vibhavari Deshpande playing Saraswati Phalke shares a genial chemistry with him and is a perfect foil as the loving wife and pillar of strength enabling her husband to emerge as the pioneer.The movie also boasts of solid technical team which includes Nitin Desai whose art design recreates the authentic feel of a bygone era while the score from Anand Modak conjures a rustic charm that permeates the entire movie, beginning with the opening credits. The cinematography by Amalendu Chaudhary is remarkable too as he has striven to capture most of the movie in the style of stationary camera position which was prevalent in the infancy of cinema.Overall, Harishchandrachi Factory presents a very Indian story rich with its period feel, ethnic ethos, in a simple, feel-good narrative that is engaging and universally appealing. Harishchandrachi Factory was selected as India's official entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2009 and has also received several National and Regional awards."
tt1524539,"How can we call a movie as a brilliant work!It's simple as that making a movie with the limited resources s what a film maker is getting in his project!This movie is one of the major biographic movie about the history of Indian movie making and the discovering one of the major business in the country!The movie shows us how Mr.D.B.Phalke an ordinary Indian magician and a press business man turn into a phonier film maker and become the father of Indian cinema. This movie is made by Paresh Mokashi as his debuts feature film. Mokashi treated this movie to a simple comedy, and a family entertainer. This maid the movie an easy go! The screenplay, acting, editing, art, cinematography etc are been craved to its best. In reality the life of Phalke is such a big history and event, so making a movie about Phalke is such a big challenge to anyone who is will to do. But the brilliancy of Mokashi maid the life of Phalke to an awesome entertainer, this movie will be one of the treasure to Indian cinema for it's contend!To the viewers: - I want ever movie lover to watch this. It will inspire you too, to be a film maker."
tt1524539,This is a story that needed to be told. And what a fantastic job this movie has done.
tt1524539,"This is a must watch story of the guy who brought cinema to India.
It shows the dedication, passion, sacrifices this visionary made to make impossible possible."
tt1524539,It's a story of Shri Dada Saheb Phalke contribution into Indian film industry. Movie represents his journey in a very attractive way. It includes many funny scenes which make a must watch Marathi Indian movie.
tt1524539,"speech less !!!! can't imagine Marathi movie can be of this standard. Proud to see this movie. The story telling and screen play is so good that, doesn't feel like taking your eyes and mind of... Story show in so adverse situation , how a new thinking , a thinking that was considered as foolishness, has brought such a huge change in Indian cinema. The story is about the struggle of Dadasaheb Phalke to make a first feature film in India. The struggle that Dadasaheb Phalke faced and his determination to bring some thing new in India and create an industry and create jobs.Nandu Madhav as Dadasaheb Phalke did an excellent job, but i liked most his wife Saraswati Phalke (Vibhavari Deshpande), her role in Dadasaheb Phalke's life , she had given him unconditional support, because of which the dream of Dadasaheb Phalke was fulfilled. All the different actor in different characters have done an excellent job too. All credit goes to The Director, because i know how difficult is to make a movie like this. Thanks for such a movie , keep making such a beautiful movie."
tt1524539,"Wonderful acting, sets of perfect vintage flavour, maharastrian family culture, dialogues, music makes this one a must watch. Just see how this industry got its first novie through the Father of Indian cinema 'Dada saheb phalke'...Brilliant cinema!"
tt1524539,"If you are a cinema lover, this movie will straight away touch your heart. Filmmaking is not a profession but passion and the tone was set just right by the man himself, Dada Saheb Phalke. What's even better is that Paresh Mokashi has done an outstanding job whether it's the story, screenplay, direction, background score. Everything about this movie is just perfect. Casting is just right and every actor has done justice to the character.In spite of it being a biopic, director has done really well in highlighting the social issues and stigma prevalent at that time.For any aspiring filmmakers out there, this film is a lesson on how to become a filmmaker. A lesson which can't be taught in any institute around the world. Dadasaheb's passion to make a film without any support from anyone except his wife and his kids is the reason that we are blessed with Indian film industry and that is translated really well on screen.Without giving out the spoilers, I'd recommend this movie to everyone who loves cinema. This movie will make you fall in love with the art of filmmaking, all over again."
tt1524539,"This film is the right example of the perfect film... Beautifully crafted and acted. Funny, witty and unforgettable. An absolute joy to watch."
tt7286456,"The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way."
tt7286456,"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point."
tt7286456,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen."
tt7286456,"This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated."
tt7286456,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.
Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.
Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message.
It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too.
The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different.
It's BELIEVABLE.
There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people.
Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film."
tt7286456,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime"
tt7286456,"Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway."
tt7286456,"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director"
tt7286456,"Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing"
tt7286456,"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it."
tt7286456,"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh."
tt7286456,"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.
It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing."
tt7286456,"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.
To enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience."
tt7286456,"This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you."
tt7286456,"The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh."
tt7286456,"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways."
tt7286456,"Although Phoenix delivered an outstanding performance, the story is poor. Very long dialogues in the beginning, some action but finally the end is disappointing. This is not worth a 10."
tt7286456,"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.
I went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.
What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!"
tt7286456,"All hype and no substance. A pretty mediocre movie hyped up for no reason. Worth a watch if you have a few free hours to spare with nothing better to do or watch, but to rate this above 5 is just crazy."
tt7286456,I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.
tt4633694,"The worlds of superhero movies and superhero comics are not as similar as they seem on the surface. Currently, film studios are all about the ""extended universe"", seeing how many different titles and characters they can shove into one franchise (Avengers, X-Men, Justice League), making for an easy way to squeeze a few extra bucks out of their lesser known properties. Comics have this as well, of course. However, they also have something modern movies haven't really tapped into yet: story one-offs, a chance for a storyteller to create a unique tale and not be constrained by the implications on or from the larger universe. Spider-Verse gets to do just that, while playfully taking on the fun (if convoluted) absurdity of extended superhero universes.
Listen, I hear you. ""How could we possibly need another Spider-Man movie?"" Spider-Verse understands that question and has a take on it. Yes, Peter Parker is here. In fact, there are two Peter Parkers. There's also a Spider-Woman, a Noir Spider-Man, an anime Spider-Girl/Robot, and a Spider-Pig. At the center though is Miles Morales, an Afro-Hispanic Brooklyn teen who must help these other Spider-People get back to their own planes of existence. He fights with his cop dad, he adores his shady uncle, hates being simply the smartest kid in the room, and just wants to do something that matters. Being Spider-Man wasn't his idea, but hey, when a radioactive spider gives you powers, what choice do you have?
Look, I don't have any sort of hot take on this movie. It looks great, the humor pops with surprises, the voice casting is beyond perfect. It's simply a stylishly exciting and refreshingly unique take on the superhero genre, and sometimes that's more than enough."
tt4633694,"Amazing movie. Great animation, the best Spider-Man movie in my opinion"
tt4633694,"A movie worthy of Stan Lee's approval. Incredible animation, great story, great message. This film lives up to the hype and honestly surpassed my expectations. The only reason I think there are some negative reviews is because you can never please everyone. However, for the vast majority of viewers, I believe you'll find this film to be great. Highly recommend seeing it in theaters just for the amazing animation style."
tt4633694,"There's hardly anything I would improve about this film. The visuals, concepts, soundtrack, characters, pace, humor and animation are all some of the best I've ever seen in any film; I was worried the hype would ruin it for me, as it always does, but not even the group of kids in the theater who wouldn't stop loudly talking could ruin it for me. It is visually engaging and beautiful in every scene, not to mention with an incredibly unique art style, and is honestly something other animated movies should have to look up to for a long time. The only real issue I can think of is the flashing lights, which really alienates any epileptic audience, but even then it's done so in a beautiful and artful way."
tt4633694,"Updated review 4-9-19I've now watched this movie 10 times since getting it on digital and then Blu-ray and can safely say this is a rare, near perfect movie. This is of course my opinion and I understand why this movie isn't for everyone. Let's break down a few of the reasons why for each of these points.If we had a list of everything that can be done to make a near perfect movie, this movie checks every box. The visuals have been talked about endlessly. It won an Oscar for them. We know they're great.The story is great, giving us a new Spider-Man with his own skills and personality that he brings to the table. The script is tight and the production is executed with laser precision.The voice acting is nothing short of top notch. This is easily the second best thing about this movie right behind the glorious visuals.Shamiek Moore has quickly grown on me over the ten times I've watched this movie. His range is as good as any veteran actor and he injects so much life into Miles Morales. He IS Miles Morales.Chris Pine did not phone in the short amount of lines he had whatsoever. Just superb casting because he and Jake Johnson sound pretty similar. And oh boy, Jake Johnson.I never understood why JJ had gotten so wildly popular over the last several years. With this movie I finally understand. I get it. It clicked. From the moment he pops up in this movie around the 20 minute mark till the end, Jake turns in one of the voice acting performances perhaps of all time. He succeeds in bringing a past his prime Peter Parker to life and runs the gamut of dramatic, sincere, intense, but above all FUNNY. Every single comedic line never fails to make me laugh out loud. Many of the gags pop into my head while I'm working or doing something else and I'll chuckle and repeat the line to myself.I've always enjoyed Hailee Steinfeld and she shines in this movie along with all the supporting cast.The greatest thing about this movie also happens to be its weakness. For me, the visuals are second to none. Another review title summed it up perfectly. ""The most visually stunning movie I've ever seen"". Absolutely agree. And while it takes a little time - usually 10-15 minutes - for your eyes to adjust to the frame rate, some people apparently can not adjust to this. I can imagine how poor that viewing experience would be, too bad really. Another thing is since they didn't use actual motion blur, but instead chose to animate blur-like artifacts and tricks to make it seem like blur, or having images doubled and overlapped for a ghosting effect, it confuses some people into thinking they're seeing the 2 images of the 3D version without the glasses. And lastly, the sheer intensity of some of the rapid action sequences combined with visual aesthetic pushed just beyond the breaking point and then dialed ever so slightly back by the direction team, it's just simply too much for some people. I get that.As far as continuity/plot holes and things of that nature, I think the movie could actually stand to be about 15-20 minutes longer. There really aren't many issues though so maybe this is just me being greedy for more visuals.Original review: Sure, we can dissect and critique and praise using any number of words we choose, but in the end to actually appreciate truly great art, it simply must be experienced in the medium in which it was created. For this movie, it was lovingly crafted in 3D, and so in my opinion can only be fully realized by the viewer in 3D.What is a comic book movie, and what makes it great? From the original Superman where we first saw a comic book hero fly, to Burton's dark and stylized Batman, to the graphic novel style Sin City, live action ensemble X-MEN, Spider-Man, Iron-Man, The Dark Knight, the entire MCU....all of these are comic book movies, and depending on your personal definition probably range from good to great. And they're all live action with varying degrees of special effects, and some with animation. If you had to pick ones that 'feel the most like a comic book', you'd probably pick Sin City for the overall look, and the phase 3 MCU films for a combination of visuals and capturing the tone and spirit of the comic book story arcs.But they aren't literally animated comics. The closest to that would probably be the animated movies, right? Like Mask of the Phantasm or any number of the Marvel animated movies. But again those are really 'just cartoons', and I don't mean that in a bad way. They're simply cartoon versions of comic books.Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is quite literally an animated comic book, and yet it is so much more at the same time. It's an explosion of comic book ink and paper, a dizzying palette of superbly rich colors, a jaw dropping display of digital artistry melded with living, breathing characters we care about, a story that is perfectly derived from the very medium in which it is being created and yet not for one single moment ever feels forced or hollow, a soundtrack fused with an endless exploration of a massive city, staggeringly sized scientific chambers, gigantic forests, and neon-electric-digital-dreamscapes of action set pieces that whir and click and come to life exactly as they do in the minds of children reading them on paper.This movie is breathtakingly good in every aspect. Like-I'm-questioning-my-sanity-is-it-really-as-good-as-I-think-it-is!?!? Yes. Yes yes yes.Remember the old Sega game Comix Zone? And how it was like ""oh wow! It's a comic book come to life!""? This is like that, with modern technology, cranked up a thousand times.But here's the most important part - *it was all done in the right way, by the right people, at the right time*. It feels like this project was greenlit and handed to the very people who created comic books themselves with a ""here ya go, you have full creative control. Oh and by the way you have an unlimited budget! And resources! Have as much fun making a great movie as you possibly can!""My first job was working in a movie theater. I took full advantage of being able to see free movies. I've built a decent surround sound system with all the creature comforts and have a growing library of movies. From the re-release of the original Star Wars trilogy, to each of the prequels and to the ongoing trilogy today, T-2, Titanic, the original X-Men, Avatar, The Dark Knight, Avengers, Avengers: Infinity War and so many more...I've gone to many, many big movie theater events for the experience. And I can safely say hands down that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in 3D is the best moviegoing experience I have ever had. It's that great."
tt4633694,"Have you ever sat through a film and you knew that films would never be the same going forward? For example, Terminator 2, Star Wars.. the first Toy Story... Iron ManWell this is one of those. This is a almost rather perfect film. Let me just say the the stylished animation is just top notch. It as if the comic book leaped off the pages. I've seen practically all super hero films to include the DC animated ones. This feels as if they took comic books and Playstation animation and just came up with this perfect look.And the story is great.. the pacing is so wonderful. It is able to tell the story.. and an origin without boring us to tears like Zack Snyder has done in the DC universe. The story is quiet touching. And it allows us to have a pretty interesting Spider Man in Miles WITHOUT thrashing or having a Peter Parker like experience.Plus our the villains are so well done..But I think we will see a lot more of this type of animation in the future from Sony. I think they announced their presence with authority.. like how Dreamworks did with Shrek.. and how Pixar did.It's been awhile I seen something so unexpected and so cool."
tt4633694,Visually stunning. Great storyline. Great cast. Amazing soundtrack. Tear jerking cameo. Pop culture post credit scene of the decade. Thank you Marvel and Sony for making a Spidey movie everyone can love.
tt4633694,"So many have commented, so I will be brief. From an intriguing plot to wonderful characterizations using drop dead animation, this film works. About ten minutes into it it thought, ""This is just a kind of hip hop version of Spiderman."" But the main character is suddenly thrust into a world which he must learn quickly to manage. The canon takes a turn here toward incredible creativity. I avoid mainstream animation, but this has restored my faith."
tt4633694,"There was a lot of hype about this film, which surprised me because when I first glanced at the trailer I just dismissed what I saw as a direct-to-TV film. The hype gave me pause but at the same time made me wait so that it had time to settle into reality. Coming to it outside of the hype and awards, I was open to what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised. What pleased me was how creative it was in several areas of production. In terms of narrative it took the risk to be silly with its alternative Spider-Men, but was able to balance that with an engaging and reasonably serious core narrative. It managed to be funny, fun, engaging, and enjoyable all the way through.Animation wise it mixed many styles and approaches very well. Even when it felt OTT with the visuals, it still somehow worked and I didn't feel beaten down or tired as sometimes can happen with visual overload. The overall design of the film added to this, with good use of music, shot framing, and animation to make it feel very cool and fluid throughout. Production-wise, it felt like it ""got"" the sense of humour of the script and made that work more than it otherwise would have done. Voice performances also seem to get this, and everyone plays their characters well.Overall, it is creative, funny, engaging, and exciting for those that get into it and accept it on its own terms."
tt4633694,"I really enjoyed the animation, the art and the music. This movie has a real comics feel to it. However, it is far from being the masterpiece everyone is talking about.
The storyline is predictable and kinda childish. Nothing new or exciting around the many unnecessary characters, story doesn't make lots of sense.
Like many Marvel recent films, overhyped."
tt4633694,"This movie has one of the most boring and predictable story lines I've seen in a long while. i'm giving spider-verse 5 stars out of 10 because the animation is beautiful, especially the comic book spreads but the animation cannot hide the plot weakness, since if you know the title and the first few minutes of the movie, you largely know the plot. The only reason I didn't leave one hour into the movie is because my companion fell asleep and i didn't want to wake them up, but the movie is also painfully long. Bottom line, I would rather have spent my time re-watching Tobey Maguire's 2002 spider-man."
tt4633694,"This movie was absolutely incredible. From the animation, to the storytelling, to the characters this movie is completely one of a kind. It is easily the best looking animated movie of the year (no surprise there), but what really caught me off guard was the story they were able to tell in such a short amount of time. Each character has their own distinct personality and is given their own separate characterization without making the movie feel bloated. I knew I would end up liking this movie, but this movie has completely exceeded my expectations. If you enjoy superheros or animation you should 100% definitely watch it in a theater."
tt4633694,"Heads-up: I'm only going to be talking about Peter Parker in this review. I'll make a separate one for the film laterm I just feel like he deserves his own review. That's how great Peter is in this film.Into The Spider-verse reminds us why we love Spiderman so much, and does so in an original and humane way.I used to love Spiderman as a kid. I got obssessed with the cartoons he starred in as well as the original movie trilogy, one that actually helped me get interested in the character and marvel as a whole. But my love for this character, as most things, dissolved and it never got around to build itself up again, even after constant remakes and wonderful performances. I never felt that spark again, that love I felt for this charming dude was gone, dead.Then Into The Spider-verse came, and my whole world turned upside down. I felt a fire inside my stomach. There it was, that long-forgotten love for Peter Parker, one that I thought I would never experience again, expanding continuously as the movie progressed, hitting me in all the right places.I'd even dare to say that this movie made me understand the reason as to why spider-man is universally loved:He's an everyday guy with super powers, that's it. He's flawed but pure at heart. He's relatable. He belongs to the people. He's one of us.This movie's fresh take on Peter Parker is exactly what we needed to fully grasp that, how compelling this character can be without using any of his super powers. This version of Peter Parker is fat, subtly depressed, and tired, yet he's the most charming and lovable version of this character yet. It's something we haven't seen in quite a while, the genuine humanity that makes Peter Parker such a charismatic character, and one can only be thankful for it.Spider-man is cool again, but in a totally different, and perhaps even better, way. Just your everyday dude taking a leap of faith, giving the audience who relates to his struggles courage to do the same. This is what Spiderman can be and what he should be. A character that's ours, a character that teaches you that anyone can be a hero, that's the real Spiderman. This is the true Homecoming. Spiderman is freaking back! Welcome home!"
tt4633694,"I hardly post reviews but,
I Just watched Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse and OMG that is by far in my opinion the best Spider-Man movie ever!!! The story was so well written, the characters were awesome, the music was actually awesome, and OMG the art style they chose for this movie was so amazing and it was like watching a living comic book!!! Also, you know how sometimes superheros usually just come off as superheros and not like actual people well they actually showed emotion and development and oml just see it I geeked out enough 😂
Edit: if the creators somehow see this post
You created something brilliant with this film, And you made Stan and Steve proud. Good Job, Spider-Verse team. Excelsior!!!"
tt4633694,"I had high expectations for this movie and it didn't fail to meet them, this film has great animation, great humour, emotion, and heart. It has pretty much everything people would want for an animated movie."
tt4633694,"A coming of age movie for the whole animation genre, which stays true to its medium while nicely embracing the comics medium.A really moving movie with an ambitious approach, that surprised me at how much spiderman is instilled in my psyche...even as much as Superman is.The movie simply embraced how the character is a cultural phenomenon, and stopped treating it as merchandise."
tt4633694,You're out of your dome saying this is the 55th best movie of all time.
tt4633694,"Going into this I had high hopes but, was afraid It might not be as good as the hype says But, damn... This movie is underhyped. I loved every second of it. The animation was gorgeous, the characters were so fun and the soundtrack, flawless. The twists, you never see coming and don't even get me started on how beautiful the end fight scene was. This film is the best animated film of 2018 and in my opinion, the best film of 2018 definitely worth seeing!"
tt4633694,"The movie is visually spectacular (with the exceptions of a handful of blurry scenes filled with blues and reds, maybe for 3D purposes?). The colours and character designs are gorgeous. The dynamics of the action and the camera work is superb. All of this is ""all time great"" level.But... The story is ultra basic, therefore quite boring for about 45 impossibly predictable minutes. The jokes, while clever for a movie for kids, just didn't make me laugh. Not even one time. I'm not sure why. Also, the story lacks all kinds of depths. It's literally no sense, but I don't think is the focus of the movie, because...What really works is the theme of the film. Everybody can ""wear the mask"". And they proved it by showing it, not depending on melodramatic and cliched monologues, but with the story itself, that included different versions of totally different people ""wearing the masks"".The emotional bits also work well and kind of justify the boring preparation for it, developing Miles Morales origin story and his family and problems really well. Simple, but well done.
For last, the villains and its plans are just almost pointless and beyond under developed. There was probably no enough time to give them better and more coherent plans.
A good movie, visually superior with a well done and coherent message that actually works in the story (sometimes these superhero movies contradict themselves and they are about the ""problem with violence""... by using violence to solve the problem. No here. Spiderman is not white, black, female, old or young. It can be anybody. And they are good)."
tt4633694,"I went into this expecting a Marvel created film but what I got was a disney animation mess. The first hour of the film was pointless and boring. Story was non-exsistent bringing characters that were never on the screen long enough to be explained, the animation for the most part was alright until the bright colours start giving you a headache. Really not sure why this has so many 10/10 ratings unless ofc people are fake hyping which is what most of the reviews seem to show. Best to stick to what your good at Marvel and it's not this."
tt4633694,"Okay first of all, WHAT SONY? A good animated film?! A GREAT animated film?! Don't has reedemed themselves in my book and have created the DEFINITIVE Spider-Man movie in the process."
tt4633694,"This movie was honestly much, MUCH better than I expected it to be. Even all the trailers combined do not do it justice. It's thrilling, emotional, and hilarious. Its really a masterpiece in my eyes. One of my favorite movies of the year!"
tt8747560,"This is a movie I enjoyed immensely.Mu Ramaswamy as KD alias Karuppudurai and Nagavishal as Kutty were outstanding. I see a National award for Nagavishal this year. Brilliant dialogues and excellent presentation from the director Madhumita. Background score was perfect encore. Sarcasm aplenty, this will keep you hooked.This is a story about the old man KD who is wanted dead by his children for monetary gain and the orphan child Kutty who was left to die at a temple. The kid like old man and the mature Kutty form an outstanding combination. The story treatment is absolutely fabulous and poetic.This movie is more than the checklist that some keep referring to."
tt8747560,A well made movie - a rare friendship between a young-Oldie and an Old-Youth!!! 😊 congrats to Madhumita the director for a sincere effort to portray this rarity!!!

Kudos to the director and team for the hardwork and uncompromising authenticity in bringing out the best out of all in this lovable movie. The cast has been brilliant delivering what is expected of them. The chemistry between kutty n KD just went straight to my heart leaving a great impact on me.

tt8747560,"KD (a) KaruppuDurai Beautiful short story. Every scene is a poem. Madhumita such a gifted director to Tamil cinema.

tt8747560,"I watched this movie as a random pick without knowing any information or plot about this movie. As the movie gets moving, I was so hooked to it. The Thatha and Kutti lived their characters👌👌 Nice sentiments and neat dialogues!! Wish the movie was a little longer to see more of Thatha and Kutti. Hats off to the director for making such a novel-like feel good movie. Would love to watch this movie a few more times."
tt8747560,"One of the best movies I've watched recently. Simple, sweet and awesome film making. I'm deeply disappointed that this film didn't make much in the box office."
tt8747560,"K.d

Big applause to director madumita.A simple yet an important deep rooted issue with an essence of life to-do list charters out with an old -man having a great fun filled with emotions with grandson alike kid to enjoy the flow of life as it goes.The story was also eye- opening as I was not aware of the concept of Thalaikoothal. With in the community of the elderly. When I searched about this in Google, I really saddened to learn that this actually happens in india. I hope people would change their perception of the elders.Amazing movie, must watchable."
tt8747560,It makes u realise the that u never lived for ur self but for the expectations of others. And now u want to live for ur slef forever. With no expectation
tt8747560,"Every one should watch the movie ...
Awesome- acting each character,
Specially locations super ..."
tt8747560,"This is a movie. I enjoyed immensely. Story line was very good, entertainning. A movie with brillant mindset. A story with the taste of honesty and dignity. Must watch ."
tt8747560,"A simple but a powerful theme portrayed brilliantly by Madhumitha.
Ageing is not a curse but an experience and it varies person to person. KD's simple aspirations gets fulfilled with the help of Kutty. Both characters are intense and they have done a commendable job. I loved the expression on Valli when she meets KD. Interesting observations made by Hitler to find KD is more than Sherlock Holmes. Muthu plays a key role.
EQ of Kutty is beyond imagination and hope the society matures to nurture such kids like the HRC person.
It's a treat from beginning to end without any nonsense. Songs are very meaningful. Great movie not to be missed. Congratulations to Madhumitha"
tt8747560,"I watched this movie based on the imdb ratings and I was absolutely amazed. This movie is a must watch in a long time and that includes Indian cinemas and Hollywood alike. The performance of the leading two roles is so natural and real. The story is very interesting too.
I also have to condemn the practice of Thalaikoothal. This is one of the most despicable things I have ever heard and I couldn't believe this is happening in modern India. What a monster would kill their parents? Disgusting."
tt8747560,"We giggled and laughed thru the movie.. I'm gonna watch it again just so I can get all the little jokes I missed. My 8 year old was so invested, we went on to discuss family relationships, old age et al. There were many portions he didn't understand the dialogue (still not very proficient in Tamil), but, the screenplay and body language kept him engrossed. Mu Ramaswamy and Naga Vishal were excellent in their roles. We eagerly await Madhumita's next film..."
tt0060028,"I am 58 and never was a big fan of science fiction. Had seen episodes from Star Trek decades ago, but never was a huge fan. Well...recently have been watching reruns on a free TV channel. And I am amazed at how good and unique this show was....and is...especially for a show from the 1960s. Much credit is due to William Shatner. He's a good, versatile actor and was able to ""sell"" the script with a sense of seriousness and reality that it made up for the low budget sets, costumes and sometimes silly plots. He should have won an emmy for his acting.Also, loved the vibrant simple colors used on the sets and in wardrobe. The thinly adorned sets were visually enhanced by all these primary colors. The topics, scientific lingo and gadgets were also far beyond what most people were thinking of before this period. Look at all those cell phones they used in the series. And the flat screen TV monitors. Just way ahead of their time.Of course, Spock and the doc were great supporting cast members. But without Kirk, William Shatner, the show probably would not have worked."
tt0060028,"The 'Star Trek' franchise started with this show, a show that was undoubtedly awe-inspiring and ahead of its time back then. It still holds up now, even with its flaws.Sure, the special effects are often laughable and the sets are less than audacious. Some of Season 3 disappoints with even cheaper production values, less suspense, very contrived plotting that lacked logic and more cheesiness. William Shatner was never known for subtlety (apart from a few exceptions like 1958's 'The Brothers Karamazov'), but he does overact to an annoying degree and it can over-balance the rest of the show.However, the rest of the characterisations and acting are fine. Spock is the most interesting and most well-developed character and Leonard Nimoy is unforgettable as the character. DeForest Kelley and James Doohan are lots of fun and Walter Koenig is similarly memorable, same with George Takei.Music is full of energy and atmosphere. Even better is the writing, which is funny, intelligent and rich in humanity and the imaginative and influential story-lines that were full of suspense, intrigue and influential fun. The characters are interesting and their interaction is one of the high points of the show.In conclusion, hugely impressive and ground-breaking them, even though the flaws are more noticeable today. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0060028,"The science fiction series ""Star Trek"", called TOS (The Original Series) since its 1966-1969 three-season run on NBC-TV because there have been four other ""Star Trek"" series, has been made the biggest success of any re-run series in television history. Its re-run profits have been misused, in my view, by those who had nothing to do with the series' creation to set up the Fox Networl; in addition, novels of an authorized and of independent versions have been allowed to be published, many products have been created and sold, ranging from die-cut models to calendars, and a series of more than half-a dozen films have been made as features. But the nature of the series I argue has neither been understood not defined sufficiently in all the decades since its too-early demise and astonishing later career. The series was the product of an intelligent republican postmodernist; his central character for a 2200's starship-based series of adventure was an Iowa born activist named James Tiberius Kirk. Roddenberry's characters talked about individual development but generally confuted emergency ethics (altruism) with real-space-time ethics; and more than a dozen times, his central character was involved in actions a starship captain should not have assigned himself to carry out. The series' main creator, Gene Roddenberry, despite being a veteran both of military and police department experience, also frequently neglected or somewhat mishandled virtually all the details of physical importance to such a series--such as ship's equipment, duty assignments, defensive formations, weaponry, computers, transport, language and translation, color-coding, insigniae, Academy training, shipboard relief procedures etc.... Yet in spite of thee secondary omissions, the story-lines and plots were so strong in idea-level that above 50+ of 79 episodes in my estimation as a writer were above- average dramatic or comedic efforts, A look at the roster of writers and directors employed on ""Star Trek"" will demonstrate one reason why the show was so lively, emotionally-positive and dramatically compelling. Fine directors were used a number of times; in season two, Marc Daniels shared duties with Joseph Pevney; Vincent Mceveety, Gerd Oswald, Michael O'Herlihy, Gene Nelson, Ralph Senensky, Marvin Chomsky, Robert Sparr and others provided their talents. Writers also contributed story ideas or scripts in more than one case each , such as Jean Lisette Aroeste, Jerome Bixby, Margaret Armen, John D.F. Black, Robert Bloch and Theodore Sturgeon for example. And the series' head writers included Black, D.C. Fontana, Gene Coon, Stephen Carabatsos and Roddenberry. The famous cast was comprised Canadian William Shatner as Kirk, Lonard Nimoy as the half-alien pointed-eared 1st Officer, Spock, Georgia-born De Forest Kelley as the ship's doctor, McCoy, Candian James Doohan as Montgomery Scott, Chief Engineer, George Takei as Lt. Sulu, singer-dancer Nichelle Nichols as Uhura, and Majel Barrett as Nurse Christine Chapel. In pursuit of verisimilitude and an allegorical relationship to the Cold War 1960s, Roddenberry oversaw the elaboration of the Klingon race of aliens, stand-in for Communists, the Vulcan allies, stand-in for the British, and the Romulans, a Vulcan offshoot who were stand-ins for the Germans and Chinese. There are so many important story ideas on ""Star Trek"" TOS, especially when the series is compared to mere adventure programs of the same period, it is difficult to discern a pattern or to nominate the most worthy, separating the plot from its produced episode. The strongest included ""Return to Tomorrow"", ""City On the Edge of Forever"", ""Balance of Terror"", ""This Side of Paradise"", ""Bread and Circuses"", ""Mirror, Mirror"", ""A Piece of the Action"", ""The Cloud Minders"", ""All Our Yesterdays"", ""Mudd's Women"", ""A Taste of Armageddon"" and ""The Enemy Within"". Recurring themes included god-machines, the power and mystery of sex, humans' ingenuity, the need for self-discipline, the dangers of superhuman powers, the need for a government of sane people, the limits of logic and the problems of emotional extremity, loyalty to a charismatic leader, etc. If Spock was Eliot Ness in alien makeup, a normative human, the rest as depicted came across as promising humans with minor flaws that only got in their way under extreme circumstances. This was a show about the Federation--the flawed U.S. bureaucracy, and Starfleet Command-- the US Air Force and Navy, with details of the civilization of the future kept intentionally vague under such notions as ""speaking basic English', the Prime Directive of non-interference being in force and the crew never visiting Earth, etc;, Yhe really questionable elements of the show were the universal translator device, the molecular-disassembly and reassembly ""transporter"" device and the mysterious ""energy shields"". But in spite of technical lapses and postmodernist philosophy, the viewers responded to the series' many positive elements--the multiracial crew getting along and functioning bravely under adverse circumstances, the exciting plots, and the sense of a human future of all-but-unlimited potential-- qualities very often entirely missing from other series of the same era. Many of the series' episodes are worth viewing, by my lights as a writer, many times over. That is the series' legacy, I suggest--that it spoke for hope, tolerance and self-assertion, albeit imperfectly, at a time when angst and doubt were all-but-universal on the fictional screens of the United States."
tt0060028,"I have loved Star Trek since I first watched it as a child. However, the series which followed - Star Trek: TNG, Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and Star Trek: Enterprise - although generally still entertaining, seem to me to have left out the element which made the original series so special. Namely, the interaction between the characters, particularly Spock, Jim, and Bones.So well written, and generally well acted.With Bones (Dr Leonard H McCoy) being the opposite to Spock in terms of personality, so that the two of them always found something to argue about. Jim (Captain James T Kirk) in the middle, as a referee, displaying faults and strengths taken from both extremes. Extremes in the sense of McCoy being a very caring, compassionate, yet also highly emotional character. Representative of humanity, perhaps. Spock, the dry, cold, logical, emotionless Vulcan. Jim ""a man of deep feelings"", as Spock once said, yet also no stranger to thorough analysis of whatever situation the crew found themselves in. Bones seeking always to heal, to return everybody he met (whether friend or foe, human or otherwise) to as close to perfect health as possible. Frustrated by the fact that he (Bones) could not fully understand, for example, Spock's Vulcan anatomy. All three of them the closest friends. All three displaying unwavering loyalty toward each other - even though Spock would have found the suggestion of his displaying such a human quality to be insulting.The dynamics involved, the interaction, led to brilliant moments of humour. A science fiction programme to be not only enjoyed for the imaginative stories and the themes, but also for the humour, for the humanity.Which is not to suggest that the other characters were in any way second rate. Scotty's loyalty and his supreme confidence in his engineering abilities, Chekov's almost adolescent playfulness and humour, Sulu's loyalty, honour, and physical prowess, Uhura's dedication to duty and femininity in a masculine world, all added important and welcome elements to what I still consider to be the best science fiction television series ever.
The special effects were often laughable, the sets cheap and often reused, but the humanity, the character interaction, the stories, imagination, the brilliant writing... all added up to something very special indeed."
tt0060028,"The original Trek series established, within it's brief 3-year span, the panorama of an ever-expanding Federation of planets & civilizations, of which Earth was, in the 23rd century, a founding member (tho the audience never saw Earth during this run, except in time travel stories back to our 20th century). This series also presented mankind as, first & foremost, explorers, embodied by the trio of dynamic captain James T. Kirk (Shatner), his number two, science officer Spock (Nimoy) and irascible but kindly Dr.McCoy (Kelley) - but Spock was, of course, an alien (a Vulcan), an example of the alliances Earth held with many extraterrestrial races. They operated from a magnificent starship, Enterprise (one of several such ships in Starfleet), with a crew of about 400. Creator Roddenberry used the series as a platform to address many social & political concerns of the time. The general consensus of most familiar with the show is that the 1st & 2nd years were superior; the 3rd suffered in the writing & budget dept's. The best episodes: ""City on the Edge of Forever""-Kirk almost sacrifices Earth's history for the love of a woman. Almost, and he might've done so had he known her a little longer; ""Mirror,Mirror""-4 members of the crew switch places with their counterparts in a parallel universe, where the Federation is a hostile Empire; ""Space Seed""-the crew awaken Khan, an old-time conqueror boosted by eugenics, who returned in the 2nd Trek film(""The Wrath of Khan""); ""Arena""-Kirk battles a lizardian captain of an unfriendly race on a desolate asteroid; ""The Naked Time""-the crew lose their inhibitions, back when this was original; ""This Side of Paradise""-another one with everyone affected emotionally and forgetting their mission; ""The Trouble With Tribbles""-hugely entertaining romp on a space station; ""Shore Leave""-another romp on a weird planet; ""Journey to Babel""-Enterprise hosts ambassadors, Spock's parents included, dealing with intrigue & politics; ""Where No Man Has Gone Before""-the 2nd pilot which green-lit the series and the 1st with normal humans acquiring godlike powers; ""The Enemy Within""-examines duality of human nature; ""The Doomsday Machine""-space epic about a huge alien weapon destroying planets; ""Amok Time""-detailed look into Vulcan customs; ""Balance of Terror""-warships testing each other in space,introducing the aggressive Romulan race; ""What Are Little Girls Made Of?""-answering all questions on androids; and ""The Devil in the Dark""-which shows you cannot judge monsters by appearance.As the list above demonstrates, all the concepts we have come to know in later films and series (Next Generation,Deep Space 9,Voyager) were laid out just fine in the late '60s by some inventive writing (the first film to follow this, for example, merely reworked the episode ""The Changeling"" with a $50 million budget). The 2nd season also ended with a pilot for an unrealized spin-off ""Assignment:Earth"" which would have focused on human agent of aliens 'Gary-7' in the present day. It was back then, also, that omnipotent beings, such as ""The Squire of Gothos"" and the Organians (""Errand of Mercy""-which introduced Klingons) popped up to work miracles. The final 3rd season show ended things on a hysterical note as Kirk's body was taken over by an unbalanced woman - quite unPC these days but nonetheless intriguing & entertaining. The series was followed 4 years later by an animated version, which took place during the same mission. Finally, I'm still struck, or starstruck, by how, after all this time, it was this show that convinced me we really were on a huge ship traveling in space - more so than the later sophisticated shows (TNG) or the movies. Yes, the original is still the best, and it's easy to see why."
tt0060028,"In our household we are all Trekkies, so the ongoing adventures of the Federation Star Ship Enterprise constantly enthrall us. My husband will stubbornly watch only TOS, while my teenage son feels nostalgic about TOS, but secretly prefers Voyager. As for myself, while I find some of the Next Generation plots compelling and enjoy the dangerous drama of Voyager stranded in the Delta Quadrant, there's nothing quite like the characters from TOS. The series has an innocence about it unmatched in the later ones. My compliments to the late Gene Roddenberry, Star Trek's creator.Captain James T. Kirk is the audacious, impulsive, and womanizing Enterprise commander. In almost every episode he has some gorgeous new love interest, seldom exhibiting much restraint! Kirk frequently engages in physical hand to hand combat with his opponents, torn shirt & sweat being common. Yet he does manage to come up with some bold and brilliant moves such as his legendary ruse, the Corbomite Manouever. Perhaps his primary task is serving as referee between the constantly sparring First Officer Spock and ship's doctor, Bones McCoy.The heart of the series is Mr. Spock, the half Vulcan First Officer and ship's Science Officer. Actually however, Spock would maintain that he is the HEAD of the series, since he prides himself on his unfailing logic and lack of emotion. The inner conflict between his logic driven paternal Vulcan half and his emotional maternal human half form an ongoing theme. Spock possesses two useful Vulcan abilities, the neck pinch and the mind meld. The most engaging character interaction is between the logic motivated Spock versus the highly emotional ship's physician, Dr. Leonard (Bones) McCoy, who is basically a country doctor in space, a humanitarian leery of all this newfangled gadgetry. McCoy is famous in the Trek world for his expression, 'I'm a doctor, not a ----' (many phrases have been used here).Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott is a hot tempered Scotsman with a fondness for his native country's whiskey. Scotty constantly bemoans that he 'cannae change the laws of physics' all the while working assorted engineering miracles with the warp core and anti matter this or that. As for Communications Officer Uhura, she is most notable for her regular phrase, 'Hailing frequencies open, Sir.' To be sure, some of the episodes have less than brilliant plots, notably Spock's Brain, though the character interactions always compensate for any inadequacies. However, some ideas were masterful, including The Enterprise Incident, The Menagerie, and City on the Edge of Forever. The series took on issues of overpopulation (The Mark of Gideon), social class disparity (The Cloud Minders, with its clever cloud city, Stratos), and racism (Let That Be Your Last Battlefield), which involves laughable hatred between two races, one black on the left side & white on the right, the other race vice versa. I personally enjoyed The Naked Time (Nurse Chappel admits her love for Spock), A Taste of Armageddon (computer war), This Side of Paradise (Spock frolics), and Is There in Truth No Beauty? (the Medusan ambassador's incredible ugliness causes madness in the hapless onlooker). However, my absolute favourite is unquestionably the absurd Amok Time, with Spock's ridiculous pon farr mating strife.The Enterprise crew consists of a racially diverse group, with its black Communications Officer Uhura and Oriental helmsman Sulu. The ship's navigator, Chekov, is Russian...quite a revolutionary idea for that Cold War era. The cast are perfect in their roles, including William Shatner (Kirk), Leonard Nimoy (Spock), and all the others. Special tribute to the late Deforest Kelly (McCoy) and James Doohan (Scotty), who are sadly missed. This is the series that gave us such technologies as the transporter, tricorder, and cloaking device...high tech weaponry including phasers and photon torpedoes...futuristic games like three dimensional chess...miracle drugs such as cordrazine...and gourmet delicacies like Saurian brandy & Romulan ale. Some of the gadgetry gave a sneak preview of such later real life technology as computer floppy discs. In addition to the highly logical Vulcans, Star Trek gave us glimpses of such alien species as the honour driven Klingons and the sneaky Romulans (the Federation's two primary enemies), also the xenophobic Tholians, the reptilian Gorn, and many others. It treated us to the endearing rock like, silicon based Horta and the cute & fuzzy but all too prolific Tribbles (which caused no end of Trouble). And it acquainted us with such planets as Sarpeidon, Eminiar & Vendikar.In the episode Metamorphosis, we were all introduced to the heroic Zephram Cochrane who invented the warp drive way back in 2063. In constant demand is the dilithium vital to the warp engine's functioning. Star Trek also acquainted us with the United Federation of Planets, Starfleet & Starfleet Academy, and the Federation's much vaunted strict rule called the Prime Directive, which is frequently mentioned but universally ignored! Star Trek is simply an incredibly fun and entertaining science fiction series, though it was hardly appreciated back in the 1960's when it originally aired. Fortunately, it lives on today in re runs, giving Trekkies the ongoing excitement of regularly 'boldly going where no man has gone before'. Live long and prosper, everyone!"
tt0060028,"One must remember that Star Trek was made as a for profit network TV. The amount of money and total lack of any computer aided special effects. Was the norm, it a call for innovation, creativity, thinking outside the box, in fact they did not even have a box. So remember 10 years before Star Wars, Ten years before the the first Apple Computer, during the Civil Rights movement, during the peak of the Viet Nam War, Before man had set foot on the surface of the moon, a man name Roddenberry had a vision to "" Go where no man went before"". Exploring social issues, with appearances by some of the days leading actors, and actresses. Star Trek in a way is a time warp of the mid 1960's. The styles and culture are mixed in series. Indian mysticism, invaded the series just like the white album. I believe the most diverse cast and characters in the history of TV. The one high tech aspect of the show is and was it was filmed in color when few people owned color TV's. Live long and prosper."
tt0060028,"This show made all of it's principles into cause celebrities & in fact did the same for it's producers & almost everyone involved with it. This was one of the last series produced by Desilu studios it's first season. Then Desilu was sold to Paramont in order for Lucy & Ricky to separate their business interests after the divorce. Oh, but what a way to end their partnership. This original series & it's films & syndicated sequels have produced more money for Paramont than any other franchise. William Shatner became so famous for his role in this, that he went to to advertise Promise Margerine, do TJ HOOKER (a Cop series) in the 1970's for ABC. Then he kept working on other stuff until now he has managed to become a TV regular again on Boston Legal.Lenoard Nimoy(Spock) went on to do several other projects including hosting the syndicated series ""In Search of"". All the others came back for the movies as well. The big thing that made this series so popular was the plot lines which especially in the first seasons were so imaginative. These were from creator Gene Roddenbury who had learned his craft in the unusual Western series hit Have Gun, Will travel.Roddenbury made morality a major strength in plotting these original episodes. He tapped some talented science fiction writers as well for ideas. This was really his wagon train to the stars. This original series has a couple of fine veteran Western folks behind the camera with Gene L. Coons & Fred Friedberger who worked on action series like The Wild Wild West. The resemblance of Kirks fight scenes in Star Trek to the Wild Wild West are no coincidence.Towards the end, as NBC kept cutting the budget, the show suffered too, but by then, NBC still had not realized what they had & killed off the series. Thank goodness for re-runs, then video & now DVDs to keep this original going. The guest list for this series was small, but it had some excellent guest stars including William Windom, Roger C. Carmel, Michael Dunn (Dr Lovelass on Wild Wild West), Ricardo Montoban, & others (Most did guest shots on West too). It is one of the rare Science Fiction series to combine serious themes & comedy successfully & really be inventive. After all, to me it seems like these guys invented the cell phone style of communication in the 1960's. European Scientists are still experimenting to see if beaming people up can be done. What a legacy this series has left all of us."
tt0060028,"Star Trek may look cheap, but its stories are anything but; filled with depth, rich ideas, and executed with a great sense of adventure. Memorable, iconic characters representing logic, emotion, and morality in a whirlwind of political strife. Star Trek's meanings are timeless and will forever live long, and prosper. A must watch before you die."
tt0060028,"Star Trek is a classic series. William Shatner did good job and Leonard Nimoy did a good job. Star Trek had good writing, music, sets, directing and acting. I at first thought it was campy and silly but it grew on me. One of my favorite episodes was The City on the Edge of Forever. I own some of the episodes on video but I really want to get the DVDs. This series was created by Gene Roddenberry as was Star Trek: The Next Generation. I wish Gene Roddenberry never died. I like the fact that they play reruns on TV every week. Star Trek seems timeless because it is such a classic. Star Trek stands the test of time. Star Trek is one of the best TV series."
tt0060028,"Star Trek first came on TV here in Australia in 1968. I was a ten-year-old kid, and I thought it was great, but of course at that age, I missed the point of the social comment and deeper messages, and just got caught up in the fantasy. Over the years, I have re-watched most of the old episodes a few times and as an adult, I can see how well thought-out the show was, particularly when you consider much of the rest of 1960's television. Although I always liked to watch the original ""Star Trek"", I just can't get into the modern ones, although there is one spin off version that seems to explore the personal relationships a bit more, a concept that I find interesting. I think it's ""Deep Space Nine"", and I saw part of an episode of it one time, where one of the characters was talking to another about planning to spend some recreation time with the ship's resident Vulcan. The second character appeared unimpressed, and made a comment along the lines of ""You know, Vulcans aren't really known for their engaging personalities"".However, some people get a little too carried away by the Star Trek phenomenon. I found a book at a second book sale a few years ago that was a collection of articles from a magazine put out by a Trekkers organisation in the 70's. The extent that some people are into Star Trek is, frankly, disturbing. There was a forum in the magazine in which a contributor was carrying on about how the corridors in the original Enterprise were too big to be realistic(!). You see, when the sets were made in 1964, they had to accommodate 1960's TV cameras that were fairly bulky, so the corridor sets had to be made big enough to accommodate those large cameras. The book points that out. This particular writer was saying that ""Don't they realise that every cubic inch of air in a spacecraft has to be purified, etc, ... ..., blah blah, and space is a luxury, ... ... , blah blah, blah, ... ... , so how could they think that the designers of the Enterprise could get away with all that wasted space?"" This fellow was so-o-o indignant about that, but he accepted that they could beam each other up and down from planets, that Vulcans from another planet light-years from earth spoke in an English language that included ""Thee"", ""Thy"", and ""Thou"", as Vulcan's do on their own planet in the original series, or that the Enterprise could travel at speeds greater than light. He just focused on those big corridors, forgetting that 200 years ago, aluminium was a precious metal, and now we wrap our lunch in it, so that in 200 years from now, when the Enterprise is purported to exist, the technology they have may allow spaceships to have all the wasted space they want. Some people.. .. .. ."
tt0060028,"Never is the ""skip intro"" button on Netflix quite so irrelevant as when an episode of this classic series appears. From the iconic intro of ""Space...the final frontier, these are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise..."", the viewer is treated to original and often gripping sci-fi, decades ahead of its time. William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy are fabulous as Kirk and Spock and there isn't a weak link amongst the rest of the regular cast. There's plenty of fun and entertainment but there's also plenty of intelligent discourse and interesting philosophy thrown in along the way. Even the international crew is ahead of its time. Was this really made over 50 years ago? If you haven't seen it before, enjoy!"
tt0060028,"I do not base this on the Remastered releases. This is one of the three(the other two being The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits) intelligent series in the genre of the same era, helping to prove it worthy of attention and effort by viewer and creative forces alike, after the dreaded 50's(where the good pieces were few and far between). The tension, what could be called a feud, between this franchise and that of Star Wars, is obvious. It should be noted that they aspire to different goals... neither of which deserve being written off(if not necessarily for all tastes), the relative quality of the separate entries notwithstanding. This is a ""Wagon Train to the stars"". A core set of people going out on adventures. This does not particularly rely on special effects(the ones there are vary, with several spectacular ones). Rather, it's about the characters. The writing of them is mostly consistent and credible, throughout. The examinations of them and the interpersonal relationships are the heart and soul of the show. The episodes are self-contained, with little to no real two-parters, references to previous ones or overarching stories. My fiancée has a theory that Gene was(R.I.P.) a hopeless romantic. The humor is a mixed bag. A few silly and a fair amount of clever. Occasionally it was at an inappropriate time, after otherwise serious material, and not all of it worked. There isn't always a lot of action, and the fights alternate between negative and not. This has, as my wife-to-be points out, the softest lighting on women, almost ever. This got around censorship to discuss important subjects by doing it as science fiction, ""a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down"". The direction... now there's a subject that requires a wide spectrum for this. When it is bad, it can be terrible, but when it's in the positive end, it can truly be excellent. The writing, to some degree, the same. At its best, it is poignant(a certain three-word sentence is especially well-done) and holds plenty of food for thought. Then it can also be, as my better half puts it, 'hit you over the head obvious', as far as the message(and/or how they want you to think) is concerned. The third season brought about a precipitous drop, with, among other things, the majority(but not the entirety) of plots being underdeveloped and seeming rushed. The sexism is quite rampant, a sign of the decade it was made in, along with the short skirts and such. Apart from that, it's not all that dated. There are liberal ideas in this, not that that needs to stop anyone from enjoying it. This can be watched by all age groups, and each may appreciate it on a separate level. I recommend this to anyone who likes their sci-fi with a side of smart(albeit conceived as ""cowboys in space"", and one can tell), and/or fans of the actors as well as Roddenberry, and those who want to enter another universe... plenty of hours of exploration(what with the umpteen spin-offs) await. 7/10"
tt0060028,"Over-hyped, overpraised. Trekkies (or Trekkers, as they sometimes prefer) may adore this series, which probably takes the place of actual lives. But in the main ""Star Trek"" (created but thankfully not much written by that dreadful lack of talent called Gene Roddenberry) is tedious, repetitive and po-faced.Yes, the last accusation may be unfair. A series like ""Star Trek"" has to take itself uber-seriously or viewers will notice how creaky it is. With its spaceship hallways the size of tennis courts and the girth of its out-of-shape Captain who never works out shoved into his uniform like he was squeezed in it from a tube. Unless it took itself serious as death and taxes the (necessarily) cheap sets with the phony red or yellow backlighting for planets, and cheesy props that might fool a first-grader (""This stick is a gun 'cause I say so"") would stand out more.But it's also po-faced because it pretends to take on issues. I don't like shows that pretend to address ""issues"" because it usually ends up with a preachy sermon from some hack writer who thinks he knows better than the rest of us. I.e., in this case, that mantle best fits the preachy hack Roddenberry.Star Trek has a few good episodes. Having yawned through the series more than once just to say I saw it, I like experimental pieces like ""Hour of the Gun"" and humorous bits like ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" and ""I, Mudd."" Also good is the rapport everyone has in space. As I understand it this was not Roddenberry's idea; and, indeed, once his brainchild was launched by others, he came back to make the atmosphere unpleasant for everyone. Still, the friendship depicted between Kirk and McCoy seems real enough. And though some characters have flaws (such as Chekhov's outrageous accent) they mollify them by tidbits such as Chekhov believing his beloved Russians invented everything.Chekhov is not the only bum actor in the piece. William Shatner's Kirk is famous, even among Trekkies, for his overacting. Nimoy's Spock is emotionless because . . . well, have you ever seen Nimoy in anything where he emotes? He gave better performances in ""In Search Of . . ."" Sulu looks like he was carved, and acts like it.Poor writing, poor acting, tedious and repetitive stories (""get along with us or we'll blow you up""), lousy props and sets. Man, I'm glad I'll be dead by the twenty-third century, if it's anything like this pile of dingo's kidneys. Fortunately for the future, ""Star Trek"" already looks incredibly dated (watch how they fight, with those wide punches and the Laurel-and-Hardy law that states you can't do anything to me while I'm hurting you, and we'll take turns throwing punches).But the worst aspect of the show is its I-know-better-than-you preachiness. I hate being preached by by know-it-all Hollywood types. Or by people who wear pointy ears to conventions. I'm fine with people being fans. I'm a fan of some things myself (not just one thing). But I never dress up. I enjoy what I enjoy, then put it back in its box and get on with life. And if I lived ""life according to Star Trek"" I'd be a basket case. See it once through just to say you have then leave it to the pocket-protector types who live vicariously through it. Overall, lots of hooplah, but as MacBeth might have said, ""full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."""

Desilu execs pleaded with Lucy to forego this show. It was estimated that Star Trek and the other series Mission Impossible would lose the studio a combined total of $50,000 per week. Lucy gave it thought and ordered Herb Solow, Executive VP, Desilu to proceed! The show has become part of American cultureWithout Lucille Ball there would have been no Star Trek."
tt0060028,"Commonly known as ""The Original Series"", those of us engaged in an unhealthy obsession with Star Trek refer to it as TOS. TOS, began under the creative influence of Gene Roddenberry, with a brilliant,complex and intellectual pilot known as The Cage. The Cage proved to be too much for network TV. The first pilot was about as complex as a few episodes of Twin Peaks and almost as edgy. Plus it included a woman in a command position (Majel Barret or Majel Leigh Hudec, who later married Gene Roddenberry and eventually became Nurse/Dr. Christine Chapel, the voice of most of Star Trek's computers and Deanna Troi's mom in the Next Generation). The only major character who was consistent between The Cage and TOS was Spock (Leonard Nimoy's half-Vulcan science officer).Roddenberry and his collaborators did not lose hope, and took the advice of the networks seriously - shooting a second pilot with William Shatner replacing Jeffrey Hunter as the captain. The second pilot was later recycled as the episode ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"". The first, was reused and retold in the great two part episode ""The Menagerie"".To put it simply, TOS revolved around three main characters and a strong supporting cast. The three principal cast members were Captain James T Kirk (William Shatner, who previously made a major mark in Roger Corman's excellent ""The Intruder"") - an intelligent, courageous, humanitarian and righteous leader with an occasional tendency to bend the rules in order to get positive results; Mr. Spock (Nimoy)- Kirk's first officer and scientist, a brilliant half-human, half-Vulcan male who can calculate complex math in his head and see the logical path in any situation; and Dr. McCoy (veteran character actor Deforest Kelley)- a crusty, likable southern gentleman and expert surgeon. Women and non-whites were better represented in positions of respect in this show than most of what appeared on TV before it, and the show presented through demonstration (as opposed to rhetoric) an earth which was united, interested in diversity, and rationally governed by an interplanetary Federation founded by humans and their Vulcan allies.One of my favorite and most memorable Star Trek memories is when I learned the story of how the great Whoopie Goldburg was inspired by seeing a black woman (Lt Uhura, Nichelle Nichols) in a position of power on the bridge of the Enterprise, and even more inspired by the fact that a black woman was acting in a respectable major supporting role on a network TV show! Whoopie was apparently so indebted to TOS that she all but volunteered to play the important recurring role of Guinan in The Next Generation. It is also great to learn of the many members of NASA who cite TOS as one of their major career influences.The world of TOS is, of course, not the world we live in, but rather a world in which humankind has a bright future and the possibility of living to our highest potential as explorers, scientists, and enlightened beings. Yet, despite the hope represented in this future, TOS' characters face many of the same problems we face today - prejudice (Devil in the Dark, Errand of Mercy, Enemy Within, others), militarism (Errand of Mercy, Balance of Power, etc); the conflict between self and society (City on the Edge of Forever, etc); technological advance and social change (Ultimate Computer, The Changeling, etc); Cultural conflict (almost every episode, but especially Amok Time, The Tholian Web, Journey to Babel, The Corbomite Maneouver) and religion (many episodes, especially Who Mourns for Adonais, Amok Time and The Squire of Gothos). In creating this expansive and ever-expanding universe, the creators of TOS provided ample territory for allegoric examination of contemporary problems,without privileging any particular political or philosophical tradition over another.TOS featured generally good writing (though not as consistently good as that of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine), wildly experimental plots, consistent characterization, and a moderate and very well-used budget. The special effects are dated, and are really just adequate to convey the meaning, but unlike a lot of contemporary sci-fi, the stories, characters, acting and directing overshadow the special effects completely - rendering them somewhat irrelevant.The show's great themes, and the entertaining way in which is explores them has changed the mainstream approach to science fiction in more than just the television medium. TOS took itself seriously, and attempted to create serious drama seasoned with occasional humor, and more than its fair share of humanism and romance. Like the show, the characters were well imagined, well-developed, and intelligent. The starship Enterprise - also wonderfully detailed - did not carry any ballast in its crew. The crew showed many different kinds of people working together - united only by the desire to explore and learn, by rationality and discipline, and by a sense of purpose far higher than simple self-interest.What an inspiring vision of human life.As German pop musician Nena once said ""We are all a Captain Kirk"" -...well.... maybe some day."
tt0060028,"Guess who the single-most recognized personality the world-over REALLY is? Not Usama BinLaden, but Capt. Kirk.By consensus, City on the Edge of Forever is The Original Series(TOS)'s most-loved episode. It's high drama; a rather Shakespearian exploration of time travel, penned by serious s/f writer Harlan Ellison. It plays like a feature film. If anyone gets the courage (Hollywood is still terrified of the wrath of Star Trek fans), it SHOULD be remade as one.In ""City"", Capt. Kirk and Mr Spock (it's `Mr', OK? -`Mr' Spock; get it right) are credibly compelled to travel back in time; they must put right the change in history that Leonard `Bones' McCoy, the ship's doctor, caused in his cordrazine-demented state. The good doctor obliterated their timeline so nothing of the UFP or Enterprise exists anymore!Curious instrument-readings had lead them to an unknown planet. `Somethin--or someone--on this planet can effect changes in time, causing turbulent waves of space-displacement', observes Spock, as they rock the ship. While trying to plot the turbulence from orbit, passing through ripples in time, one of those ship-quakes causes the ship's experienced surgeon to accidentally inject himself(!) with a full hypospray of cordrazine. Characteristically for the overdose, he no longer recognizes his shipmates as friends but as `murderers and assassins'.
His psychosis is only temporary, but lasts long enough for McCoy to transport down to the very object of their search: the Guardian of Forever, an apparent rock archway on the planet. Unfortunately the thing is ripping through time (centuries in seconds), inconveniently fast for a human lifespan. In protective hot pursuit, the landing party follows McCoy to The Guardian.Ever the scientist, upon discovering and marveling at the source of the time-displacements, Spock berates himself: `I....am a fool! My tricorder is capable of recording even at this speed! I've missed taping centuries of living history which no man before has ever...' and then the cornered McCoy leaps past him, back through time. This is the only time in the series that Spock actively berates himself. It opens the door for Kirk's chiding Spock's scientific prowess in building a video player(!) `with nothing but stone knives and bearskins' in that `zinc-plated, vacuum-tubed culture' they've followed the frenzied McCoy to: Depression-Era America.As they desperately try to predict McCoy's arrival, Kirk and Spock meet Edith Keeler(Joan Collins) still at a very anonymous stage of her future political-activist career. What happens to history, and Enterprise, as they acclimate to Edith Keeler's homeless mission still packs a punch 37yrs later.Look for Kirk's double-entendre (but you must watch the WHOLE SCENE with Edith Keeler, as it plays off the sexual tension): `We have a flop, Mr Spock'. `-We have a what, Capt'n?' `A place to sleep.' `-....One might've said so in the first place'.The undeniable chemistry between Collins and Shatner, much to the chagrin of Bill's LEGIONS of detractors, I'm certain is responsible for the indubitable success of the drama. ST was always treated by cast and crew as serious science-fiction. To her credit, Collins joined their Trek seriously, but sadly only for this outing. Her career might've been far more acclaimed had she become a regular.Small wonder that `City' is the single-most popular episode of the original series, and it comes very close to taking the cake from ALL the many incarnations since! ST was at its best combining intellectual curiosity+sense of wonder with challenges to the heart. The humour was always just icing.The other two main contender episodes for that level of praise-from ST(TOS)-are Bill Shatner's personal fave, `The Devil in the Dark' (and were it not for the awful display of male arrogance-and-ignorance by all the miners, I would agree with Shatner); plus David Gerrold's classic gag entry from ST's 2nd season, `The Trouble with Tribbles'(1967).`Tribbles' has an important ecological message that was very sophisticated for its time (ie that animals coexist in ecological balance, and Heaven help you if you mess with that), couched in impish, trilling, and fuzzy, tribble-like humour; but because it doesn't challenge our ethics and hearts all that much, `Tribbles' can't win `Best ST Episode' even though it's A LOT OF FUN.`Devil', written by legendary ST honcho-producer Gene  Coon, was about human/alien humility. Human judgements, eg of beauty, should never be applied to aliens. `Ugly' is no reason to judge foreigners-or actual aliens-as stupid/less worthy. Information is a far better arbiter. Replete with positivism and 1960s churlish greed, `Devil' was also a precursor to Alien(1979), albeit about a `nice' alien: the Horta was a (midget-scuttling-under-a-)very-unattractive(-carpet)/highly intelligent mother of a dying race. Mr Spock's ecological sensitivity shines well to this day, compared to the miners' brutality.`Devil' was also lore-establishing for its depiction of Dr McCoy's distrust of transporters, and his appellations that he was `a DOCTOR, not a....'-in this case `not a bricklayer'; the best punchline to the joke he EVER produced.The only thing that irked me about `Devil' (apart from the laughably cheap set design) was the script's obtuseness about the economical value, even then(!!), of silicon. (The plot is predicated upon a bandwagon theory, that life could be based on non-Carbon elements; but to pick SILICON was unfortunate, since it was already the chief source material for semiconducting transistors in 1965!) Double-D'Oh!!!`City' has no such hindsight embarrassments. Instead, it reveals the rich and trusting relationship between Kirk and Spock as they take turns at solving puzzles and support each other's dignity. They still tease each other, esp. poor Spock about his alleged vulnerability to (human) sentimentality (which he takes as mild insults), and about his ears, which during the first season was still a novelty to audiences. How quickly things change.In my estimation, only ST-Voyager produced similar integration of science, wonder, philosophy, humour AND devastating drama. With `Eye of a Needle', `Distant Origin', `Drone', `Ashes to Ashes', and possibly `Timeless', ST-Voyager came close to replicating the emotional impact of ST-TOS' `discovery science' fiction.(10/10)"

tt0060028,"Star Trek is one of the true zeitgeists of TV history, a show that is about as unlikely to be popular as imaginable, but it caught on to the audience eventually, and today, half a dozen more series (not counting the *animated* Star Trek TOS), ten or so movies, and a mind-boggling number of Trekkie conventions, have come out of its wake. To be honest, I'm not a usual ""Trekkie""- I'd probably turn down an offer to go check out a convention, or pose questions about episode 2.5 and what cre # 5 wore on the planet next to blah-blah. But even when the show gets corny- and it gets corny and cheesy and reveling-low-budget often- it attempts to surpasses things that make it melodrama into the realm of smart science fiction. It's rousing action and daring-dos, and it also probes in questioning form here and there the nature of the universe, of man in conquest, dominance, subversion, submission, mind-melds, monsters, Platonians, ships-that-are-she's, evil goatees, and so on and so forth.I know, I sound like I'm not taking the show seriously. But as a piece of pop entertainment it can be as absorbing as anything that was produced in the period or since. Through the cheap sets and the very ""plastic"" special effects, and even through William Shatner, who can ham-bone at times like it's some kind of manic art-form (just watch the last episode of the series- before it was canceled- as Kirk's soul is taken over by a jealous ex-lover in hysterics, or the ""ship-called-she"" episode), it has good storytelling, and strong ideas expressed from time to time. One can't admire the episode when McCoy goes nuts and gets transported back to depression era America, and the hand of fate falls down hard on Kirk and Spock. Or the much heralded classic first featuring Ricardo Montebaum, who has just as much sneaky charisma as in the movie (minus the fake chest). Or when Sulu suddenly went all Errol Flynn in a manic state. Or even... well, this could go on a while. Suffice to say Roddenberry had it right: get some good writers, make things always punchy with dialog and situations of peril and the most asinine moments become enthralling TV.And, in a strange way, the original series carries a pathos with it, a charming quality with the stories and the characters, as well as some creative uses of mind control and the misuses of power, by the enemy or those on the Enterprise, that might be a little absent in the other series. While the acting quota might have been higher with Picard and the others, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy and all the others allow their stars to fill their shoes proudly, with many scenes that end up surprising those that expect the same shtick every episode (Nimoy crying, or singing, is enough to give belly laughs for about a week). In retrospect, it might be difficult to differentiate how much of the show works as legitimate science fiction theater and how much of it is fun cause of the 'so-bad-it's-good' quality that has it just a notch above most MST3K movies. But Roddenberry and the Star Trek crew straddle that line wonderfully, allowing moments of guilty pleasure and real delight in a series that worked, in its 78/79-ish episode run, consistently. It's the kind of show that you may start watching on TV a few minutes after it starts, and it sucks you in, as if in some Vulcan mind-meld."
tt0060028,"What can you say about Star Trek that hasn't already been said a million times over?""Next Generation is better"".... ""Started a Cult"".... ""Changed the world"".... And so many more.I'm surprised there aren't more reviews here to be honest. But then Star Trek is pretty old now: nearly 60 years. I suppose that only people of a certain age will have seen it during its time: the late 1960s. Seen back then - Star Trek was FANTASTIC! I'm one of the lucky ones who did see it then, and I can tell you I didn't miss an episode. I loved it!Seen today, Star Trek seems slow, cardboard and, for some, pretty poor. That's a shame - because this show is truly iconic. It boldly went where few TV shows had gone before, both visually and in terms of the stories and themes. These are still valid and good.Star Trek is legendary. It's impact on our culture goes beyond sci-fi. Is it any good though? Well, not by today's standards. Nevertheless - I'm giving it 7 because of its historical impact. It also gave rise to the excellent Star Trek: Next Generation (TNG)If you want to know what I think of TNG, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Picard, I have also written reviews here."
tt0060028,"I started out really liking Star Trek. I remembered it fondly from when I was a kid. It had some great ideas put on the screen that were probably new to a lot of television audiences, although not necessarily avant-garde to true sci-fi buffs of the time. But for a prime-time show it was really interesting.My mistake was watching it again as an adult. I knew that William Shatner had a bad reputation for over-acting in the show (bad acting, bad script writing, or bad directing? We may never fully know how much of each it was.) I thought I was prepared to gloss over that and I mostly was. However I was not prepared for the sloppy script writing and bad directing in general. I have now finished season one and every little bad line by Kirk and McCoy just grinds me down. Every little sloppy bit of science just chips away at my confidence in the show. Every sloppily constructed scene saps my will to watch another episode.I think the thing that disappoints me most in every show is that the ship is, for the most part, a quasi-military ship, but continually fails to live up to how even the sloppiest military might operate. I don't mean that it doesn't have the snappiest military procedures in the galaxy. I mean that is has all the military polish of ""F Troop"" or the stalag in ""Hogan's Heroes"". It's just pathetic and laughable. I know that to move the plot along, so-and-so has to escape and run amok, but the way that they invite suspicious characters on the ship and then fail to monitor them is just terrible. It wouldn't be that hard to at least have a better script that shows that they know better how to operate a ship than Colonel Klink. But they don't. The script writers are just sloppy.It has a captain and security team and weapons and almost everything that a navy vessel of 18th century England might have. But the captain is closer to Captain Bligh of the Bounty than Admiral Nelson. I'm not even a military person and have no concept of how the military is actually run. I just know common sense rules of what you might do when bad things are about. And the show consistently fails to live up to what a private in the army could figure out by thinking for five minutes.And for a science fiction show, it should at least have its head on its shoulders about scientific procedure. In the most recent episode I watched, ""Operation -- Annihilate"", they collect one (1) creature for testing. One? Really? Did the logical science officer, Jethro Bodine, gradiate the fifth grade? They're going to subject it to a battery of tests--battery meaning more than one, plural--and yet they collect one. Scientists in the 5th century AD knew to collect more than one of something if they wanted to test it multiple times. That was just one of the holes in the script that made the episode a big let-down from what I was expecting.Every few episodes I come across a brilliant show like ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" that makes it worth it. But in general my enthusiasm wanes with each new sloppy script. It may get better but I don't think I'll make it far enough to find out."
tt0460681,"Starting off I was immediately hooked onto the show. Mainly because of Sam and Dean being so much fun to watch. Jensen and Jared's chemistry on the show is so good. Other supporting characters too like Bobby, Castiel, and others also help the show. The show itself may be a little corny at times, but that's the fun of it. Yes the show may have gotten mediocre to down right ridiculous after season 5, however the first 5 seasons are entertaining, funny, emotional, and captivating. As weak as the later seasons may be, Jensen, Jared, and Misha are the reason why people still love the show. Even when the writing was at it's weakest the cast always delivered."
tt0460681,"PlotTwo brothers follow their father's footsteps as hunters, fighting evil supernatural beings of many kinds, including monsters, demons, and gods that roam the earth.CastWhere would you even start? Anyone and everyone, incredible leads, solid regulars and some great one off cameos. No Paris Hilton, I'm not including you.Verdict15 seasons, 15 years, 327 episodes, like it or hate it Supernatural was a remarkable success story made good mostly in my opinion by the fantastic cast who kept the show enjoyable because you came to care about them so much. This made even more intense by the fact any character was expendable, even if statistically the chances of them returning was still very high.The show changed greatly over the years, for me the first 4 seasons were the best. They had wafer thin storylines and more focused on ""Monster of the week"" writing and I loved that. From season 5 onwards it become heavy focus on angels, demons, heaven, hell and that took it in a direction I wasn't overly keen on. But again, the cast were so great I soldiered on through and though surprisingly that focus never shifted it was still very enjoyable and regularly threw us old school standalone episodes and plenty of gimmicky ones (Most of which worked).The perfect blend of comedy (With two guys with great natural timing especially Ackles), horror and drama though Supernaturals quality dips it never falls into the realms of being bad. Lowest episode I still rated a 6/10.Which brings me to an apparently controversial one, most people despise the final episode in fact many dislike the last two. Me? I understand the hatred of the final one, but had no issue with it myself. Was it cheesy? Absolutely. Did it feel a tad tacked on? Yep. But it worked, it returned to the simple notion throughout the show that what they do is dangerous and any hunt they go on could be their last, it doesn't need to be a big-bad that brings about their end the death everyone seems upset by made sense to me as did the beautiful finale montage sequence. Did it do enough nods to previous characters? Absolutely not, however that was their episode, it was the end of their journey nobody elses.And don't even get me started on the soundtrack, I'm of that right age, I'm a classic rock/metal fan and every episode was elevated by that. They always seem to pick the right song for the right moment, God Was Never on Your Side by Motorhead as the finale of Season 14 for example was fantastic. And Carry on my Wayward Son? What needs to be said about that masterpiece?I love Supernatural, I'm a big Supernatural fan and always will be. I'm so happy I got to do that journey from the start and commend everyone involved.Thank you Eric Kripke.RantsWho was your favorite character (Excluding Sam & Dean)? It's a tricky one isn't it, because there were so very very many. I adored Charlie, Bobby was a consistent joy but for me it was always Crowley. His unfortunate exit damaged the show for me, but the sheer quality overcame that. He was just, flawless. A couple of rants/monologues he did are among my all time favorite television show scenes. Can Mark Shepherd do wrong? If he can I've not seen it.BreakdownLeads are amazing
Remarkably on point comedy
Some great stories
Incredible array of characters
Best soundtrack ever
Shows length is such an accomplishment
Some ropey fight scenes
A lot of repetitious melodrama
A few poor writing decisions."
tt0460681,"Sam & Dean Winchester, the BEST brother duo. I love their relationship and the chemistry that these actors have on screen together really seals the deal on making the audience believe that the bond is real. I especially enjoyed the visuals they were good for the time that this series was airing. The whole spin on demons, angels, heaven, purgatory, and Lucifer was creative. I appreciate that it wasn't the typical angels are good and demons are bad narratives that are usually being taken. However I can admit that towards like season 13-14 things do get alittle redundant and repetitive, almost like they ran out of ideas."
tt0460681,"Supernatural is so much better than I expected it to be. I just binged the entire series on Netflix and it has quickly become one of my favorite shows ever. Jensen Ackles (Dean) and Jared Padalecki (Sam) were perfect for their roles and lead what is an overall great cast. I know most people hated the ending and while I didn't like it either, it doesn't take away for how good the show is overall. Most great shows struggle with a good ending, I just don't think that should take away from years of enjoyment you got from the show. I know this show was on forever and has 327 episodes but I still miss it. I definitely plan on watching it all the way through again sometime in the near future because it's just that good."
tt0460681,"I never watched Supernatural when it was actually on but a few months ago I thought I'd give a try. Well, I just now finished it and absolutely loved it. I'd even go as far as to say it's one of my favorite supernatural shows of all-time! Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki both did an amazing job as Dean and Sam. Their chemistry together is what makes this show so special. Like any great show some seasons were better than others but even the lesser ones are still worth watching. The only real negative about this show is the ending. It was awful, like really awful. As bad as the ending was I still give this 10 because I enjoyed almost everything else. I would love to see them come back for another season or even a movie to fix that ending but it is what it is. Anyway, I'm glad I gave this show a chance because I can add it as one of my favorite shows ever."
tt0460681,"You can really sum it up to one sentence. Supernatural family for life.I have watched this TV show since season two, re-watched it countless times, that's hundreds of hours of my life just for one show, and better believe that I don't regret a second of it. There's no greater joy than watching this show, I have the Winchester tattoo, and one day I will watch this show with my kids. Yeah. It's that good. It has absolutely everything that you want out of the TV show. If you're reading this give it a shot, at least watch the first two seasons and trust me you'll be hooked. I know that most shows get stail and kind of boring after countless seasons, but Supernatural never did. See for yourself."
tt0460681,"I love the story behind it and I think the show is funny. I love dean's sarcasm. Dean is my favorite character. I love this show so much. It has a spiritual meaning behind it and despite the gore and violence, the show brings me comfort and safety. I see why it's so popular. It's a very good show and it talks about how family is so important and saving people is a good thing. Dean is a very lovable character. I wish Sam had more personality. Dean has a great personality. What's not to like? I could go on and on about this show all day. People say it's bad after season 6 but not really. I see the humor in it and this show has a lot of character,"
tt0460681,"After being disappointed by mediocre to bad new shows like Threshold  and Invasion, I am glad that there's at least one new show that really  delivers. Supernatural is in a whole different league, with proper  style, suspense and great production values. This is a  dark, moody show that understands how to use the television medium. The  story isn't exactly complex, but the storytelling technique pulls you  in and holds your attention, making you want to know more about the  supernatural beings and the rules that govern their shadow world. I'm  usually not a fan of darkness and horror, but this show is effective.  It's dark urban fantasy and it has the potential to go a long way.  As it is, the show is way, waay above average, and I rate the pilot  episode an 8 out of 10."
tt0460681,"Just watch the first 5 seasons that actually has a beginning, middle and end. Those are the seasons that really worth watching. And then pretend like the rest doesn't exist because each season after season 5 is worse than the previous one (especially season 12)
And that finale... Oh GOD!!! It's just doesn't worth it."
tt0460681,"I really enjoyed the show at first and would always look forward to the next episode. Having said that, the unhealthy codepency between Sam and Dean, especially Dean who is willing to sacrifice anything and everyone so that he and Sam could continue their little adventure together, started getting old. I still watch occasionally and have enjoyed some of the characters that have come and gone, God/Chuck comes to mind as a good one and Crowley was awesome. Still, when I do watch, I find myself kinda hoping Sam and Dean get obliterated."
tt0460681,"The best thing I've even watched in my entire life. It has a little bit of everything.This TV show has played with vary different times lines, characters, genres, sub genres, character development, christianism and different types of gods and religions, problematic topics, importance of family, etc...
Simply a work of art, Supernatural is a work of art in all the sense of the word.Every season is a whole new different concept and storyline that somehow connects everything all too well. Every single little thing is tied together and meticulously used in order for that to happen. Just amazing."
tt0460681,"My favorite show ever!! If you are wanting to watch it PLEASE do. I know 15 seasons can be intimating but its soooooooo worth it. My aunt got me to watch it one day and im so glad that i listened to her because it literally changed my life, i know that sounds dramatic but its really true. Now that i've finished the show (and am rewatching it) i think that the first couple of seasons aren't the best but once you get to season 3 its definitely better. My favorite season is 10 because thats when rowena is brought in and she's amazing!! Now the ending wasn't my favorite but i don't think it was anyone's favorite."
tt0460681,"But! I love this, u got to love this. The tales, the ghosts, the demons, the Angels and so on. There is something for everyone. Its silly, its cool, its fun and you name and this series got it. There is just one thing I hate with this serie, it ends. First time I watched it, it realy didnt catch me but yes I had to go for a few more episodes and after 4 I was stuck. I have been counting down with a tear in my eye knowing that all good things come to an end but I will have the memories and the ability to watch it again from start and thats on my ""to do"" list withing a near future. So dont just sot there, go watch it."
tt0460681,"Supernatural is a one of a kind show. Previewing old tales and logic of beast that hunt human kind to this day. It makes you feel apart of a fight that could possibly be raging on today. With such likable characters that keep you engaged to the very end. I must say I don't agree with the general understand that only season 1-5 is the best works if the show. I rewatch this show every year starting around Halloween and sometime in the spring I find myself crying during the last episode understating the full cycle of a hunter is complete with a match made only in heaven.Dean is by far my favorite character, followed by cass and Sam. I love the dad even with all his flaws but understand how the mom becomes the returning figure in the series because of her toxic yet parallel relationship with dean. Funny how Sam is his dad and dean is his mom."
tt0460681,"This series gave me strength and great comfort in challenging times in my personal life.No matter what happens , this show gives me great comfort and happiness.The acting is superb, some seasons are not that as exciting but I have always wished they would never end.I strongly believed that Sam and Dean are my friends and they gave me great comfort to watch.I would always be a loyal fan to the series and I hope when the right times comes the show will be renewed .In today's world we live a channeling times so it's reassuring that we can go to this beautiful bubble where we can forget about our daily struggles.Thank you for the creators and actors to make this happen .I will always be a fan."
tt0460681,"15 years , 327 so only jumping if you have a lot of spare time on your hands.It has its ups and downs, ignore all the controversy around the external things, just make your own judgement, it sets a high bar which some episodes didn't reach, it made mistakes, it's perceived as a show that would appeal to women because the leads are good looking. They are, but it's not, it's unique in being one of the increasingly few shows that portray relationships between sibling brothers who are straight white men who can and do show they love for each other in the most extreme ways, it brings in an extended cast to help carry the load as time goes on who are likable, some storylines crash and burn , other soar, but there something for everyone to enjoy.It's well made, fans of cinematography will be able to luxuriate in the amazing lighting, direction, the sets are second to non and Canada officers her own take on America's back roads that whilst not authentic, give an atmospheric feel. Just sit back and enjoy the ride."
tt0460681,"It is not the same show it used to be, now it's so lame an full of nonsense. Sam and Dean keeping getting those really really lowend jobs, come on! they have been to hell and back, all the weak creatures should run away from them and not towrds them.Most of the episodes of every season are not about the main plot... Guess what? Those episodes suck!"
tt0460681,"I personally have been waiting to see a show based on spooky plots and this show delivers. Supernatural is somewhat endearing in that the main characters (the only ones who will be recurring) are brothers, however, the writing makes the characters more believable. They are different from each other, each with their own take on life and things that are not typical. I think as the show goes on it will continue to get better,though it is great now. I can't wait to see more of this show! Another plus is the little bits of humor placed here and there, which, when done right, is always a plus. Some of the best shows/movies are ones in which one minute you are sitting on the edge of your seat biting your nails and the next you are laughing at some irony or funny statement/joke a character has said. Also, having two very attractive men in the cast doesn't hurt, either ;)"
tt0460681,"The plot got worse, the characters became dull. supernatural has never been good at plot but the characters are so amazing you get absorbed in them."
tt0460681,"During the 90's I was a big fan of the X-Files to this day I still am. The X-Files had great stories and character development, which is needed for a great show. Supernatural has that from the very first episode. I admit that I missed the first 10 minutes of the show, but I knew exactly what happened and where the story was going. Most shows you tune into after the first few minutes your lost and you lose interest, unlike Supernatural. CBS's Threshold, may not live up to the X-Files, but Supernatural does. One final note, as long as the WB doesn't do any tweaking of the show this series will last for quite a few seasons."
tt0460681,"I was here from the start, at first it was entertaining, then the characters grow on you and it becomes something else.The show is with you when you leave your parent's home, then the show is with you through your studies and after that. You know these boys. Ok they are invented characters, but so well written and coherent you find yourself one day horrified you know them better than your own siblings.At some point i realized i was incapable of giving an objective critic about this show. I just liked it, whatever they threw at us.For the record, after the episode ""changing channel"" i had bursts of uncontrollable laughter everywhere for 2 weeks. That was pretty incapacitating. Even thinking about it 10 years later, can't stop giggling.Some episodes drew the tears as well, and not just a little. I'm looking at you, Bobby.Best shark dodging ever too. I hope there is a prize with a statuette for this somewhere."
tt1632701,Suits is one of those shows where once you start watching it you can't stop. It's addicting! The chemistry between the characters on this show is as good as it gets on tv! There are a thousand shows about lawyers out there but this is BY FAR the best and the most original one! I can not recommend this show enough!
tt1632701,"I don't even know how to describe how much I loved Suits. It's absolutely my favorite lawyer show of all-time. Even though it probably ran a season too long it went out with a string ending. All you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special. The entire cast...Gabriel Macht (Harvey), Patrick J Adams (Mike), Meghan Markle (Rachel), Sarah Rafferty (Donna), Rick Hoffman (Louis Litt), Gina Torres (Jessica), etc. Are all perfectly cast! Even the supporting characters are all great. Not a single bad character among them. If you're a fan of these lawyer type shows then watch this one as soon as possible because this is the best of them."
tt1632701,"SUITS is smart, sassy, clever, sophisticated, timely and immensely entertaining! The new series debuted with a full 60 minute story that establishes the characters very solidly, opens pathways for many story lines, and boasts an exceptional cast of fine actors. Here is hoping it makes it as an ongoing series, especially since it is not yet another crime drama! Not that Criminal Mains, The Mentalist, Without A Trace will lose their place among the best show on television, but with all the spinoffs on the crime shows, the available choices have been dwindling lately. SUITS is a lawyer show. Set in New York (captured, by the way, in beautiful cinematic vistas) it focuses on a very successful law firm, managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) who balances the talents of her two top lawyers, the smarmy Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) who is a control freak, and the very brilliant but egotistical Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht). There is a particularly appealing and very bright secretary Donna (Sarah Rafferty) and a beautiful paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markel) and last but certainly not least by any means there is Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) - a young lad who is extremely bright, has a photographic memory, dropped out of college because he took tests for fellow students and got caught, fell into marketing drugs by default for need of money so that he could pursue his dream of being a lawyer, and falls quite by accident into the role of being selected as associate to the brilliant but self absorbed Harvey Spector. This is the team of characters who are destined to provide fascinating substories as they interact. The dialogue (Aaron Korsh and Sean Jablonski) is clever, bright, snappy, unclichéd, witty, and helps define the complexities of the characters. The pacing is exceptional (directors Kevin Bray and John Scott) and the series has the appearance of a high-end movie - excellent cinematography, expansive development of story in well-selected locations - but most of all this is a cast that is worthy of attention every moment they are on camera. It will be interesting to watch how Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht grow into our psyches: both are exceptionally fine and provide a spectrum of the lawyer personality we haven't seen on a series before. This should be a major hit! Grady Harp"
tt1632701,"Always used IMDB for as long as I can remember and never left a review and for some reason I feel like I have to for suits.Just watched the final episode and I don't know why but it's reminded me of the last ten years of my life, the ups and downs and everything important I've ever been through with the people I love and have loved.The last episode brings everything together and is the perfect ending, and I have to say suits is one if not the best series I've watched. Perfection, and that's not a word I use often.The show has a slow but fun start initially and you grow to love so many characters, it shows the importance of friends of family and that sometimes life isn't always perfect but you should always be strong, persistent, kind and forgiving.After a number of people come and go it still continues to get better and better all the way to the end.Thank you to the show."
tt1632701,"It has been a while since I have discovered a series I truly enjoy watching. Some are way too stupid and then others are way too boring, and then some have horrible actors and the list goes on.However, in this little gem, everything is exactly right. The script matches funny and serious, silly and smart, everything at exactly the right amounts. The actors act well. Watching this show is a generally enjoyable experience which, I think, is a lot when it comes to some recent series.I would recommend this to anyone who likes 'House MD', 'How I Met Your Mother' and other series that are often watched to feel better after a long day."
tt1632701,"After finishing every available episode of House, Bones, Fringe, and Prison Break, I found myself at a loss of what to watch. So as I was browsing for new TV Shows, I stumbled on this one and decided to give it a go.I am very picky about TV series' but this one really captured me. After not expecting much, it really caught me by surprise how great this was.It reminds me of Law & Order but with more drama and a following into the characters lives. It reminds me of ""House"" in many ways. It features a strict boss that will do anything to get the job done, and an employee willing to do anything for his boss.It is certainly a new age show that will bring in audience from all ages from teenagers to seniors. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed with this show, as many new shows have disappointed me."
tt1632701,"Patrick J. Adams & Gabriel Macht both give convincing performances in the pilot, something sure to excel even more throughout the series.The script, acting, and quality are all flawless, as far as television goes. If you're looking to be highly entertained on Thursday night, then look no further. The subtle humor, creative plot, and enjoyable dialogue entices the viewer more with each passing moment.If you're into legal shows that include all aspects of human nature, including compassion, then Suits is for you.Hopefully this show continues to have the opportunity to thrive; it has definitely drawn me in and I won't miss a second of it."
tt1632701,"I'll first say that what made me keep coming back to finish the series was Louis Litt ""Rick Hoffman"" his character was so powerful, emotional and I loved to hate him and love him. Next I want to say that this show was made up of many great actors that would bring it home. Shout out to Gabriel Macht, Sarah Rafferty and the character Katrina played by Amanda Schull whose character development made me want to finish the series and not think twice after Megan left the series. Honestly, I thought the stories weaved together well as the writers and each actor did an excellent job. After finishing the series on Peacock I decided to come and rate the show. Not surprisingly this show doesn't need my high rating and everyone else already agrees that the show was well done."
tt1632701,"This TV series was really promising with good pilot, first and second season. And at some point it started turning more into soap lawyerish drama without this what it used to be. I would rate this TV show higher when it had been finished around season 4. It has it's own pattern that becomes annoying when you see it in every episode. But hey - you need to find it by yourself."
tt1632701,"I have watched all seasons.... unfortunately.Originally the drama was tense and fun. The bromance between Harvey and Mike was also really interesting. However, over time the sparkle disappeared and the magic of Mike's amazing memory seems to have disappeared alongside it. Instead of being fun yet tense, the show has evolved into a continuous screaming match and people panicking about mundane nonsense. Made up drama that feels too forced to be entertaining.Live. Die. Repeat.Every episode seems like a catastrophe for the firm or the people. They resolve this by yelling at each other or trying to be really clever. Unfortunately the clever seems to have turned into everyday unspectacular. The characters are now just bumbling ants without direction and without any capacity for passionate relationships. Even Mike and Rachel or Harvey and Donna are washed out.Worth a watch up to about season 3. Thereafter, it turns into a slow and agonizing death of a show."
tt1632701,"After watching the pilot episode I was pleased from what I saw. The episode was long enough to give us a glimpse into some interesting characters. There seems to be a lot to go around with both leads social lives and how they impact the secondary characters. There Is no shortage of eye candy. I did find some of the time lines a bit of a stretch, but nothing major. I most enjoyed how the writers took the time to give good background material on just about the whole cast witch I think Is becoming so rare, knowing this info helps to get into these characters from the start. I recommend this show to viewers who like a lawyer type show with just a touch of softness."
tt1632701,"I am very pleasantly surprised by this show and will certainly continue to watch it. The characters are likable and, with the exception of ""Mike Ross,"" a page out of real life. I can guarantee you that there is not a single lawyer at a high power NYC law firm that didn't go to law school. Additionally, no lawyer as green as Mike would be given so much attention. Here is where I will cut the show some slack- without such deviations from the truth there would be no show.Some reviewers liken this show to House but with lawyers. Sure, there are some common elements surrounding Harvey being cold-hearted and cocky yet excellent as his job. But this is where I want to draw the distinction: characters like Harvey actually exist in this world (minus the likability). There are charming, proud, extremely competent, rude, driven, and ruthless lawyers in every major firm in every major city. At some point it becomes a requirement of the job. Doctor House meanwhile is too much of a self-destructive train wreck for my taste.If you want to get a glimpse into working at a high power law firm, an investment bank, or any other high stakes pressure-cooker job look no further. Keep the insane hours, lose the friendliness, and amplify the cockiness and voilà: a glimpse of reality. This show keeps the bad but throws in the good, so instead of feeling like work, the show instead feels like entertainment."
tt1632701,"Suits is a compelling legal drama set in the heart of New York City at one of the city's most successful law firms. The story is centred around the firm's best lawyer, Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht), an egotistical, uncompassionate, charmingly witty Harvard graduate who will do whatever it takes to win – ""The best closer this city has ever seen""; and his associate Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), an under-achieving compassionate genius with an eidetic memory who strikes lucky by having the opportunity to work at one of the highest profile legal firms even after being caught for attempted drug trafficking and without the required qualifications. The show follows both characters as they face different legal and personal challenges in each episode whilst maintaining the gregarious and quick-witted rapport between the two.The show offers plenty of variety besides the law by developing the relationships of many characters inside the firm, ""Pearson Hardman"", managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres), a career-minded powerful woman. Jessica must balance between her two best lawyers, a devious Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) and Harvey, whose relationship is filled with rivalry and playable banter, is certainly one to make you laugh. The show also follows the stories of the beautiful Rachel (Meghan Markel), a paralegal whose test anxieties are stopping her from fulfilling her ambitions of going to Harvard to study law and Donna (Sarah Rafferty) a smart, sexy secretary.Besides the two leading characters, Suits is balanced excellently with an ensemble cast filled with intriguing relationships and an original and sharp script combined with the beautiful backdrop of New York City to make this a thoroughly enjoyable TV show which I can't help but grin ear-to-ear from start to finish and I hope it continues its high standards for seasons to come. Suits is brilliant."
tt1632701,"when i first heard about this TV series i thought why bother its probably stupid ! how good could it be ? but then i thought you know ill watch the pilot and give it a shot , why not ? before i knew it my eyes were glued to the screen from beginning to end and i enjoyed it to the fullest . this show in a way reminds me of ""house MD "" a TV series with a lot of knowledge and brains and in the future will show many law cases which will be won by these guys , a top of the line lawyer named Harvey and a genius without a degree named mike who when hears anything or reads anything remembers it forever . and i strongly recommend this TV series to anybody who likes to enjoy themselves because trust me this TV series ain't boring !"
tt1632701,"I have just finished watching the whole show, from S1 to S9. Not quite a binge, but I put most other viewing aside.
Like other reviewers, I felt that the the plot lost its way a bit somewhere around midway. But I don't see it as a serious lapse. It held my attention to the end, and I think it was the humour, as much as anything, that kept me going.
As far as the comedy element goes, Rick Hoffman was outstanding. Delicious laugh out loud scenes that continued sporadically right through.
The main flaws were some of the repetitive dialogue. At one point I was getting really annoyed that each episode contained at least one character asking another to look in the mirror. And there were many others. But I could easily forgive that, because the pace hardly ever dropped.
The acting of all main characters was excellent. The flashbacks were well-handled and successfully explained how the key players behaved.
I wondered whether to give an overall 7, but I think 8 is justified by the sheer scale of the show, and that the drama was maintained for so many episodes."
tt1632701,"I can't recall the last time I watched a series where I was glad to just binge watch episode after episode and keep looking forward to the next episode.Gabriel Macht is SOOO dreamy. Patrick J. Adams is adorable and all of the cast are perfect in their roles.I'm glad Netflix now has the show on, so I can watch a few a day after a long day at work. It's engaging and relaxing and none of the characters get on my nerves. Not even Lewis Litt! Lol!As for IMDB, I understand character limits for reviews, but the requirement of 600 characters just to say I really enjoy something is a bit much. I LOVE SUITS!!!"
tt1632701,"This was an amazing show with a cast of actors who have great chemistry together. After setting aside the hour and a half allotted for the show, I was happy I did! It follows a young adult who is struggling with his life who finds himself thrown into a job as a lawyer after he is hired by a big shot, charming 'closer. After the pilot episode, I am hooked and look forward to seeing this show on USA every Thursday! As long as they keep the comedy and drama coming, I will be an avid watcher for life."
tt1632701,"The show started out great, but went downhill fast.
Almost everything that made the show great is gone by season 4."
tt1632701,"When I started the series, I enjoyed suits and would probably give it an 8.I quickly realized that it fell into a cycle that was unbreakable :The same things seem to happen over and over again . It just becomes so repetitive that the "" new "" narratives just aren't interesting enough to satisfy you as the viewer.They also seem to exaggerate quite a bit at times so it really does not feel realistic at all."
tt1632701,"Update on 8/21/2019There's no sense to go on. These characters leftover now only delivered hollow dialog to each other by verbally creating situations in those empty office buildings. This series should call quit when Mike and his wife seek new location to have a new life and lifestyle. It's already become a nuisance to watch this new season's every episode so far, so painful and annoying. Please call it off whenever you could. Have a new life......
========================================================
Well, after some of the most important roles in this series left, the newest Suits S08 has become such a painful hollow slow cooker without any tasteful ingredients in it and kept deteriorating episode after episode. We can see so clearly that this series' budget has been cut and decreased hugely, so what we see in Season 8 is just a bunch of the familiar faces added another two walking around in an almost empty leased office space in business suits, yadayadayada like a bunch of old wives just delivering boring dialog to each other, or some boring internal fights over ""whose name should be added on the wall"" and nothing else. The office is almost as empty as a theater stage with some furnitures and several actors. Nothing worth seeing anymore, just like the Emperor's Clothe, under it, Nothing. It's time to wrap up and beg off."
tt1632701,A very lovely would say one of the best series ever watched.. you feel that it's all happening around you are part of it you feel to become Harvey or Mike. Such intensity you cannot stop emotions rushing in you. Amazing must watch series
tt1830379,"Top Boy is a well written, well acted British crime drama that is a must watch for any fan of this kind of genre. People calls shows underrated all the time but this is definitely underrated. It's one of those shows where once you start watching it you can't stop. The cast does such an excellent job sucking you into their world. The acting and writing is just so good that they really make you care about their characters and what happens to them. Each character has depth and this show shows that each of their actions have huge consequences. The only bad thing I have to say about it is that the seasons are so incredibly short. I really can't recommend this show enough!"
tt1830379,"I highly recommend Top Boy for any fan of gritty, intense dramas! I didn't watch it until recently because of everything I heard about it and I'm so glad I finally gave it a chance and that Netflix made the incredible choice of bringing it back because it's as good as ever!"
tt1830379,Oh my god Netflix have gone and done it. They have made a great series even better. I think this new revival is even better than the original made by channel 4. Hopefully they commission another series.
tt1830379,"Haven't written a review in years but had to rectify this wrong.It's really unfair how stupid movies and series get thousands of reviews and recognition but gems like this only have 30 odd reviews. Hopefully now that Netflix has picked up season 3 and produced a masterpiece, maybe it will start to get the recognition it deserves.For people watching the 3rd season first, you can watch it as a standalone as even though it is a continuing story line from past seasons like Narcos, etc, you will still understand whats going on and will really connect with the characters.All in all a very gritty and realistic ride. The character development, suspense, twists are great and at the end of it you will be left wondering why you haven't heard of or seen this series before.P.S - The ending of season 3 left very mouth watering prospects for season 4 to fulfill."
tt1830379,"This series is everything you can possibly want, compelling, gripping, absorbing. If you enjoyed The Wire or The Shield, this is the show for you. I accidentally ran across it on Netflix and was captured instantly. I watched it back to back and then watched all 4 episodes again. Excellent. Its about time there is something different and unique to watch. Looking forward to Season 2. This is a solid piece of work. The theme is more than just hoodlums, drugs and violence, it received just a strong audience response because the acting is so precise you feel compassion and understanding. You begin to root for the bad guy and want the drug deal to be executed, and the villain becomes somehow good. This fantastic show reaches beyond just entertainment, it reaches your heart. A must see."
tt1830379,"I can't honestly remember when I last watched a series back to back all in one sitting. This series had me gripped from the start and I just had to watch it all back to back.
Really great storyline and fantastic acting from the entire cast - they were all brilliant.
I cannot recommend this highly enough - I can see why it scored so high. I am impressed.... Well done!"
tt1830379,"This show is flawless in every way.The story, acting, music, atmosphere, just blew me away. The ending was emotional and must admit, I hated Dushane at the close but hands down, the best thing I've watched in years.Outstanding performance (especially Sully and Dris).A truly brilliant show."
tt1830379,A very raw gritty look into the darker side of London's ghettos & the reality of everyday life done flawlessly in this 3 part series from composition to the cast it's a masterclass and definatley Top of its game.. a solid 10/10
tt1830379,I've largely avoided this series because I thought it would be bad story bad acting with posh drama school teens as gangsters n hood rats. I was wrong ... It's a great story very well crafted n filmed. The acting is very good too. So I came late to the party... But at least I'm here now.
tt1830379,"This would have gotten 8 or 9 stars from me, if the fight scenes hadn't been recorded by someone with adhd and parkinsons, after drinking 10 cups of coffee."
tt1830379,"The first thing to point out, there are 4 series in total but 3 & 4 are the recent releases, c. 10 years on from the original 2. S3/4 are significantly better than the first 2. You don't need to watch the first 2 (on Netflix as Top Boy: Summerhouse - separate title). But it does give you some insight into some of the characters and the dynamic between a few of them, Dushane and Sully in particular, and the latter's relationship with Jason, which all seems a bit random off the bat in series 3.This review is mainly for S3/4:This really is a gripping watch. A significant improvement on the first 2 series mainly down to the brilliance of Michael Ward (playing Jamie), who completely steals the show. This is backed up by a great performance by Kano (Sully), who to my surprise is a very capable actor who's brilliant in this. Asher D as the main character is ok, and there are brilliant supporting acts all around, in particular from Jaq and some of the child actors ('Ats' is really good!).The first episode, set in Jamaica is a little slow. I spent half of the time trying to understand some of the thick accents but stick with it as the show moves forward quickly.I could write all day about how good this show is. The characters make it great, the best dynamic is the hot and cold relationship between Dushane and Sully, along with a similar up and down relationship between Jamie and his 2 brothers. Then, away from these friendships, who will make it to 'Top Boy' status. The difficult part as a viewer is you're rooting for all 3!The show is mainly a hard hitting gangland thriller but does also feature some extremely hard hitting storylines. As inevitably on a new Netflix show, it does walk a thin line into woke storylines for the sake of it in S4 but it delivers them so well, the majority fit in with the exception of a gay prejudice attack, which has no real relevance. The very powerful storylines are a windrush style deportation and an extremely well done mental abuse/coercion plot. This was downright uncomfortable viewing at times but was integrated into the man plot with a fantastic villain. There's also several sub plots on kids getting into working for the drug lords, which gives insight on the challenges a lot of kids face IRL in these areas.These things are going on while all the while 'Top Boys' are vying for position as the king of summerhouse, not always with each other too, there are lots of external threats and gangs that cause mayhem.All in all a brilliant show and I'm really looking forward to the upcoming series 5.Finally - the ought to put a 'teeth kissing' disclaimer in series 3 & 4, as almost every sentence either starts or ends with one.....you get used to it."
tt1830379,"Nothing special, not understand the high ratings, is literally more of the same, plus, very slow."
tt1830379,"Top Boy is a show that I can really connect with, not only is it set in home (London) everything about this is so realistic, you'll be shocked upon watching but it is a fact. Top Boy is Incredible. Dushane Hill (Ashley Walters) is a character who has alot of problems that are always in need of sorting, being the top boy of the streets can't be easy.I really enjoyed Top Boy: Summerhouse, everyone was talking about it when it was around, now we have Top Boy with a new addition to the series Michsrl Ward, playing Jamie, Big brother who is also playing dad to his two younger brothers awhile being on the road trying to gain the title Top Boy.All in all I loved every second of this, if you're looking for a programme that gets right into the ghetto then you're in the right place! This is phenomenal show that deserves all the respect and praise it gets. Kano plays Dushanes right hand man Sully, and out of everyone I would say he is the best, you'll see what I mean when you watch it, everyone played their roles so good and it's definitely worth watching, by far the best crime drama, a perfect hood show.Highly Recommend this show, it's so good, who is your favourite Top Boy?"
tt1830379,"Wagwan. I don't want to ramble on but bloody hell, this series never ceases to amaze me - besides the fact that I have to wait for Drake and whoever else pays for Ronan to start writing the next season. Get the man a pencil fam. Yes, it may be slightly predictable at times but all in all, the acting, cinematography and general vibe is brilliant innit. Sully.... Say less."
tt1830379,"Drama set in London about two friends and their gang trying to get rich the only way they know how; selling drugs. The cast is a mix of actors and grime artists such as Kano and Scorcher all of whom are from gang London so they know how the character should be therefore giving their characters true realism. The shows gives an inside look into London gang lifestyle on the estates of London and how kids become 'shotters' for the more notorious people on the estates. Each episode of Top Boy has a gripping storyline which keeps you wanting more; one millions viewers for a urban C4 show cannot be wrong. Not only is the acting good, but the soundtrack is phenomenal, showcasing a lot of London grime artists."
tt1830379,"I have reached Season 3. I have not left a review in years; but this show changed my mind. The casting is as inspired as 'The Wire' was. It's also interesting to note that (like The Wire) the plot starts to evolve, and spin off. As life does. Real estate and gentrification rears its head. No compromises on the dialects.I got to say that one of my favorite scenes is in Season 3 when the 3 brothers are sitting on a bench that commemorates their mother, and Jamie hands off a few bills to his younger brothers. The look on the young ones face, when he realizes he got less. No words, but priceless."
tt1830379,"Those rare occassions where season 2 is a level up. Take a bow Team Top Boy. Gritty, slick, and superb acting. Love the nuances and emotions this season brings. A series whixh does not try too hard to be cool, that's what makes it better."
tt1830379,Cracking series! One of the best I've seen from the acting to the whole story line. Better be another series.
tt1830379,Netflix did well to revive top boy after channel 4 dropped it for this new season it is really worth it
tt1830379,"I have loved TopBoy from the original series and was so happy it was resurrected, the first 2 new series gave me everything I wanted and was joy to watch. I loved the characters and Sully in particular was the Topboy the enacting was great and storylines were well written, Sadly the final series has left me underwhelmed, the six part series just felt like it was rushed, there is no real storyline flipping from immigration protests to evri toon protests Tia little bit of what we all tuned in for.To me Sully again showed he was the Topboy and Dushane just did not fit the part, but what I think let me down was the ending, I have seen many shows that failed to deliver and I think this unfortunately is one of them, the last part was entertaining in parts and showed us all what we expected from the series but it was predictable that as we knew this was the last season all dates were obvious."
tt1830379,"Being a non native speaker, I gotta watch the show with subtitles, to really not miss on anything said. The set n setting are well done, some projects, low income, crime is abundant. Different characters battle for the crown, to rule the estate, the streets.I just enjoy about everything this show does, but one thing: they introduce and build characters, make them interesting and that you want to know more about them, then they simply disappear or do not have any matter regarding the storyline. Aside from that, this show is definitley mint. Nine outta ten and hoping for more. Very well executed by directors, producers and actors. Thank you for the entertainment."
tt1830379,"I don't understand alle the 8, 9 or 10 for this series. It's bad acting, lame script and boring. Just stopped after episode 2 - waiste of time seeing this."
tt0409591,"I've seen a lot of anime throughout the years. I've seen what people call the 'good stuff', I've seen the 'bad stuff'. In time, I realized and accepted that not everyone is going to like something, or dislike it. No matter what the anime (or movie, or book, or game, etc.) it boils down to personal preference. So, how do you know if you'd like something you've never seen but heard so much about? When I first started Naruto, I saw the potential in it. From the first episode, they presented a distinct setting with distinct characters. Sure, archetypes were being followed (the boy dreaming of becoming big, the old grandfatherly figure, the teacher, the rival). The first episode showed emotion and depth to its main character and what he will struggle with, along with the dynamics of his interaction with other characters and their quirks.Cut about ten episodes later, the plot arc currently being followed felt to me like it was not going to matter much to the main story. Some episodes had drawn out battles, and I got that feeling that the anime would be the type where they would go from different area to different area, developing their skills and learning moral lessons and such, but there would be no grand plot, no B story, that tied the series together. I also worried it would fall into mediocrity. Without giving anything away, by the end of that arc (about 19 episodes in), my mind was changed.Having seen all of the series up to the current episodes, I can say at least for myself that at its best Naruto is a deeper anime than some give credit to, and can be quite addicting. A strong focus is on its characters as they develop throughout the series and there are moments of real emotion, tragedy, intensity and even just amusement. It's not perfect, as there are slow times in the series (and the cartoon suffers from tricks to get as many episodes out of the original story as they can), and I won't say everyone will end up liking it but I can say it had unexpectedly become one of my favorite anime."
tt0409591,"Everyday after school I went to the store and bought a bottle of soda and some snacks, and watched Naruto when i came home. Some months later I was borderline obese. 10/10 would recommend."
tt0409591,"You're probably thinking: ""well I could just skip the fillers by searching filler episode up."" That's fine but that's not the only issue with the show. It's that even in nonfiller episodes it feels like they are buying a lot of time. If the show was compressed to maybe 90/100 episodes then it would be amazing. The hype moments really are hype and the ninja stuff is cool."
tt0409591,"Last year my roommate got me hooked on watching Naruto. I had never really been a big Anime fan. Shows like DBZ and Inuyasha never really appealed to me. I had seen a few episodes of Tri-Gun and found it rather interesting but the story of Naruto is what really drew me in. The quality with which it is written is very well done. And is not centered entirely around fighting, there actually is a plot here. The story is about 3 ninjas as they progress from genin level (beginning ninjas) onward to some rather high lvl battles and their hardships along the way. Each of these characters is well described with a rich background. And each character possesses unique abilities, none of which I have found boring or pointless so far. Currently I have read all the manga and have all the Anime downloaded. It is a truly excellent series. I fear that if they do bring it to the US. that sites that provide us with the anime may not be allowed to continue providing us with the show and if it comes to US television it will be edited because they will probably intend for kids to watch it and in it's original state it is entirely inappropriate and in no way should be compared to a Saturday morning cartoon show. The different jutsus are exciting to watch and well thought out. Battles can tend to last multiple episodes but to me that does not matter, the flashbacks just add to the storyline. The quality of the actual animation which can really be seen during the fight scenes is unbelievable. They truly have some very talented artists working for them. Lastly, the music is top notch. The intro's are extremely cool and the music in the actual show is also very well done."
tt0409591,"For me there is nothing above naruto. I just can't get my mind out of this anime. Once you entre the naruto world, there's no coming back❤❤❤ I love every bit of the show (leaving some fillers). If you didn't watched naruto you're missing paradise of earth💕💕 10 rating is too less for naruto."
tt0409591,If u r looking for a good anime to watch then watch naruto. I have watched 7 anime in my life and Naruto is still my favorite. It's an amazing story with the best character development I have ever seen. If u haven't already watched it then watch fast!
tt0409591,"Naruto is...how to say? Magnificent, glorious and entertaining. Its almost flawless in the way it presents itself. The overall story is new and refreshing. The characters are inspirational and beautifully portrayed. The fight scenes ae overall breathtaking and neat. The drama in here is very emotional and moving. The jokes are well executed but sometimes overdone. Most people complain how most of the characters are unreal. But who cares. Their fun and feel real once you give the show a chance. If you ain't an anime fan then give this show a chance. Those who are anime fans will simply love it. There is nothing really to hate about it. Pure perfection. 10/10"
tt0409591,"Okay, let me start out by saying this show should be Rated TV-MA for the following Reasons: 1. Disturbing Violent Content, Harsh Language, Horror Effects, Gore, sexual content, Sexual Inuendo, Brief Nudity, Demonic Themes, Unsettling Images, Grossout Violent content and Torture Now don't get me wrong, when i first started watching this show, i was pretty damn sure it was gonna be another one piece or dragon ball Z knockoff but to my surprise this show has depth, drama, comedy, Horror and Suspense all rolled into one...granted some of the episodes are like your worst nightmare, however this isn't like dragon ball Z where most of the villains talk so much crap that it ticks you off, no its quite the opposite, save 1 and thats The lead Villain which they wont let me say who really makes me mad, he's such a sick freak that it makes the Squad 12 captain from Bleach look tame, yeah he's that bad and Kabuto, god that kid really made me mad, it makes me wish they killed both of them off in the 4th season and did away with it but, they had to drag it over too Naruto Shippuden....which is by far more graphic than this one....Naruto is my number 2 favorite anime, with One Piece being my number 1 and Dragon ball Z being my 9th favorite...anyways, thats all for now"
tt0409591,"This show first grabbed my attention when I saw clips of it in the game for the Xbox 360 called ""Naruto: Rise of a Ninja"". After I played that game I just had to watch the show and I am glad I did as it turned out to be a very fun and complete show. The characters are what I love most about it as we follow Naruto on his quest from being a goofball with seemingly little talent to someone who could defend his village if need be. You get to see him join a team with two other rookie ninja Sauske and Sakura and there teacher Kakashi as they head for a town in trouble from the local mob boss. You then go on a journey with them as they must take a test to see if they are ready to take the next step up in class of ninja. There are other characters here to meet and the show just gets more interesting as they must survive an assault by the sand village and try and find a new leader for the village. A friend departs to seemingly join the villain and then you have a few stories not from the manga and it wraps up in a nice story about a group going after Garaa, also not in the manga, but still good. The show has a few minor gripes from me, the first few shows in the series seemed to go over a lot of the same things at the beginning of the show chronicling what happened at the end of the previous show, also there are a lot of flashbacks especially in earlier episodes as well. The final few shows after the battle between Naruto and Sauske at times are a bit weak too, as they never had these stories in the manga therefore they sometimes do not really fit in the main flow of the show. One case had Naruto who is all about training and getting better is seemingly afraid to fight another young ninja Rock Lee. All in all though the show is very entertaining. The humor works and the action is great. The show also has very good music as well. The characters that are in this show that are great are to many to list though my favorite has to be the pervy sage Jirya. That is aside from Naruto. I like Garaa a lot as well, it is very hard to have a favorite when there are so many to choose from. I look forward to the next series in this saga."
tt0409591,"Naruto seems to be one of the more popular anime nowadays. And why shouldn't it be? It has an interesting story and a good plot line. The action is exciting, the comedy is great, the characters are likable (except Sakura perhaps), the plot develops quite well and everything is very well performed.But then again, there's also something a lot of anime succumb to. The wonderful world of fillers. Hell, it wouldn't be a big problem either if the fillers weren't the same damn story repeated over and over and over again. It's basically something like this: Naruto and company meet some guy/girl/creature who's different from the others and rejected by the society and Naruto goes 'You're like me'. Beat bad guys up, earn the new guy's trust, become friends, go home and never talk of the incident ever again. From about the 120th episodes to the end of the series there's nothing but this aforementioned nonsense. None of these episodes are nearly as memorable as the one actually related to the plot. Even other anime which are infested with fillers have them 1-2 episode long and they come in between the actual plot related episodes and they do NOT dominate the whole series, unlike Naruto.If they had just made the series about 100 episodes with less(or none at all) fillers, this would've been much better. Lots of potential for a great anime down the drain. If you're looking for an anime with little to no fillers, I highly suggest One Piece.Again, this is an above average anime which had the potential to be amazing but was ruined by the overuse of bland fillers."
tt0409591,"When I first started watching this I had no idea what it was. At first it seemed a little silly and childish but I soon realized the detail that went into the stories, backstories, the world, the ninja way, chakra, their abilities is all fantasically explained in great detail.Once you get past the silly moments (which actually grow on you) the show has some of the best writing I have ever seen. Despite being a cartoon, this show has an excellent storyline and I am currently on Shippuden ep 135 and Shippuden gets even better.The people who do the artwork, the animation have incredible imaginations and bring to life so many things you will never see in any other show.From gengitsu's and all sort of cool jitsu's they bring this show to life in a way that just blows my mind.The way they do the animations is incredible.A top notch show. Top notch writers. I did find that Naruto does have quite a few filler episodes compared to Shippuden. But, it's still quite an enjoyable series.I finally purchased Naruto on DVD many years ago. I would purchase Shippuden but there are so many seasons it's a little too expensive for me at this stage of my life.I highly recommend Naruto and Shippuden. It's one of the best stories I have watched in an anime.I have cheered for him, actually had tears coming down when a certain character passed away in later seasons.The main story in Naruto is top notch. Shippuden has way less fillers - I would say around episode 135 almost no fillers that I can remember. Every episode had something to contribute to character development.I haven't finished watching Shippuden... I really hope the writing stays top notch. I have a feeling it will.I can't wait to go back and watch Naruto once I am done Shippuden. It's been many years since I watched Naruto and now that I have the DVD's from Amazon I am eager to re-watch this wonderful show once I get it into my Plex."
tt0409591,"I would rate this anime a solid 8
if not for the tons of flashbacks
I mean enough already we remember
no need to repeat the same flash back over
its really frustrating"
tt0409591,"This anime is boring and very long.
93 episodes are filler WTF"
tt0409591,"OK, so I've watched 103 episodes so far of this series, and I have to say it, Naruto is original. Yes Mishimoto was a big follower of Toriyama, and in many ways Naruto is a sort of homage to him. But Naruto has a lot of things that DBZ was missing. First off, when characters die, THEY STAY DEAD!!!!! There is no special way to wish them back. Once they're gone they're gone. Second, music: the music in Naruto is 100X better then anything heard in DBZ. Dbz did have some cool themes, but Naruto is the only series where I have actually imported the soundtrack. There's almost nothing wrong with the soundtrack other then the usual soft theme. Granted it isn't a Yoko Kanno piece, but in essence not everything should be compared to the work she does because it invariably falls short. Thirdly, character development:The characters develop feelings for each other, and you will find yourself developing feelings for the characters. There are animes that do that, but not to the extent Naruto does. I have cried multiple times while watching Naruto because of the pain that Naruto and Company have to go through. Mostly Naruto in his quest to become Hokage. In DBZ, I couldn't care less about what happened. Fourth, fights: There is nothing wrong with the length of the fights in Naruto. They're not too fast and they're not too unbearably long. The average fight lasts about 4 episodes. There is an exception to this in the 70s, but only because there are two fights going on at the exact same time. In short, download the first 20 episodes, which takes you through the first saga. Yes, 103 episodes is a lot of time, but the story will keep you engrossed. Also of note, Happy Birthday to the anime which turns 2 years old on Sunday Oct. 3rd. I give this a 9/10"
tt0409591,"I am not a die hard anime fan and i found this series most enjoyable.The characters are well developed and ALL have a reason for doing what they do. After you watch, say, 10 episodes you will start to like them and fell bad when they get hurt, or die(unlike dbz when in a year you can come back to life...).The storyline progresses not too fast, and not too slow providing you with just enough time to swallow what you just heard.As the story progresses the characters all faced with difficult challenges and difficult decisions they have to make. You will not want to wait for the next one. The only bad things are that the English voice acting plainly sucks and there are too many flashbacks."
tt0409591,"Naruto has to be the greatest anime series on the whole world, it has it all comedy, drama and jaw dropping good action fight scenes. the best fight has to be the fight between naruto and sasuke in the valley of the end, the detail put into making that fight alone must have taken weeks. Overall the best anime ever, its worth watching. i used to watch dragon ball z but compared to naruto, its nothing. its slightly disappointing how its has a lot of filler episodes staring from about episode 145 and how much of the story line is flash backs from the characters past. Also the legendary 3 have a fight and thats nothing much compared to most other fights scenes on the series, its supposed to be the ultimate battle against all of the 3 legends of the nartuo world, but the other fights and the main story line makes up for that. the characters are all SO original the most original has to be gaara of the desert, his ninjutsu is the power to use sand, to defened and offend the target, hes got to be my favourite. Orochimaru is a VERY original character alswell, when he first shows up in the story, your not sure if thats really a bad or good guy which makes it even better to watch. After watching an episode you just have to go onto the next one. I got through the whole zabuza saga in one day, I just couldn't stop watching it. you should really consider buying the Japanese version as the American version is not nearly as good."
tt0409591,This anime taught me many lessons rather than my life did.
tt0409591,"This is the first show that put me in the anime world. I first started watching it on jetix, the first 20 episodes of it, which i found to be really interesting. But then it kept repeating them over and over, so i wanted to know what happens next. I went on youtube, and there i started watching the continued episodes (before that copyright policy rule was implemented), on crappy quality, but it was so damned good. I was once home alone, i ordered a pizza, and i watched 31 hours of naruto, with no break, i barely could go to the toilet (who says WoW is the most addictive thing on the internet?). I then discovered better quality episodes on veoh, and later on some different fansub groups like dattebayo which were subbing the show on great quality. Anyway, the point is that the show is very, very, very addictive, no wonder tho, when it has such an epic and genius script. You simply can't predict anything here, you will never be guessing what's coming next, the result will be completely unpredictable, and genius. You will die waiting for the next episode (the 1 minute break between switching the episodes). The soundtracks are, incredible, no matter how tough you think you are, you will have no chance to resist crying. Some of the scenes are so deep, they impress you so much, that you can't help but start crying (i.e. search on youtube for ""sadness and sorrow"" soundtrack, or ""Man of the world"", no matter if you like the anime or not, just search for these 2 soundtracks).So i completed watching all the episodes from Naruto, and went to Naruto shippuuden, where the characters grow up and continue the story. Imo, the shippuuden series are the ones that gave me the impression of this show being epic.The basic story is so long, that i cannot describe it here, way too long. Basiclly, there are 2 friends, the main character naruto, and sasuke. They choose to go on different paths, while naruto keeps thinking of his friend, but sasuke chooses a path of vengeance, to avenge his family who got killed by his older brother, itachi. He seeks power and finally obtains it, and in the end he finds up that his brother actually loved him very much and protected him all his life, that after they have a fight and sasuke wins (wich again, the way the director writes the plot, is so genius, always keeps you shocked).In the end, make sure you watch this show, you will not be disappointed. The first episodes are a bit childish - but this anime is certainly not for kids, later you will see why - but the plot is so incredibly good that it will keep you watching and watching it, i guarantee that !10/10 from me, i would rate more if possible."
tt0409591,"I won't spoil much, just some general stuff.Naruto, popular anime series, started of with a blast (at least in my eyes) with variety of well characterized characters and intriguing story in ninja world and on top of all it is very addicting. If I had to compare this anime series to another one I would pick Dragonball. Although all of this positive stuff, Naruto began to to lose it's charm as more and more episodes flew by. The most disappointing part of Naruto are the fillers that are pretty bad, unnecessary and just ruining the show. Don't get me wrong, they are emotional and all, but they are just slowing and stalling the show. I only hope that this will change in future and that things will start to look up, cause this could end up like another Dragonball, which started great but later became awful.Objectively, from this point, I would give it a 5-6 stars, but I can't do that due to the emotional attachment to it's characters and world. So this grade is some mix of subjective and objective experience.I'll cross my fingers for this show and you should go watch and see it for yourself."
tt0409591,"If you, like me, are going to start watching this anime for the first time and you are also in your 20s, I definitely do not recommend it. Both the first season and the hurricane chronicles are designed for a children's audience. The high score is solely on the nostalgic feelings of former children. The slow speed of storytelling and the incredible amount of fillers made watching 720 episodes a torture. Think twice."
tt0409591,"To see people say this is the ''Best anime ever'' is BEYOND laughable. I must admit at first I was intrigued. I as SO HOOKED. I couldn't stop watching, it was amazing. But then it got old, boring, and PREDICTABLE. I mean Naruto always wins. If you see a villain fight him or a main character you KNOW and I mean KNOW that character is going to be defeated or killed off. It was frustrating. I stopped watching around episode 110 or so? I mean I think the show still goes on or something shippuden which is ridiculous. They are going to keep destroying this show. Honestly it's an alright show with an amazing start but dragged out."
tt2216156,"After the first four episodes and I am gob-smacked. It has been a long time since I have been so excited by a BBC drama & so refreshing to have it set in the present. No costumes, and no history lessons needed to be able to appreciate the emotions coursing through the characters as they cope with the manic plot twists. I say manic, but they remain believable nonetheless as plausible drama's we could all have happen in our lives. More surprising is that the rate of storytelling. Every second and every facial expression is made to count, but this never intrudes on the - real life time feel of the piece. If I have made Last Tango in Halifax sound mundane- it is not it is bonkers. For me the 'what on earth is going to happen next' factor is the biggest draw. But each scene on its own is already a mini stand alone story. If that is down to the quality of the acting the scene play or the production I cannot say. Last Tango is utterly absorbing and I cannot wait for more. (vote 9 in stead of 10 because of the spoiling spoilers at the end of the episode)"
tt2216156,"This is one of the series i liked the most. It is profound, comprehensive, extraordinary, unpredictable and the acting is super. The variation in the character cast is magnificent . The authentic roll play sublime. It is one of the examples why I highly admire the British series. It could be well a real life example of ordinary people with all their usual daily problems and emotions. Nicola is my best favorite actress, I have seen her in River too. But nothing less to all the other actors without exception they are all of a very high class.I (me Dutch) have learned a lot from the slang that used in the series. Although English subtitles are highly appreciated for me. I can't wait for the next series to come out."
tt2216156,"We know these people. They're intelligent, charming, fallible and not always predictable. Three-dimensional characters, with sometimes untidy lives. We see their bad behavior, unreasonable bias, decency and moments of brilliance as they navigate the ups and downs. There's a not unkind truthfulness to the way their stories are told. The writing is extraordinary. The sets, the costumes, the editing - clearly a team of pros brought this together. And there's the dialect - articles are rarely used, and there's plenty of ""owt"", ""nowt"", ""summat"", ""dozy"", and ""appen"". It's all brought to life by top-notch actors, some familiar, others new, but all well cast.On the whole, outstanding work, which is what makes this series so wonderful and believable."
tt2216156,"Sally Wainwright does it again!! What a brilliant writer she is. Just look at the stuff she has written... all of it so clever, so entertaining, so observant. The characters, their awkward situations, their messed up lives are all so believable. I understand why some say the story-lines appear farcical but that is part of the fun, watching people of vastly different backgrounds interact and deal with their often self induced problems. Didn't have the time to watch the original transmission, so bought the DVD of series one and so glad I did. I watched all six episodes over two nights followed by series two over the next two nights.What a fabulous cast, fabulous direction and beautiful photography....what more can I say? What I will add, cautiously, is that series three may(?) be a series to many. I sincerely hope not! Thanks Sally, you are a genius."
tt2216156,"The first episode itself captivates you as soon as the lead protagonists meet for the first time after over 60 years. Very rarely do you see such insightful and delightful stories involving septuagenarians. It has both its thrilling and heartwarming moments, right from the beginning. It has a lot of heart, and the first episode itself draws me into their lives; it was the same way I felt about Downton Abbey. And as Downton, it has a mesmerizing and entrancing opening score which sets the appropriate and stirring mood for the episodes.The things people wonder about, remain angry or sad about, imagining the reason behind certain events... all those things are treated quite beautifully in the series. Over the episodes, the lead couple and close kin go through many ups and downs, much like normal life. The supporting characters, mainly the close kin of the lead couple, form quite intriguing and fascinating characters. The way our lives and actions affect the people close to us, and vice-versa, is shown masterfully in this season. I liked how they handled the realization of Caroline's new exploration of sexuality (in her middle ages, after her divorce), and how her family reacts to it.The acting by the entire cast, especially the 70-something leads, Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid, and Sarah Lancashire, is top notch. The screenplay and editing is brilliant, the appropriate timings of events and reactions draws you into the lives of these intriguing characters.Quite an unusual and delightful romantic drama."
tt2216156,"""Last Tango in Halifax"" (2012) is a BBC miniseries that will have run for four seasons. Each episode is about an hour long. I'm reviewing the first six episodes--the entire first season. The series is written by Sally Wainwright. Different episodes have different directors.The key plot point is that Celia (Anne Reid) and Alan (Derek Jacobi) were in love with the other as teenagers. For complicated reasons they were parted, and lived separate lives for 60 years. They are reunited via Facebook, and they fall back in love. (All this is seen in the first 20 minutes of the first episode, so I'm not giving anything away.)Each has raised a daughter. Alan's daughter Gillian (Nicola Walker) and Celia's daughter Caroline (Sarah Lancashire) have gone down very different paths. Gillian is a widow. Caroline is in an estranged relationship with her husband John (Tony Gardner).I've already named five characters, but there are more. What's amazing is that the actors portraying each character are all truly excellent. There's not a weak link among them. The BBC has the unique ability to find great actors, and to enable them to work together seamlessly.Derek Jacobi is a famous Shakespearean actor, so we expect great things from him. However, the other actors keep pace with him. If I had to single one of them out, it would be Tony Gardner, as Caroline's husband, John. John is a cheat and an opportunist, but, when he's on screen, he dominates the scene with his very believable and often successful opportunism.This miniseries was produced for TV, so, of course, it works well on the small screen. If you missed it in 2012, you owe it to yourself to see it now. It's melodramatic, but that's what makes it interesting. Some reviewers have called it a BBC soap opera, but I don't agree. It has the look and feel of a first-rate movie, the production values are high, and the acting is superb. If you don't like it, you can always stop watching after the first episode. Trust me--you'll choose to see all six episodes, and then you'll order Season Two and Season Three."
tt2216156,"Thank you Netflix, for introducing us to the work of Sally Wainwright (and to actors like Sarah Lancashire!). This has to be one of the sweetest, nicest, most absorbing series I have seen in years - so much better than the usual run of the mill North American stuff. It takes its time to introduce you to the lives and thoughts of its cast, and in doing so, it captures you completely. You fall in love with haughty Caroline and mixed up, do anything for love Gillian. Even the less sympathetic characters - John and Judith - are fun to be with as you wait to see them plunge into their next disaster. As for the two lovebirds, Alan and Celia, they are just so believable and such a delight to spend time with. After watching this, I've discovered Scott & Bailey, also by Sally Wainwright and can't believe the same person wrote such two very different series. I've also watched Happy Valley with Sarah Lancashire and she is incredible. The contrast with her character in Last Tango is stunning. So once again, thank you Netflix. Thank you Sally Wainwright!"
tt2216156,"I love this show, but honestly I don't know why Alan is so smitten with Celia. She is such a b***h! Totally self-centered!!!"
tt2216156,"Though I can't decide if Celia's character (not Anne Reid who plays her) adds or detracts from the series. The acting is first rate.I got increasingly angry and annoyed with her small minded, almost narcissistic behavior at times.The creator/writer, Sally Wainwright, always did her best to redeem her. If anything, Celia is the villain.Having said that, anything Wainwright develops turns to TV gold. She is a master at nuance, and small talk. Her characters so true to real life.Ten stars from me. (Because every dynamic show needs a Gillian)"
tt2216156,"The one reviewer was absolutely right when they said that the second season devolved into farce. We loved, loved the first season and were watching two or three episodes of an evening. Now it is really hard to get through just one, like an unpalatable chore. We are going to hang in there and hope things right themselves. Either that or fast forward to the end. In the first season I enjoyed Celia and Alan sitting, chatting and chewing on a 'sweet' but now I find it quite annoying. I also found Alan's reactions to Gillian's 'hurt' rather harsh and over the top. I really feel for her and know she is the author of her own fate but still... My husband and I just felt the creators/directors were overloading the show to no useful purpose. Does not one think that the fears and foibles of 'disappointing human beings' are enough to carry us along? I would have thought so. I had given the first season a 10 but so far, into the second, a 6 and not being harsh. Most series do not start devolving until the 4th or 5th (even Downton is getting redundant and a bit trashy) but this - and we don't know why - went from fantastic to farce in the space of no time at all!"
tt2216156,"First. I love BBC dramas because, as opposed to US shows, they use actual actors who can actually act. We turned this on just to watch Derek Jacobi. He, and the others do not disappoint.
That said, this is an infuriating soap opera. Every character seems to have a congenital inability to think before they speak. And they are all on a hair trigger to believe the worst about every other character in this loving family dramedy.
We created a drinking game that whenever a character says something like, ""I've never told anybody this before,"" or ""sit down I need to share something,"" we bet on how long its will be before they share that confidential tidbit with the one person who will take it in the worst possible way.
You want to like the characters, but they are all dozy pillocks."
tt2216156,"I didn't watch the first series on TV, but happened across it on DVD rentals, and became enthralled and enslaved. I really enjoy the leading couple, and their 'daughters' , my how Raquel has grown up! Some of the story lines are a bit far-fetched, and I can't help thinking that perhaps Gillian would have benefited from a stronger chastisement occasionally when she was younger and hormonal, but they are what they are. I love that she is always up to her armpits in dung when she gets company or a phone call - I hope they pay her enough. I hope it doesn't get too silly, but some families do lurch from crisis to disaster, so if they can balance the humour, then it will be realistic. The production team have done a grand job, the acting is splendid. Love it."
tt2216156,"This series is one of the best television shows I have ever seen. It hits a lot of hot buttons with its fantasy romance between the two stars, and a variety of sub-plots involving failed marriages, same sex love, alcohol, rivalry, lust, anger, etc. We see bonding that bridges the generations, and distrusts that become solid friendships. Ordinary people from across the social spectrum interact in the two families of Celia (Anne Reid) and Alan (Derek Jacobi). The characters (other than Alan and Celia) can find themselves alternately partying or warring with each other, sometimes in humorous ways. It is the perfect soap opera but beyond that, the first two seasons of this outstanding series show the viewer the range of human behaviour, even within the same characters. The two leads, played by Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi, find one another sixty years after adolescence. Their embryonic relationship never reached fruition in their youth. Six decades later, it suddenly blossomed, much to their total surprise and delight. What followed is a complicated story that draws us into the lives of their family and extended relationships. I found the series very rewarding and addictive as I looked forward to each episode."
tt2216156,I accidentally started recording Season 3 on PBS and immediately fell in love with this series. I'm not surprised it won so many BAFTAs and was enjoyed by people of all ages. It's so well acted and the srtoylines are so believable. The characters are flawed yet we sympathize with all of them. I immediately purchased Season 1 & 2
tt2216156,"This is an outstanding and beautifully acted contemporary, middle class family drama. The character development is supurb. I felt I could relate to many of the characters and the delimas facing them in their everyday lives.
The backdrop is Yorkshire with it's wild, fantastic scenery."
tt2216156,"This show is so entertaining. The dialogue, the relationships, the love the older couple (who I adored) share after being apart for so many years were all so satisfying that I felt good after watching each episode. There is some drama to keep you on your toes, but everyone always comes together in the end to find a solution. The acting was superb."
tt2216156,Stellar cast including the almost incomparable Sarah Lancashire. Beautiful rugged setting that makes you yearn for the English countryside. Storylines become a little far fetched as the series goes on and it should have maybe been wrapped up in two seasons.
tt2216156,"It was super adorable for the first season, and you'll be charmed beyond your wildest dreams. Adore the first part because it truly is delightful, and I mean in a big way, and then get the heck out. Because after that, the writers apparently forget to take their Zoloft. After Grandma and Grandpa get married, ditch this train wreck unless you love bathing in British passive-aggressive exercises in self-pity and co-dependence, that is.
It becomes a horn-rimmed, bejeweled crap stew in which everyone is now irritating. You find that having to stop yourself from shouting to your TV, ""WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!?!"" is a common occurrence.
You'll want to punch everyone, particularly Grandma. Sweet mother of crap, that sounds awful I know, but if that woman had to live in my house, I'd be looking for a high place from which to jump."
tt2216156,Wonderful cast of characters funny together with oh so much drama. Never a dull moment with something new always popping up. Character development among the main players is steady and sure with plenty of twists and turns along the way.
tt2216156,"This show left me wanting more. As with several British series I have watched over the years, they always leave their viewers caring about their characters and wanting more.Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid were splendid in their characters of Alan and Celia. The entire cast ensemble was fantastic.There is a great talent with British screenwriters when it comes to character development. They present actors who look like real people, not the Hollywood stereotype of perfection. British actors have flawed complexions, bad haircuts, and imperfect teeth. In other words, they look like real people.Their scripts tell a story without what Hollywood thinks is a need for car chases, explosions, gratuitous nudity. They tell a story that makes the viewer care about the characters and wonder what happens to them when the scene ends.Americans are left at the mercy of the BBC, Acorn and other production entities that give us snippets of shows and then leave us dangling. Then there are actors who develop a cult following but then simply become tired of playing a certain character and move on to other roles. All I can do as an American viewer of British television shows is appreciate the talent of all those involved in the creative process."
tt3006802,"Outlander was so much better than I expected it to be. It's much more than just another love story. I just got caught up through the latest season and floored by how much I enjoyed it. It is so well written and acted that you really come to care for these characters and what happens to them. It's also beautifully shot, everything from the cinematography to the costumes are excellent. The overall production value on this s as good as anything on tv. I do have to say the the last few seasons weren't quite as good as the earlier ones but they're still worth watching. If you haven't seen this yet then do yourself a favor and go watch as soon as possible!"
tt3006802,"I never read the Outlander books so I didn't really know what to expect. I originally thought it was a show targeted just for women but I was way wrong. This show has something for everyone and I'm so glad I finally gave it a chance because it's become one of my favorite shows! I binged the entire series and absolutely loved it! The only negative thing I have to say about it is that Season 6 was really not that good, and that's coming from a fan. I pretty much had to force myself to watch it and even found myself fast forwarding through some episodes."

tt3006802,"Came late to Outlander and binge watched it. A beloved friend who recently died of cancer, too young, told me to watch it, so I did in her honour. So glad! It has everything! The casting is perfect with stellar performances of gritty storylines. The locations, romance, STUNNING memorable music, scenery, costumes and props, and attention to historical detail, have all left quite an impression on me. In my opinion this is much more than just a Harlequin romance, and deserves more kudos."
tt3006802,What am I to do. Now that I know this exists. I'm not sure I will find my own way back to my life.
tt3006802,"For the past 23 years, Outlander has been a presence in my life. Have read it countless times, in fact started it again just yesterday. I am proud and humbled to be One of the Original Seven Ladies of Lallybroch, associated with one of the very first global groups devoted to Diana Gabaldon and The Books. For decades, the idea of a cinematic version of The Books has teased and taunted us, flirting with our imaginations and hopes. Now, it is here. And here it is. Every detail is brilliant - script, costumes, sets, and yes, the actors. The Series is a visual companion to The Books, and a boon companion it is. It is also an adaptation, not a verbatim recitation. Fidelity to our beloved characters and story is assured by the continuing involvement of Diana in the creative process. She fiercely protects her story and, in the process, her fans - which are both legion and legend. Caitriona Balfe truly IS Claire, as Sam Heughan IS Jamie. A cup up to Ron Moore, Maril Davis, and the entire crew (Terry for the amazing costumes)for giving us Our Outlander..."
tt3006802,"There are only a few movies and series I have watched more then once in my life.
But Outlander takes the cake, I think I watched the whole series like 4 times now! I don't know what it is, but it keeps me hooked!
Can't wait for the next season to air!
I have never been a real die hard fan of much in my life, but in this case I am!"
tt3006802,"I never read the books and never heard anything about this story before I saw the show. I don't know how close it comes to the books but as a show is absolutely fantastic.Everything was done right , actors , costumes, music and the scotsmen in kilts are so sexy . I am in love.We have beautiful landscapes , music to match , time travel , an intelligent mature woman as a lead character and two attractive men that love her . I like the romance part and the history part. I like everything about this show.I wish they add some subtitles . I don't know how well native English speakers understand the Gaelic but English is not my native language and I could not understand a word in Gaelic."
tt3006802,"The first two seasons were amazing. I could not take my eyes of the screen.The music, the set, the characters were perfect.However, it took a huge nosedive after season 3 and became really boring.Brianna and Rodger are really annoying and Brianna especially is hard to watch sometimes.It's really disappointing because it was such an amazing show. I did watch season 4 and still me of season 5 but it just became apparent that it was never going to get its magic back. So I've quit the show.Not sure if it is the same story as the book but I did but the books and think I'm going to read those instead."
tt3006802,"Had heard nothing but good things about 'Outlander' from good friends and trusted reviewers around the time Seasons 1-3 (widely considered the period where 'Outlander' was at its best) aired, but due to music commitments and watching other things it did take me a while to get round to watching the show. Absolutely loved the idea of the show, which has always been one of my main reasons for watching anything, and loved the idea of the mix of period drama and time travel.'Outlander', after finally getting around to watching it a while back, was on the whole hugely impressive. It is agreed that Seasons 1-3 are fantastic, and while over deliberate pacing and bizarreness crept in in Season 4 there was a lot to like about that season too. Do agree with those that were disappointed with Seasons 5-6 and those that felt like watching two different shows, especially 6 which repeated all the mistakes Season 5 did, amplified them and made more along the way.There are a lot of fantastic things. It is wonderful visually, with handsome and evocative settings and costumes that do such a wonderful job transporting one to the time period and making them feel that they are there. Even better is the photography, which is at its best cinematic worthy. Not only is it beautiful to watch, but it is very rich in atmosphere. Likewise with the music scoring, which never felt too much in placement or volume while still having a lot of presence and variety (hardly stock cue level here).A vast majority of the direction is accommodating and allows the drama to breathe, when necessary in the more scaled down scenes, while also giving plenty of tension and energetic momentum in the more tense moments. Seasons 1-3 are very thoughtfully written and full of complex emotions, while the storytelling in these moments grabs the attention, never feels predictable or soap-ridden and has plenty of tension, intrigue and emotion. 'Outlander' is an extremely well acted show too, with everybody cast to pretty much perfection and that is including when the show declined.Season 4 still has plenty of those things, though some of it feels more dragged out and some parts are a bit too on the silly to the point of bizarreness. That is nothing compared to Seasons 5 and 6, particularly as said 6, which often has slow as molasses pacing (over-deliberation taken to extremes), paper thin storytelling that is at worst uneventful and subplots that are very melodramatic and take a long time to get anywhere in development.Furthermore, the writing in Seasons 5 and 6 underwhelms a lot, one can literally taste the flavourless soap suds listening to the dialogue, which is stilted too and induces a lot of cringing. The characters are stripped of their complexity also and become rather one dimensional. Thank goodness the exceptionally high quality of the production values, music and acting remain, which saves them from unwatchability.In summation, started off fantastic but the past two seasons have felt like a different show quality-wise. 7/10 (Seasons 1-3 would rate around 8-10, Season 4 would rate 6-low 8 and Seasons 5 and 6 are a 4 at best)"
tt3006802,"I've recently been reading (actually listening to the audio-books) the Outlander series of books having completed 5 so far so when I saw the Starz TV series was coming out I just had to watch it. I must say I loved the Outlander books, but I'm not a fanatic when it comes to translating books to the screen they are very different mediums and thus can take on a different look and feel and that's OK with me. In this case, I don't think people who are would be disappointed anyway as the screen writers did an excellent job of translating the 1st part of the book to the screen (I've only seen the 1st episode but I'm already hooked so I'm sure I'll enjoy the rest). I loved their choice of actors to take on the roles of Jamie, Claire, Frank and Dugan. Sam Heughan is perfect as Jamie Fraser (just the right bit of good looks and ruggedness one might expect in Jamie). Caitriona Balfe also seemed like a good choice for Claire (beautiful yet strong enough to carry the role). I think Frank/Jack Randall's portrayal by Tobias Menzies will also fit my vision of Frank/Jack and I think he can carry off both roles one as the wicked Jack and the other as the loving yet dull Frank (when compared to Jamie). And the Scottish actors like Graham McTavish (Dougal) will bring old Scotland to life on the screen for me. From the 1st episode I think they producers will not be shy to include the more sexual aspects of the Outlander books, as they do have this erotic element that actually makes the love between Claire and Jamie the driving force of their relationship which allows it to span centuries, even when they are no longer together. It's that love/passion for each other that keeps them alive in each other's heart and so far to the directors credit, they have not been shy about adding it. I'm looking forward to the Claire Jamie love scenes hopefully to come... I'm also going to enjoy the Scottish history and scenery, and loved the way they so far have included it in the TV series. It's going to be very interesting to me especially as my ancestors are Scottish.I know Starz will be increasing its revenues with this series' fans all signing up just to see it. There must be millions of us around the world that love these books and I'm sure like me many of them will order the cable channel just to watch this. I'm very happy to see Starz did such a good job in bringing this to life on the screen. So rarely do we get a good adult drama on TV these days, and this will surely be that. I'm liking many of the original show Starz is offering this season like this and Black Sails, Strikback. Who ever is heading their creative development deserves a lot of credit for their selection of shows to produce. I think Starz is catching up to HBO and Showtime in it's original shows and might even surpass them if it keeps producing shows of this quality plus they have a much better selection of movies that the other channels. As a new Starz member, I'd recommend it to others."
tt3006802,"A fabulous period drama with a compelling premise along with the usual historical trimmings - beautiful costumes, authentic dialogue, delightful settings ... With a strength-in-depth casting including an especially fine performance from Caitríona Balfe as the time challenged Claire, this is a winning format.Seasons one to three are superb, season four became tedious, drawn out and lacked credibility even in the stretched context of the story. Subsequently it has become a sluggish soap opera, detached from its intriguing core-concept.Top television, past its best, betrayed its legacy and in need of humane euthanization."
tt3006802,"I have been a fan, make that obsessed fan, from the first book. There are now eight BIG books in the series along with The Lord John series and a few novellas. I've read them all numerous times. I was hesitant about TV show ruining the books but Starz and Ron D. Moore have shown that you can use a book's dialog and make the actors fit into the characters and make a marvelous show.Outlander so far has been a perfect representation of the book. Sam Heughan as Jamie is sublime.....as is Caitrona Balfe as Claire. Even though Claire is telling the story, it's Jamie we all want. I am thrilled with the camera work, the costumes, and the writing. I'm thinking subtitles for the Gaelic Language would have been a good decision but I understand why there is none. After all Claire doesn't understand it either and it is her story.Kudos to Diana Gsbaldon for writing the stories and for trusting Ron D. Moore with it. Watch!,"
tt3006802,"I'm late to discover this series, and managed to binge it all to Season 7A in a month. The first 2 seasons feel like a completely different show, it keeps me glued and craving just one more episode. But my God the beginning of Season 3 was a chore. I know many don't like Richard but man, I love him as Roger, he just brings a realism to the character for me. Sophie however comes across as an acting student trying too hard to play a spoilt child. Her scenes are downright painful to watch and there is 0 chemistry between her and Richard, and man who's idea was that terrible accent? Really the wrong actress for the part."
tt3006802,"I've really enjoyed this series. One of the best shows available on Netflix and other sources.This show has not become as mainstream as I would like, and I pray it maintains enough popularity to remain in production.If you enjoy historical TV shows that are spiced with the right concoction of romance, plot and action, then this is the right show for you."
tt3006802,"There's nothing to dislike about this tv show. I like it all. The costumes, the acting, the actors, the make up, the music, the atmosphere, the plot! The show really takes you back in time and makes you forget of your daily struggles. It also shows very accurately how hard the life was at that time, forcing you to appreciate everything you have today. The characters are complex and they evolve beautifully each season. I couldn't believe that i will become addicted to this show, it gets better and better with each season, fact which doesn't happen normally with other shows. It's an amazing show."
tt3006802,I loved the first two seasons and the 3rd season was still fine. But all started going downhill in 4th and 5th seasons.Not gonna lie but I feel like Sophie Skelton was not meant to play Brianna. Same with Richard rankin. They didn't feel like the characters. Instead I actually felt like they were trying to become the characters but failed miserably.There were timeS when everyone did quite a performance in this series but I felt like in was lacking in these two. Especially Sophie Skelton (Brianna).I love Lauren Lyle and her acting is immaculate. I feel like she's under appreciated. She needs more hype. Marsali is such a badass.
tt3006802,"Everything about EP1 is wonderful. I'm a fan of the book series and I'm happy that Ron D. Moore is at the helm of this project. I think the casting of the lead roles is perfect. The locations and sets evoke each of the time periods portrayed. The music is amazing; it adds character to the events as they unfold and I'm looking forward to hearing more in later episodes. There is some criticism about the pace of EP1, I agree that it felt a bit slow. Viewers who feel it's too slow, please note that the book is about 800 pages long! Additionally, Starz bought 16 EPs rather than the usual 10, so that RDM has time to develop the story line and the many characters that appear in the book. The voice over takes some getting used to, since it's not a common practice today. So I refer back to the book again, because the reader is let into the lead character's thoughts most of the time - it's not all dialogue. You don't have to read the book to enjoy the show and I believe new viewers who give it a chance over the next several EPs as the action in the story picks up won't be disappointed and will appreciate what all the fan fuss is about."
tt3006802,"First three series were riveting, fourth you could still watch but the 5 is like watching paint dry. Far, far too slow and with the time travel not part of it the magic seems to have gone out of it. Too much about Claire and her daft daughter and less history as it progressed. Hope this is the last series they just about killed it off anyway."
tt3006802,"I never seen such an amazing TV Show, that include the adrenaline, the action, love, power, old times, healings and other interesting things, all in the same time.
Outlander just make me love the old times, and make me want more.
Every episode is interesting, because they add always something new. You can't even get bored.
The actors gives the best and makes you fall in love and live the story for real.
Every chapter have something different that you don't expect and they will surprise you in a good way.
I recommend all the 5 seasons, and can't wait for the season 6 or maybe more too.
Love it, love it, love it.
Congratulations to the all actors and to the all equipe that make part of this amazing project!"
tt3006802,"The actress who plays Brianna is terrible. She ruined this show. Couldn't they afford to hire a better person? She's totally wooden. Especially unfortunate because the other actors are terrific. I'll finish season four but won't be watching subsequent seasons. Special shoutout to the actor who plays Murtagh-he's amazing. And another shoutout to the wardrobe department-Claire's clothes are gorgeous. Even though his character was reprehensible, Tobias Menzies was fantastic in the show. The chemistry between Catriona and Sam is electric-totally understandable that she'd give up indoor plumbing for that man!"
tt3006802,"I enjoyed this show very much, part 1 was terrific: beautiful landscapes and costumes, humour and very good acting. Part 2 and 3 were nice, but then it became pretty ridiculous. But I kept watching, because it remained quite entertaining. But season 6! It is terrible, can't watch it. The characters have become more and more one dimensional. Jamie's face always has a big frown, his posture seems frozen and Claire can only look worried and serious with big watery eyes. No laughing, no humour and a lot of new and uninteresting characters. Outlander has become something between Little House on the Prairie and Dr Quinn Medicine Woman. It is painful how such an outstanding show has become a cringing soap :-("
tt3006802,"Having discovered Gabalton's novels only recently (generally reserving my limited reading time to the likes of Bernard Cornwell and Patrick O'Brien, more swords;less romance),I was pleased with the quality of the production, casting, pace and overall presentation of this complex story. Romantic? Yes. However, if the mini-series story line continues in keeping with the books (as seems likely)it will likely unfold into dovetailing themes of sacrifice,duty,honor,jealousies and complex loyalties that even many of the male viewers will relate wholeheartedly to. Not since PeterJackson's close to the novel(s) rendition of the Lord of the Rings saga have I been as pleased (at least with the initial installment) with a book-to-screen version of a great story. Thanks STARZ!"
tt3006802,"Everything from the cast to the costumes to the locations. This show is perfect!! Every episode is its own adventure!! I started out as a show watcher, now I am an avid book reader!! I can't believe it took so long to make this into a tv show. It just has everything!! Time travel, drama, romance, and some some historical value!! It was great to see that Sam Heughan is actually a producer of seasons 5 and 6. I hope they all stick with it to the very end! The cast is so unbelievable! Being from the US, I didn't know all of the actors at first, but they are brilliant!! I just can't say enough of this wonderful show. Absolutely well done!"
tt10384610,"I will be honest, I saw the trailer for this on Netflix and added it to my list because it looked interesting and goofy enough to waste at least 15 minutes on an episode, without giving it much thought. It stayed in my list for a couple of months until I finally got around to it. And I'm really happy I did.
At first i went into it more as background noise, it wouldn't be the first show that i had in the background, just so the room isn't silent while I'm doing something else. Initially had it set on english, so I didn't have to pay much attention to the screen, while still hearing what's going on. But in the middle of the 3rd episode I realised that I was actually paying more attention to the show than I initially wanted to, and the story started to suck me in.
The characters show up one by one, not crowding the episode, and they each get an explanation on who they are and why they do what they do but not necessarily from the start (you will get some heartwarming backstory on a few of the characters in the OVAs and episodes in season 2). The show is mainly a comical one, with splapstick gags employed throughout each episode, but with a dramatic tone that makes itself felt especially in the backstory episodes or in the main storyline.
Overall, the show is great, with very good character building, even if the style of animation might be off-putting for some."
tt10384610,Innovative little show with a passion for animation.
tt10384610,"Full of imagination, comedy, very good action scenes, dramatic and charm...It's one of the best anime of Netflix and the world.It's a very rare anime on this ""anime era"" that has a lot of garbage and ridiculous animes.Scissor seven (killer seven), little witch academia, and Lewis are the best animes from Netflix until now."
tt10384610,"This show has some of the best action and humor in an anime Netflix Show, hands down recommend this."
tt10384610,"It's quirky but well done. Good animation style, interesting writing, decent directing. Overall it's a good show worth watching. Good change of pace from typical anime which is badly needed."
tt10384610,"Witty and ridiculous as hell!
Episode two killed me! LOL"
tt10384610,"I absolutely adored this series. I was blown away by hand drawn animations in this day and age. The characters were so movable and had so much life. The team even added a swaggle in one episode to brag about their animating skills. It's also stylistic so it'll age very well.On top of that, the humor was original. It also had its serious moments, which were dramatic as well. The extremities of the situation and the centering of the scenes really brought out how important some parts were.I honestly did not expect to see a work of art like this in the form of an adult animation. It's so unique!"
tt10384610,"Full of colours and great animation!
This my first Chinese Anime and I'm not disappointed. The show is light hearted and funny but at the same time action packed. The fight scenes are made exciting with the colourful and vibrant animation. And when the storyline becomes serious you can still bare to watch it without feeling like the whole idea has changed. The plot and characters are unique and I'd suggest you watch it in mandarin."
tt10384610,"Its a greeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeat Anime. Not just: nice, i like it.
Its really great. Its really playing with our expetations sometimes scissor just is beating people up(not very common) or it looks so but someone unexpected happens that is hilarious and everyone happy. The Story is somtimes very dark but only do make it hilarious in the next 2 minutes. I laughed very much one of the best Netflix Original Anime ever made and I hope a third Season will come"
tt10384610,"It starts out as mostly a comedy, about a goofy, clumsy hairdresser who wishes he was a lihai kungfu assassin. His sidekicks are funny. His love interest is a secretive and powerful assassin herself. The plot is witty and unique.Some episodes are pure drama. Some are mostly kungfu action, albeit lighthearted. Some are a bit artistic and abstract. Most are comedy.It continues that way for two seasons. But then, in the third season, it starts to drift more into the kungfu action. Drama remains here and there. Comedy starts becoming rarer and rarer.And by the fourth season, it feels like a completely different show. Episodes 1 and 2, for example, are each a single kungfu battle, both over-the-top yet taking itself seriously. It feels like a group of teenage animators took control and are just trying to one-up each other with 'here comes a really unstoppable ability' after another after another after another.And where's Ronnie in all that?! :(If it ever gets back to its season 1-2 roots, it'll be a must-see again!"
tt10384610,The growth... Phenomenal! The humor.... Stellar! The art... INCOMPARABLE! this was and is the best Chinese cartoon I have ever seen in my entire life. Probably one of the best cartoons in general honestly. I will watch it probably 2 more times until the next season comes out. I was LITERALLY gasping and laughing out loud and I could not stop myself. Please WATCH IT FOR YOUR OWN GOOD
tt10384610,"An anime with commonplace characterization and background settings stands out from the others for being lifelike in terms of plot. It combines a thrilling plot with the everyday life of the protagonists, creating a strong and captivating sense of contrast and conflict. Heavily influenced by Stephen Chow's comedic style, the show is vaguely reminiscent of the martial arts works of Jin Yong and Gu Long. The producers tend to create an interpretation of ""chivalry in modern society""."
tt10384610,"This is the best Anime in my opinion. Even though i'm a massive weeb, i can't get into Anime. I Always feel like the Art and Style of the Manga ist better. Not in this Case. Goddamn, i love the artstyle. And the Humor. And the Characters. Check it Out."
tt10384610,"I've been watching since season 1 and i can say that after watching over 150+ top rated animes this beautiful chinese anime stole my heart. Its a total masterpiece, from a beautifully written story to Its heartwarming soundtrack and very unique perfect art style. This anime made me cry multiple times because of its wonderful writting and perfectly synced soundtrack. The characters also grows into you and they become a part of you. This anime is truly a hidden gem and I really am surprised how many people doesnt even know about it. Many people may not want to watch it because of the stereotypes that chinese animes are always bad, but this anime really proved it wrong. I really hope to see more people watching this anime in the future and if the person reading this hasnt watched it yet. Watch it. You wont regret it. The only downside to this anime is that you'll have a hard time finding an anime that would cause the same emotions and feelings felt while watching this anime. Really big thanks to the people working on this anime, I love you all."
tt10384610,"9 for humor ,if u love/enjoy stephen Chows flick u will def like this. Mo lei tau(HK slapstick style)5 for animation style (i gave this a 5 due to rough feel but excellent action scene prolly a 7)Characters (definitely likeable) Mc is a a 'laid back but talented' stereotype.thanks for Netflix for taking in this series i(it showed up in the trending section or otherwise i wouldnt even bother watching it."
tt10384610,"Really wanted to get my opinion out there since MAL doesn't have this show up as a review option on their site.First off, let me just say that scissor seven has officially solidified itself as my favorite slice of life anime at the moment, and completely exceeded my initial expectations going into the show.The pacing is amazing for a 13 min. show, and the comedic timing just splendid. It packs a colorful plot line each and every episode with such tight time constraints.The animation is a work of passion and the art-style distinct and works really well with the overall tone and feel of the story. It carves out its own identity while also paying homage to its Japanese predecessor (Jojo's reference everywhere).The story, while not terrible , isn't exactly the most ground breaking of plot lines. It's pretty straightforward : misadventures of an amnesiac assassin and his sunglasses totting blue chicken side-kick. But what's amazing is how the show doesn't take itself too seriously. Because of the flexible , laid back nature of the show, it allows itself to dive into an almost innumerable array of backdrops and truly makes for a unique, almost anthology- like, experience each and every episode.Overall, if you want a truly unique viewing experience and love to be surprised, treat yourself to some plain old slapstick comedy that is scissor seven.Ps. If you're a non- Chinese speaking viewer, switch it to English dub. Without a doubt one of the best decisions of my life. :) ciao"
tt10384610,"I enjoy Anime and animated series/movies - when they are good. Delightedly, this is one of them.The premise is interesting, the characters are nicely defined and ultimately very fascinating, and the story quite gripping and fresh.The music used is also quite incredible and really helps to draw you into the world."
tt10384610,"Japanese Anime is obviously extremely popular but China has officially made my favorite show!! This is an absolute gem, the phenomenal storyline takes some time to get going but eventually becomes extremely gripping. The music in this show is soo good and the comedy is well thought out and even made me literally LOL at times, awesome job China this is just an overall winner of a show."
tt10384610,"I started watching it because of the good reviews. I almost turned it off after a couple of episodes but I decided to keep going and I am very happy that I did! It is funny, good story line, great characters and now I am left wanting more! Where is season 3?!? 😁"
tt10384610,"I havent enjoyed a tv show like i enjoyed Scissor severnIts a master piece in every bit , from the creative start till the end song.The show gets even better is season 2 with more action and comedy.I highly recommend this series and cant wait for a season 3 !"
tt10384610,"This is not bad at all if you are ok with the Chinese VAs and traditional animation. Stylish action scenes, good character development and nice mixture of comedy. Definitely recommended."
tt10384610,This show is so funny and the animation is amazing. I hope more of this gets made! We want more!
tt10384610,"Been looking for a new cartoon to watch late night now that I've binged my way through almost every subscription I own, and came across Scissors Seven. Started watching the English dub, not expecting too much, and was pleasantly surprised. At first I thought I was just watching a stereotypical teenage-edgy but fun for all cartoon, but it's so. much. more! Almost Speed Racer meets Shin Chan meets Kill La Kill as assassin's. Got some definite gut laughs out of me. The animation style is classic. Together with the storyline, fight scenes, and deadpan reckless jokes, Scissors Seven made for a fantastic watch! Would highly recommend for adult animation and anime lovers."
tt9561862,"Making this review to compare the first season to the second. The first season is almost perfection. Most of its individual episodes have great stories and meaning behind them, they have originality. Even the worst episodes in season one are watchable and have some level of entertainment. The first season has lots of re-watchability to it. But then they released the second season. It's got plenty of episodes with cool concepts but they drag on. I, and many other people, felt let-down by the subsequent season. So far it only has eight episodes, and those eight episodes feel like they were episodes cut from the first season. It isn't horrible, but once you see it all, you don't want to watch it again. Its worst episodes are unbearable and its best are inferior compared to the first season. It contains episodes where the characters make dumb decisions, and its got plenty of episodes that are hard to understand.With all of that said, I'm giving it a 7/10 because the first season is so good. 9/10 for the first season and 5/10 for the second."
tt9561862,"We are faced with an incredibly creative anthology of 18 different stories ranging from an immense variety of animation designs, cinematography, music-sound use, and transhumanism to cyber punk, from robotics to artificial intelligence, from the life of others to anti-militarism: Love, Death & Robots.It was obvious from the trailer that we would be watching interesting things, but I didn't expect that much. The taste of each episode remained in my palate. Death, Love & Robots show the end point of the animation. Cyberpunk, love, death, technology, apocalyptic, a variety of topics such as space is told. So each viewer can find something in the series. There were criticisms of sexism and violence, but I didn't encounter such a problem. Episode lengths range from six to seventeen minutes. Although it is a little short, you can understand the quality when you watch. 9/10"
tt9561862,"Never saw the trailer. Just saw it while browsing netflix, didn't knew what to expect. But the first episode just blew my mind. So awesome. It was like watching watching a video game. The episodes are small but so good. No nonsense. Superb !!!"
tt9561862,"What a unique production! Netflix definitely got something (very) right here. In fact, I wish there would be more quality content like this.Every single episode is intriguing and spectacular; it can be very violent at times, funny and sad. The art is just breathtaking. Writing is on point.So far I liked ""Sonnie's Edge"", ""The Witness"" and ""Beyond the Aquila Rift, ""Good Hunting"" and ""Zima Blue"" the best. More, please, Netflix!"
tt9561862,"Sublimely animated (NSFW) shorts... each with it's own unique and beautiful (& mature) story. Think game cinematic-Animatrix saga with hyper-realistic futurism/multi-dimensional concepts. Absolutely GORGEOUS. I enjoyed each immensely, and cannot wait to see more, hopefully becoming a mainstream format."
tt9561862,"Honestly it just appeared on Netflix so I thought why not give it a try? and I am so happy I did. Every episode is so beautifully animated and the stories keep you interested from beginning to end! The most impressive and immersive thing Netflix has done in a little while, you aren't wasting you're time. believe me."
tt9561862,"I seriously hope Netflix produces more shows of this quality.
Great animation quality together with themes and stories for adults are pretty much non existent. Until now.
This is really worth getting a subscription for. At lest for me it was."
tt9561862,Season one was incredible. A little something for anyone. Great variety and vision in small samples. Like short stories. It was 18 episodes!Season two. Even shorter episodes. Only a few of interest and only 8 episodes with some as shot as 7 minutes.You can always count on Netflix for a bait and switch. Waited over a year for less than an hour of content.
tt9561862,Watched the complete series in one go!!! Could not stop watching!
tt9561862,"I am in awe of how truly great this is.On every level it impresses...Visuals, audio, script, acting, dialogue, atmosphere... It's got them all in spades!Just sit back and let the episodes draw you into their worlds.It is a work of art and should be celebrated."
tt9561862,"I feel like some of the episodes in season 2 were a little too short, and there were less than half as many episodes as season 1, so all in all season 2 was a little disappointing. It's not bad; season 1 just set the bar too high.The animation is absolutely gorgeous, though."
tt9561862,"Once you start watching, you can't stop until it's over"
tt9561862,"I really liked season 1 of the series: a new kind of format, amazing graphics, sometimes thought provoking and serious, even dark, sometimes just simply funny. Diverse themes and animation styles. It was kind of like Black Mirror, but animated. Or like reading a collections sci-fi short stories.But season 2... I was looking forward to it so much, and it let me down. The animations are as good as in season 1, and there is one or two episodes that are kind of OK, but otherwise they have forgotten *the* most important thing that made season 1 so good: the stories. I don't know what they were thinking, but they are very basic in season 2, sometimes do not even make sense. The punch lines are basically missing, or very weak.Season 1 = 10 starts. Season 2 = 3 stars."
tt9561862,"Clearly created both by and for a generation that has grown up deeply embedded in video games, Love, Death & Robots inevitably seems to reflect a similar drop in attention span and a curiously singleminded focus on surface shocks and flashy spectacle at the expense of everything else. Indeed, the storylines (and animation) often feel like little more than intros to games, with as much depth, believability and emotion.The visuals are, admittedly, continually impressive, but there's really almost nothing at all supporting them: the dialogue is lame, cliched and forgettable throughout, the storytelling very weak, practically every joke falls flat, and the voice acting is gratingly amateurish more often than not.It's clear comparisons will be drawn between this and, say, Black Mirror, in that they are both comprised of short, standalone stories dealing mostly with technology and the future, but unlike Black Mirror, at no point does any episode make you think deeply about... well, anything, and no idea raised is fleshed out enough to feel you've been shown anything of any worth. The good news is that, since the episodes are only 15 minutes long anyway, you don't feel particularly cheated, at least at first, but after you've watched a bunch of them, you do begin to wonder what the point of it all is.The better episodes are The Witness, Suits and Shape-Shifters, so I'd recommend checking those out first if curious."
tt9561862,"This show is a masterpiece. Every episode feels like a complete movie. I was surprised that I was able to care for the characters after such a short time. Most shows take 2 or 3 hours to be able to establish that kind of a rapport. The pacing is great, the topics explored are interesting and some of the plot twists are amazing. One of the episodes managed to flip my understanding of all the events completely on its head just in the last few seconds when the truth was finally revealed."
tt9561862,"Black Mirror animation.At least as successful as ""Black Mirror"", interesting and very beautiful series. I started on the advice of a friend and I loved it, and you will too."
tt9561862,"Fantastic frist season, good stories. Was really looking forward to season 2, but four episodes in , its looking very disapointing."
tt9561862,"I am not a fan at all of animation stuff, nor modern scifi and fantasy too. But this series which was advised by a friend amazes me, because it is so gloomy, dark, disturbing, maybe too complex though, that I am addicted to it. Unfortunately, most of those stories could not be adapted for the big screen in classic regular movies. Too shocking for most audiences. I highly recommand it to anyone seeking something different. Don't expect happy endings here, no do not, you would be deceived. Or maybe once in a while."
tt9561862,"Spectacular audio and animation violent,sad,funny good stories.Netflix did a good job,did something that most people do not expept to see.I want more content like that please Netflix."
tt9561862,"Third season in my opinion is much better, story and enternteinment wise, than second season. But none can compare to the first one, obviously.One review mentions this season being dark and dreary... well dooh, it's in the name ""Love, DEATH + Robots"". After season 1, I expect this show to be dark(Death) with some hope(Love) sprinkled in and taking a background and sometimes just for fun Robots added.Only disappointment that it's just 9 episodes."
tt9561862,"Season 1 was very good, with 2 really top quality stories.Season 2 was a somewhat a disappointment.Season 3 was totally WOW with an oscar worthy animated story at the end, as well as 2 other top quality episodes. Just 1 episode was average."
tt9561862,"Season 1, a mind blowing masterpiece with plenty of episodes to indulge. Season 2, a disgrace to season 1. Not only is it incredibly short after a 2 year wait, but the writing is just sloppy. Season 1 had a lot of episodes that made you think ""wow, how does someone come up with this"" while season 2 as a whole seems like something you could scrap together with a couple friends over a weekend.I pray this is a lesson to the people who decided to switch up this season, and that if they do get another chance with a third that they redeem themselves. There are great writers and artists out there who are forced to have limited creativity. LET THEM MAKE SOMETHING FREELY."
tt9561862,Season 1 was an absolutely masterpiece but wtf was season 2?! It felt like teasers with no plots but with a vine time limit of 7 seconds... disappointing asf.
tt9561862,"Although I'd still say that this season is worth watching, I have to also say that it is most definitely nowhere near as good as season 1.First of all, stories of S2 are best described as ""meah"". Aside from the e3 and e4 (that were somewhat interesting and\or thought-provoking) and e6 that made me chuckle a bit, the rest are completely forgettable.Second, this season seams to be positively muted in terms of sheer madness and creative scope of the first one. Why this is would be anybody's guess, but my sense is that the network decided to play it safe instead of embracing the sometimes-provocative insanity of the first season.Finally, this season contains less than half the number of episodes of the first one, why??? I get not being able to film real actors during the time of the pandemic, but what was stopping a bunch of IT and CGI pros from creating a bunch of episodes while sitting comfortably in front of their computer screens at home...truly beyond me.So here we are, still enjoyable to watch, but doesn't even begin to hold a candle to the first season. What a shame, such a missed opportunity."
tt9561862,"All the stories feel incomplete, even for a short story, generic, uninspired and generally lacking in substance. All in all, nothing unlike the first season. Cannot comprehend why someone did not notice this while the script was being written."
tt4803766,"Although TV series like SURVIVOR can be quite entertaining they are for the more part very much manipulated in multiple ways, the producers put up challenges that they think will benefit certain more interesting characters and conflicts are at times nothing more than a production.Here we get none of that, no votes or backstabbings or alliances, no competitions to get immunity or extra nurishments etc. Not even any contact with any outside human sources such as a camera crew or anything because they have to film their experience themselves.The rules are really simple, 10 people are taken to isolated places in the wilderness miles apart from each other. They then have to try to survive off the land, build shelter and find food sources to last them as long as possible. All while surrounded by packs of wolves, bears and cougars and dealing with often extreme weather conditions.The person who stays the longest wins, 500 000 dollars.So there are no gimmicks or game twists merely survival of the fittest and that is why this is a reality series that is definitely well worth checking out."
tt4803766,"Finally a ""non reality"" show that captures your interest up to the final episode. I really don't appreciate reality shows and I blame the Dutch for inventing the ""Big Brother"" and giving birth to this polluting TV Show genre. But I digress..This show is phenomenal, mainly cause, as previously said by warblerluvr (a fellow IMDb user) it lacks of an annoying all-knowing host figure and there is no competition among participants for food or tool rewards which just brings out the worse in humans. I learnt a lot of survival tricks and different ways to manage yourself in adverse situations to the point that I would describe this show not only entertaining but highly educational. Now I really want to experience this kind of survival adventure for myself and learn more about the several techniques involved in the process.Of course there are also a few downs but really understandable ones:You obviously cannot like every single participant and luckily most of the annoying ones are the first and fastest to go, mostly cause they just don't have an inch of what it would take to really embark in such an adventure!Lots of repetitions i.e the same footage and lines reused before and after commercials (I watched it without so I guess for me was even worse) but again, I guess that due to the lack of other form of entertainment but the self filming participants it was just bound to happen.I would have appreciated the network acknowledgement that of course the show is filled with amazing and clearly professional shot footage of nature in all its beauties and adversities instead of pretty much just going with the ""all the footage was self shot by each contender"".All in all this was a great show, my favourite 2 characters from the very first episode proved to be the best and most deserving ones and had an exciting ""head to head"" finale! Great job History Channel, I thank you for this! I will definitely enjoy a second season of this as long as nothing changes and its kept as honest and truthful as season 1 has been!"
tt4803766,"Someone posted, there isn't one documented wolf attack in history. You need to do some research. Many documented attacks plus 5 fatal attacks since 1989. Most recent attack, a 14 yr old boy in MN. He survived. A woman was killed by 2 wolves just a few yrs ago in Alaska.Just the lack of sunshine for so long will cause great psychological stress.Those that give it low ratings probably want a somewhat scripted/planned show like Survivor or Amazing Race.Of course its a slow paced show, no host to try and make it interesting, no competition for food rewards, no hype. It is just men left alone to record their daily struggles."
tt4803766,"I've never felt the need to write a review on IMDb, but the few people who don't give this show a high rating seem to be the only ones writing reviews. Alone is not so much a survival show as a psychology experiment. The contestants are dropped in a dangerous wilderness with just the barest necessities and left to their own devices. Besides having to find shelter, food, and drinkable water, they have to deal with being alone all the time for as long as they can stand. Some of you probably don't realize how hard it is to deal with loneliness. Just watch a prison show and see how people break down in solitary confinement. The one thing they have for company is a little hand camera, and the contestants that last long enough really open up to it. The longer the season lasts the more they bare their soul for all to see. To me it's the most fascinating TV I've ever seen. It makes you appreciate your food, your home, and the people around you more, just by showing you were you'd be without them."
tt4803766,"Finally a proper survival show. Mind you, it has many flaws. But it is a monumental step forward for this type of shows.There is no need for you to know this but I consistently write negative reviews about survival shows. There are a handful of reasons for this but, essentially, they let me down.Not this time. From producers and crew to the ""contestants"", everyone has tried to do the show the way it should be done.The heart of 'Alone' are the folk competing. As time goes on and their situation evolves, viewers are presented with a soulful, tearful at times, rendering of woes and struggles.Some people get ""in their own heads"", eventually freaking themselves out into an exit. Their rationalizations are poignant, and cruel, and humbling,... and only become more so as the days pass.Some people endure and the ones that do, do it on a shoestring. Literally. They gradually devolve into physical and psychological miserable existences, bringing to the fore the inherent, real difficulties involved in true survival situations.This is not Bear Grylls on a weekend adventure... although, I will say, that's a guy that I would like to see competing on this show.Anyway.Some of these guys put their very heart (and then some) on the line. Here is a shout-out to their courage and my appreciation for taking us there, to the edge, with them.Respect."
tt4803766,"There are a lot of""reality"" shows out there that are just not good and most likely staged. This has to be the most""real"" show I've seen on TV. Besides that, it's absolutely the most interesting show I've seen. The mental aspect of being alone for so long always seems to catch up to the contestants. The skills are great, but until you can cope with your emotions, it means nothing. Sometimes the drop off location is not as good as others, but that's the part that shows how good of a survivor these folks are.I highly recommend this show just based on the fact that it is legit and lets you into the lives of very diverse individuals and what they see as important to them. Couldn't recommend this show more."
tt4803766,"As someone who has spent a great deal of time in the back country I can say without a doubt that this is the realest of reality shows. I find it very entertaining watching the contestants do the wrong or right thing and then deal with consequences of there choices. I have also learned a thing or two - like using a tarp to build a boat or something that will float (never considered that, but I have a canoe so I never had to). The longest amount of time I have ever spent alone is 6 days and I have been alone for days many times over the years. I can tell you first hand it can really mess with your head.Storms, vermin, predators, insects even the silence it all effects you. My hat is off to all the contestants who survived for even a few weeks. Your all winners in my book."
tt4803766,"I've watched every season religiously.I think it's the greatest show out there.It inspires me, teaches me, and gives me a longing to get outside.I kearn new things every time I watch it.I love seeing parts of northern Canada and other wilderness areas. Their location selection is amazing. I started watching originally just because where season 6 was.Season 5 was rough because the poor people didn't have any food. Slim pickings in Mongolia. I think the winner was barely at 50 days and all he ate were leaches and mice.Word to the producers (who will never read this) learn from past company, business, and television mistakes.""Don't fix what isn't broken"".You are going to have a vocal minority of your viewership complain about it getting boring. Seeing similar things each season.I promise you, don't change a thing and 80% of your viewership that is silent and doesn't get in in the chat waves will faithfully watch each season, every year, for the rest of time.Obviously the small twists are awesome. Season 4 with the teams was fun. Season 9 making them fly fish because ""regulations"". Those are fun.What I mean, is don't change what the show is, thinking that we're going to get tired of watching people simply survive. Hunt. Eat. Build. Forage. Etc.Season 9, I don't know what producers encourage applicants to talk about or film before they get dropped out there,
But the editing and direction definitely seemed to be ""hey let's emphasize mental health and 'overcoming your past'"". Which are very real things, but when manufactured, you get a victim culture like Jacques who uses the word ""Traumatic "" to describe an otherwise moderately challenging childhood.His father was struggled with alcohol. Not uncommon.Parents get a divorce. Not uncommon.Difficult yes. Added adversity to overcome. Yes.Traumatic? We're your parents murdered in front of you? That's trauma.Up until the 1930s, children worked in factories, often times dieing very young from malnutrition and diseases. Usually missing parents. Terrible conditions to grow up in. They never used the word Traumatic.Your audience are people that take interest in survival. Mental/physical fortitude. Ingenuity. Personal growth.Please don't become a show pandering to new age vocal outliers. Culture fluxes and flows.The things being demonstrated on this show are timeless and more resilient than my current weaker generation.I'm not a back in my day boomer. I'm 31. I'm a millennial.Don't let my generation ruin this show with cultural pressure to be constantly introspectively pandering to self absorbed ideology.They have every other show coming out currently to pander to them. Keep this show our one haven to escape the nonsense of our worldly bickering.Let contestants just muse to the camera without direction.Don't let your editors hone in exclusively on the this is how my childhood made me feel moments.Alone works because you just put a camera on nature and click play.The more you try to bend that to your direction, the less it will be what it was.And you will lose interest from your audience.We want reality.Not ""reality""."
tt4803766,"Shocking I know. A reality show that actually seems real with no interference from producers or outright scripting. I do recommend watching this at a faster speed, I prefer 2x. The show plods along most of the time. The episodes themselves consist of half doing and half talking behind b-roll of the environment, with cliffhangers stuck on each commercial break. There's a lot of downtime with the whole zooming out showing the contestant's area which will have you reaching for the fast forward button.These downsides are mitigated by the heartbreaking moments in each season. Don't be naive like me and immediately dismiss it because it's a reality show. The reviews here are what encouraged me to give it a shot, so thanks ya'll."
tt4803766,"They took Les Stroud's innovation to film himself alone and built a reality show contest out of/around that premise with 10 contestants per season and the results are great. It was a no-brainer really, and i'm surprised no one got around to doing this show until so many seasons later after Les basically laid out the formula minus the contest part, which is really not a bridge too far even for the least impaired and creative producers out there. It took more inspiration to come up with naked and afraid than it did this show, but this show proves that more [hokey, over-produced] is not always better. Let them try to make it, and give them cameras, in an unforgiving environment at a time of year when it only gonna get worse and worse. Let the participants do the rest. Only pay one of your contestants/content producers. How could that plan possibly not have succeeded? Great entertainment for anyone chilling in a warm home with food while appreciating the small things over which others are struggling mightily. Makes a little snack from the fridge/pantry that much more satisfying."
tt4803766,"It's a decent show. I respect the competitors, but it can be so tedious. I think far too much is dedicated to people sitting and whining about their family and home. It would be okay if it were used to punctuate certain moments, but filling each episode with 20+ minutes of it is tiresome.And it's not as if there aren't more interesting things to talk about. Often you don't even get a real good look at the homes people build. If the camera work isn't great then you can animate a 3d model and highlight the features that make it good for survival, etc. Same thing with everything they make and do, and it could be narrated and interesting.Whether you like that idea or not, i'm sure you can agree that we don't need 20 minutes of missing wife and kids each episode. I understand that emotions are part of survival, but as i said.. you can use these cuts for emphasis occasionally. Because otherwise it gets old, fast."
tt4803766,There is so much overlay and intro between the commercials its excruciating. The only way to watch this is to record it first and zip through the filler. They repeat so much stuff as well. They take a great concept of being just by yourself in nature and destroy it with the most commercialized editing drivel possible. And in many episodes (I'm currently in Season 3) they use this breathing sound effect ad nauseum. Its used often more than once a minute. Can you imagine how aggravating it is to go through that - to hear something maybe 100 times in a single episode? Truly the most brain dead editors working on this show.
tt4803766,"Being out there in the wilderness at night with no protection is no picnic, and I can tell you have never done it if you think it is.I can say this because I grew up in northern Canada, and as a kid we would chase away black bears and we saw them all the time when i went hiking with my friends. I was 12 at the time and a group of us would chase these bears away, we lived in a town of about 350 people up near Alaska, a small Canadian mining town, and so I got used to seeing all kinds of wildlife. There was one time an older black bear turned around and started charging back at us after we had chased it across a big baseball field at night, I have never ran so fast in my life, and the kids I was with ran as well, as there was no protection out there on a field with nothing to climb or hide behind, we had a golden retriever who was my family's dog, He had warned me more then once about some bear while camping or fishing, and had many times he had stood his ground protecting us, but that time he ran faster then all of us, and speed past me.I have also read all the stats about wolf and bear attacks, and while it is one thing to understand that there has not been any real wolf attacks documented, it has happened. And there are numerous bear attacks having been documented. There is a big difference between a timber wolf and a normal wolf. When I was around 15 years old, I went hiking and being a kid was oblivious to my surroundings. I was crossing a river, when I felt something, so I looked up, and there was a timber wolf staring at me also crossing the same river, it wasn't the usually way a dog looks at a person, it is very different, you could see he was trying to decide if I was food or not? It was super scary, the two friends I was with bolted, and having no choice at that time, I did the same. When he started to run at us I could tell he still hadn't decided what he was going to do, but it was just instinct. I got to a bunch of trees and climbed up them quickly and he stopped at the base of the tree and looked up. He then heard another hiker call out down the trail, and he gave me one last glance and bolted. if I was alone he might have decided to eat me, seriously, while most Hollywood portrayals of wolfs is ridiculous, attacks do happen, and a timber wolf is a real predator, unlike a normal wolf which i feel like I would have a chance against, a timber wolf is so much bigger and made to kill big prey. Their chests are huge, as well as their paws and teeth.Anyway, it seems like easy money this show, but to the credit of the people who have left, it is another thing when you are actually being stalked by the bear, all the way back to camp, that is serious behaviour and I have no doubt that such a bear would attack when it showed no fear, and actually showed aggressive behaviour. Admittedly wolfs, I would be less scared off, but is is still another thing to have no way of protecting one's self and no way to get help quickly. To those who think it would be easy, well, go try being in a tarp tent, without even a zipper, and see i you think you are as brave when a cougar, bear or timber wolf is scratching on your door.The best thing any of them can do is create a big fire at night, that would go a long way to scare away animals, and create some sort of protection. I can't wait to see anyone here who thinks it is easy to get out there at night, and see how they do. Again, it is a completely different thing to read stats, or to meet bears with the protection of a car, a good tent, even the protection in numbers, then when you are all alone, with no weapon, and know you are pumping fear hormones into the air. You have no idea how scary that can get, it is no wonder that the people who have had predators come back to their camp have left... I do not blame them, even having my experience with bears and wolfs. Maybe the show's producers should take people up on these forums who think it is easy."
tt4803766,"Survivor CBS is were the weak votes off the some what strong, this show, is the only the strong Survive. ALONE!"
tt4803766,"If you're a fan of this show then I'm certain that it goes without saying how terrible the contestants are on season 8 so far, honestly I'm completely baffled how these people were selected to be on this show."
tt4803766,"We love watching these seasons. I kind of wish it kept going year round, like when one ends, another is about to begin. Just another instance of people pushing themselves to the limits, and not always for the money but to meet their own personal goals, see what comes out during their most difficult times while starving and probably sleep deprived.I really like the shows focus on how the people work through the challenges of wilderness survival emotionally, and how they cope with these emotions. Weve seen so many survival TV shows and it almost always comes down to mental fortitude, how hard can someone push themselves physically and why are they motivated?Love the show and hope they make more. Take out the curse word censorship stuff though. Let em curse."
tt4803766,Alone is such an interesting show with interesting people. I love watching the cast build and strategize their survival. So many of the different people have true character and courage that I don't really see in every day life and it inspires me to want to challenge myself. This is the only show I have ever reviewed because it is very special and I think that it's spiritually valuable for all people to see the struggles and the moments of gratitude that you will witness throughout the seasons.I think this show also gives a reminder to city folks like myself that nature is beautiful but incredibly harsh and it takes a steel resolve and great skill to actually survive this world without all the fancy conveniences.I consider this show a must watch!
tt4803766,"I've always been a sucker for survival shows, but the newer shows tend to focus too much on the sensational than what one actually needs to do in a survival situation. Les Stroud being the exception. THat's why this show was a positive surprise for me when I started watching it. I was expecting a show more in the lines of Survivor or something like that, but instead I got a show where each man is pitted not against the other contestants, but against himself and his skills or lack thereof. It was interesting to watch how the guys dealt with the wildlife, climate and the need to build, from scratch, a home in the wilderness. It also helped that the climate on Vancouver Island is much the same as where I live, minus the large predators, so it was extra fascinating since this showed the rigors of trying to live off the land in an area that's damp or wet most of the time. The simple task of making a fire, keeping stuff dry and keeping warm is made that much harder when everything's damp.And all this done by guys that easier to relate to than Bear Grylls. THey seemed like guys you'd meet at the local pub or at work, but with just that little bit of extra interest in survival and the outdoors Another key thing that kept me watching was that you could see their struggle to keep, well, not sane, but motivated to tough it out when the trip back to civilization was just a phone call away. Back to the family and friends and the modern creature comforts. So, all in all an amusing show that actually managed to teach me a few tricks along the way."
tt4803766,"Besides the terrible, cheesy, repetitive, 2000's reality tv editing this show is pretty incredible.Seriously, save yourself 30mins out of an hour long episode by streaming (not watching live, I can't imagine how boring that would be), and fast forwarding through the repetitive recap, intro, post commercial break, and post episode ramblings. Basically skip the fat and get right to the meat of the show.The previous seasons (1-7) were amazing. Season 8 should be captioned The Bum Fight: watch 10 people who need money try to survive the longest at a fishless lake, in a land abundantly occupied by an unhuntable predator.Seriously, It's gone from a survival skill show to a glorified bum fight. ""Who needs the money the money bad enough to push themselves to the brink of starvation to win a chunk of money.""Pair it with the terrible, terrible cheesy editing and this season has taken my favorite show and made it nearly unwatchable."
tt5863126,"Sports documentaries are a personal favourite, but Last Chance U is a rare example of a sport's true colours shown through big budget filmmaking. Set in the collegiate American football setting of small town America, this show highlights everything inherently wrong with the system and the mindset that goes as standard with the sport. Being premier recruitment colleges for those denied a chance in the major leagues (sometimes through bad luck, sometimes through bad choices), they are breeding grounds for dangerous mentalities in children who genuinely know no better.It starts with the coaches; men who have lived with the sport their entire lives, but who don't always understand the way teenagers think. On top of this, their academic teachers toil to get them almost unattainable grades to give them that slim chance of success, constantly fighting against a tide of setbacks and resistance. Finally, the students - arrogant, boisterous and over-pressured athletes thrown into stardom from the minute they discovered their talent, now deluded into thinking they are untouchable future stars.The stupidity is that the cameras only enable these kids to act like superstars. Suddenly they have their inner belief of stardom reinforced by a full film crew following their every move - regardless of whether they win or lose. It's even made clear on the show: every single one believes they are going to make it to the NFL, but only the luckiest ever even get close. The teachers know it and try to make it clear, but nothing will dissuade these students of their dreams. You watch it with mixed feelings of pity and anger; they genuinely know no better, but they act so poorly they must know they deserve nothing from these people who give everything to help them in ways they don't appreciate. The few students who do eventually cross the line and are kicked from school all pretend to repent when the cameras are pointed at them, but the follow-up interviews make it clear some of them are just genuinely bad people.Whilst this makes entertaining television with its various twists, it also presents the damage this society perpetuates. Whole communities suffer: these isolated towns devote their funds entirely to sportsmen they've never met, sacrificing all other academic students and their pursuits. Moreover, these students then push themselves through potentially life-threatening injuries, convinced they can handle ""only another concussion"" or a ""small loss of feeling in their legs"" from being hit repeatedly.By the close of each season, you wonder if any of those you have seen grow throughout the show will be around for many more years. Some of them cannot resist the vicious cycles of crime and delinquency they have grown up in; others simply can't get the grades needed to take the next step. At the end of the day, the schools only care about the score after 60 minutes."
tt5863126,"""Last Chance U"" is a fantastic program in many aspects, but shines the most at a human level. The vast majority of these young men have gone through many hardships in their life, and see EMCC as their golden ticket to a potential future to the NFL. Director Greg Whitely did a fantastic job at capturing the highs and lows, both on and off the field of this band of brothers. You quickly get very invested in the different players as you cheer them on at each touchdown. The show also makes you feel like a disappointed sibling, when some of the players miss class, or fall short from some of their training.Some might argue that Coach Stephens is the centerpiece to this large and complex puzzle, but in my opinion Brittany Wagner, the school's academic adviser, absolutely steals the show. She is the loving and caring mother figure that many of the players desperately need and pours her heart and soul to make sure all of them keep on track for success.Another absolute must watch from Netflix, which will keep you engaged from beginning to end."
tt5863126,"As a French woman, living in France I do not get ANYTHING about American football. But I really loved the show and enjoyed the games; even though everything went a little over my head
This is a really good show and it made me love American football!"
tt5863126,"This series is more of a documentary than a 'netflix-series', and that's the way you should look at this. If you're just looking for a TV-series to lighten you're mood, then this clearly isn't for you. If you are, however interested in the subject of the importance of education, if you want to have a good look at how the American college system works ( especially if you're not from the US this is interesting), than this series might be exactly what you're looking for.What sets Last Chance U apart from other 'reality-series' is the different angles where it is coming from. From the grad student, to the renominated coach Buddy Stephens, to the concerned tutor of the college athletes who is desperately trying to get them graduated at the end of the year. You really understand the importance of the situation, the legacy that these young athletes are trying to maintain. It also doesn't really feel like a real documentary-series, although you keep getting reminded that this in fact has really happened before.However Last Chance has a hard time trying to keep my focus, maybe it was just me but I found myself numerous times being distracted while watching the series. and while this is no doubt a real documentary, I couldn't help myself but finding it all a bit by the books. It almost sounds like a classic football story which you have seen so many times before. I couldn't help myself wondering if some things were really scripted.Still if you can get yourself invested in the stories of these coaches, students and their surroundings, you do really get a real reward out of it, because it does leave a mark. It really gave me satisfaction to get to know the stories of so many lives in this little Mecca of American football. So if this subject is your niche... you should definitely check it out.7,5/10 Verdict: A very interesting and touching look at the life of student athletes"
tt5863126,"Although I routinely read the user reviews for shows and movies, I have never written one. After reading some of the reviews of this sports documentary I felt compelled to make a comment. :Last Chance U"" provides great insight to how life is at Community College and the athletes in the sports programs. As a life long football love the series didn't catch my interest right away and I really regret that fact, because its an awesome show. The student athlete stories are told with great detail and the directors add just the right amount of game action for balance. My concern with the comments about the players seem stereotypical. Seems some people really do not understand these players circumstances even after watching the show. 
A lazy student is not the same as one that is ill equipped as a product of a poor educational system. Some have no idea how to study and have not ever learned study skills. Many students simply are not prepared for college after graduating from high school. Brittany Waggoner makes the same assessment after leaving the show that this problem is prevalent and not confined to Mississippi. I also noticed that she didnt understand why some of the players would basically give up and leave. The feeling of being overwhelmed and behind with trying to catch up is stressful. Many students leave college but their experiences are based on harsh realities that must be dealt with in a caring manner. She does come across and genuinely caring for the students but fails to identify what life is really like for them. I love the show and look forward to watching more seasons !!"
tt5863126,"Great to see the ups and downs with the sport, but man season 4 is depressing."
tt5863126,"The director made sure there was never too long without some game action, or at least some conflict. That was key to keeping our attention. This film of course did not reflect well on football players in general. They come across as lazy, self-absorbed, irresponsible, and feeling entitled. Football is not supposed to simply produce or nurture great athletes. It is supposed to build solid men. The counselor woman had a tough choice. Because the guys were already getting the tough cop routine from their coaches. So she probably didn't want to be too tough on them. She either chose the mom/buddy approach, or it just came naturally, or perhaps we didn't see the tougher side of her off camera. At times I felt frustrated that she wasn't tougher on the players. One thing this show made me realize, is that pro football should have a minor league. Why should guys who have no interest in school, be forced to attend, just so they can continue playing? It's absurd. Just create a minor league, like baseball has.A person could have a career in the minor league, or play in the Arena League, or Canada, etc. There are plenty of options. Why do you need college?Needless to say, this piece of work does not reflect well on African Americans, rednecks, or the South. The coach is a beast, the players seem almost lobotomized, and the culture looks bland and hopeless. The physical geography looked very inviting however.Lesson to be learned: You can't just swear, fight, lie, and screw, and then say an ""Our Father,"" and wash it all away. You have to try not to do those things in the first place.But what made the whole thing worth it, and what I never came close to predicting, was how a bizarre chain of events redeemed and jettisoned the career of one player, who seemed to be almost out of the picture."
tt5863126,"So far I've seen seasons 1, 2 and 5.The documentary is really interesting and surprisingly well done. It's really disheartening though. Talk about a horrible system that these kids come up in. Also, all the preaching done by the coaches is despicable. They should be disciplined for that, and fired if they don't stop. Lastly, the head coach in season 5 says a lot of terribly chauvinistic things that perpetuates rape culture. He often compares winning a game to having their way with a woman...""go out there and get that a**!!!"" and something like ""shove your dick up there and don't ask permission!"" are a couple of the many things he says, and, of course, the players repeat and mimick that type of talk every time. Those quotes aren't verbatim, but that's the gist of it. That coach should be fired, it's terrible that he's been allowed to coach for 40 years.The coach for East Mississippi (S01 &S02) is so verbally abusive ,it's unreal.Good docuseries that highlights a lot of negative aspects of college sports, and there are MANY to highlight."
tt5863126,"A decent documentary, but the content upsets me to no end. Pretty much sums up everything that's wrong with college in the US. Having been a college student at one point. Its upsetting to see the amount of resourced devoted to people who have to business being in school. the fact that there are peoples jobs who are entirely devoted to keeping the athletes in school by basically babysitting them every moment of the day makes me as an educator doubt that any of my students deserve to be in school, or that a college degree means anything at all. And that the coach can do an say things that would get any of my professor colleagues fired 50 times over further illustrates the difference between athletes and students, and why schools should not put a huge portion of their funding to athletics in areas where they will never see that kind of profit. so 6/10 for film-making and 1/10 for subject matter"
tt5863126,"I have a love hate relationship with this show. I love football and I love documentaries, but I don't like this coach (season one and two coach) and I don't even like some of these players. As for those that I do like, I want to see them succeed. But that's not always the goal of a documentary anyway--to get you to like someone or something. A documentary brings the viewer information about a subject they didn't know before or were never even aware of.I consider this show a documentary and not a ""reality show"" because it's not about false narratives or fake drama with a soft script. It's just documenting these young men as they try to make something of themselves in the wasteland of junior college. And junior college is a wasteland.High school is where you get started. That's where you learn, grow, and display your skills for recruiters. A four-year university (preferably a D1 school) is where you're at the next best thing to the NFL and it's your best chance to get noticed by the NFL. JUCO is where you go when you've screwed up. Either you've screwed up in high school or you've screwed up at your four-year university. So, to see this no-man's-land of education and football on screen is fascinating."
tt5863126,The layout of most episodes follows like this:Players train up for a match and you get to follow their lives and the backstory of a bunch of players that the documentary focuses on. Especially the coach.You get an insight in what their studies is like and what hardships they face.The episode finishes with a football match that is edited with suspensefulness like a movie. There is much to like about this series as you see the team spirit throughout and beyond the team to the town folks.
tt5863126,Season 1-2-3 were great! Season 4 was good. But season 5 was just boring for me. Didn't seem like i was watching Last Chance U.
tt5863126,"I'm in love with this show. It has so many amazing things in it. Talented kids with big dreams in need of a lifeline. I love being able to see these kids develop in front of the cameras and some of the teachers shown are truly amazing to be able to get the best out of them. You don't even need to understand football to be able to watch it, but that part makes it even better."
tt5863126,"I enjoyed this show right from episode one. I enjoyed Scooba the most of the three programs that were highlighted. Coach Brown was a roller coaster at Independent, and you really jump from being on board with him, to hoping he gets sent on his way. I believe he most likely let the excitement of the cameras dictate his actions and do things that maybe would have been too far prior. Season 5 overall didn't live up to the others for me, although there were some really good stories and characters to cheer for. And so happy that the coaches wife was able to get out of San Diego cos there ""were too many white people and people of privilege"". I'm sure they were happy to get rid of that attitude to be honest."
tt5863126,"First of all, I never understood why people played or even liked football. Personally, it's just comes across as violent. So, I watched Last Chance U to try to gain some insight. Well, I gained that and so much more.
Besides Game of Thrones, I have never watched something so intensely. I really gained a true understanding of why players play and why people watch. I caught myself riding the highs of winning and feeling the lows of loosing. For someone who doesn't really watch sports, I found it extremely entertaining. I couldn't stop watching!
Now, will I start watching football on a regular basis? Probably not, but this documentary made me understand the passion behind the sport and I gained an appreciation that I didn't have before. A great documentary!!!"
tt5863126,"This one was way better than the other two seasons. That's because the coach had heart and made some interesting and thoughtful statements. He swears just as much as the guy from the other seasons, but he has a sympathetic personal back story, he's younger, and he's quite intelligent.
One thing that strikes me as odd is how locals take pride in the team, when none of the players or the coach are from the town, or even from the state. Essentially they are just a bunch of guys renting the field in town, with little or no interest in the town or the school or classes. Yet the locals refer to them as ""we."" That's the irony of college and pro sports fan culture. The lady English teacher seems nice, but she doesn't have anything interesting to say, and seems kind of obsessed with ethnic pride. I'm not sure what being the English teacher has to do with counseling these knuckleheads anyways, and surely teaching them ethnic pride is not in her job description. 
But she tries. Look, she did say one good thing, if not grammatically correct. Which is ironic since she is the English teacher. ""Everybody does not make it to the NFL."" It would have been better to day, ""Not everyone makes it."" Anyways, these kids are lazy and stupid. Some of it is the fault of circumstance and some of it is their own fault. But I don't think many will make it to the big league. Some may play in Canada or Europe.
But they are entitled dopes either way and that's a darn shame."
tt5863126,"Love this show but they should not have left EMCC. ICC is boring, Coach Brown was not entertaining, the whole 4th season was a depressing train wreck."
tt5863126,"I've only watched the first episode so far, and I'll watch the rest. But I am so dismayed about your frustration with the community college culture. My husband was a music teacher in a CC, and realized that these kids just need a little more discipline, a bit more maturity and maybe a different leader than the parents could provide. He also knew that if you go to a CC, and then are more mature to handle the stresses of a full University, he may have changed the trajectory of an entire family. When my daughter was graduating from high school, my state was in a huge recession and my income dropped by over 50%. She had to go to a local CC while all her friends went to University. I told her that she was a little too social, and had not gotten good enough grades, nor had any athletic or musical talent to get a scholarship. But, not to worry, most of her friends would be back and going to CC after their first year.And they were. She is a very successful news journalist now. Many kids just need to mature and catch up a bit, before they tackle the strain of discipline without parents. I feel so bad for these kids! They have bad parents, a bleak life, bad education....BUT, athletic talent. This is the ONLY way for them to not repeat the sins of their fathers."
tt5863126,"Although I'm baffled how and why EMCC chooses to focus so much on religion instead actual education, the young men, their families and coaches are all coming from their own unique backgrounds, with their own struggles, gifts, goals and abilities - and the uniquely middle-American obsession with football connects them all. It's a slice of Hoop Dreams served up on a plate of Friday Night Lights."
tt5863126,"A bunch of street thugs who wont take responsibility for their life and decisions, what could go wrong there. The last chance they had to make it to a college, and by default, the possibility of a Pro football career AND an education...all of them are a bunch of entitled cry babies."
tt4130418,"Fourth season now and no love for guys like Twista, Tech, Do Or Die, Or Bone thugs-n-harmony? Disappointing there."
tt4130418,"Some have mistaken the movie that was compiled and cut together from this series as the actual series. The movie played at some festivals and has a condensed view. I imagine it still is good, but hopefully some people who mixed those two up, will not confuse others. So if you are here for the longer run (it's almost 3 hours long, split into 4 episodes), you are in for a treat.Though even that running time cannot cover everything, it does cover really interesting points in the history of how this became a cultural phenomenon. It's not just an evolution, but also a revolution at times. And it's really nice that the whole thing has a time-line and starts from the beginning, going towards the the newer age of hip hop. There are quite a few artists who get to say how it was for them and there is a lot of trivia shared. It's more broad in that way, which it has to be, because if covers not just one style. So while this may not be definitive and you may not find your favorite artist in this, it is one of the best looks inside and beyond Hip HopEdit: Just watched the second season. And while I didn't expect one to come (2 years after the initial season was made), it is as good as one would imagine. In-Depth and a lot of interviews and background information. You can feel the love through the screenEdit 2: even more seasons and maybe no end in sight? I wouldn't mind, because the quality is there and the interviewer as someone in the game himself, knows what he talks and asks others about! Even if the Biggie and Pac thing has to be condensed it finally gets spoken about to here. But there's also the dirty south and so many more things, that as a rap fan you may have heard about or are at least interesting enough for those who did not live back then to experience now."
tt4130418,"I really enjoyed this series documenting different periods in the formation of hip-hop. Although I feel like it didn't necessarily do enough to describe the anger and philosophy that was a huge part of hip-hop (except during its parts about the Message and gangsta rap), it provided a fairly well-rounded historical analysis of the musical interplay that allowed the form to progress, to grow richer and more varied, and to move beyond the party music of the late 70s to a more socially conscious art-form. The most important and enriching aspect of this show is the commentary provided by hip-hop legends and people who were there, as well as how it shines light on some unsung heroes of early rap music. It was extremely watchable and interesting, and I can't wait until Season 2 when it delves into the 90s and hip-hop explodes and becomes the cultural juggernaut that it is today."
tt4130418,Today's generation need to understand the roots and history of hip Hop and I feel this documentary does a good job of showing how hip hop developed within its own lifespan. I'm happy there wasn't too much emphasis on the pac/biggie quarrel and program really shows you where hip hop started from. Only down point to this is I feel there should have been a series 3 to cover more content about hip hop.
tt4130418,"So far, I love this documentary, but I'm literally just waiting for them to feature Bone-Thugs-N-Harmony! Seriously, when they came out, it was a sound like nothing I ever heard before. The flow of these guys was incredible! They really didn't play them on MTV, so as a kid I would watch the JukeBox channel to see if people would order it and try to listen to it over and over and over again. It was the most ordered video at the time, all day, everyday! I just can't understand how this group could have been overlooked! Total injustice to the world of hip-hop! They keep saying...""Ain't nobody ever heard a sound like that before!"" While this is true with so many groups, this could not be more true about Bone for sure! Very disappointed they didn't get the props they so rightfully deserved!"
tt4130418,"Hip-hop was my life growing up, as it was the life of so many around me. My earliest memories were Run DMC, Kurtis Blow and the Beastie Boys. In fact, I remember trying to ""scratch"" on my mom's record player because of hip-hop. So to see this four part tribute to its origins was just magnificent.The team that put this together went back to the genesis: Bronx, New York. They started with the underground parties of Kool Herc and progressed through the timeline from there stopping at the contributions of Afrika Bambata, The Furious Five, The Sugarhill Gang, Run DMC and others.What cannot be overlooked is the contribution of Grandmaster Flash. What he did for hip-hop was nothing short of wizardry. He was a scientist when it came to mixing and spinning two turntables. I was floored to hear about how he started and what he started with. It was amazing to hear about a music style that blossomed in the 80's but can really be traced to a time period well before that.I think anyone that has a serious interest in hip-hop should watch this documentary. It was somewhat nostalgic for me because many of the artists mentioned and interviewed were artists I enjoyed as a kid. I was slightly disappointed that some--what I consider pioneers--were not mentioned. Those like KRS One, Fat Boys, Doug E Fresh, Whodini, Salt-N-Pepa, Slick Rick and more. I also would have liked to see hip-hop's first entry into movies as I remember Krush Groove, Breakin' and Beat Street.Even with those absences I was impressed. There's only so much you can cover anyway and I know they tried to hit the highlights. It is still a seminal work that has paved the way for even broader endeavors. This was an essential lesson in hip-hop 101 that has no substitute at this time."
tt4130418,"Based on the first season, I love this series... It's just so entertaining!
I'm sure some stuff is being fast forwarded and glossed over, but for what it is... I am thoroughly entertained and informed...My only gripe is that when Shad roll up and meets one of the OGs, I wish there was some teeny, tiny way to infer a small passage of time, because he rolls up, shakes hands, says hi, then immediately goes, ""Let's start with when you got together with so and so..""It's minor, I know, and I know it's (probably) not the reality of the meetings/interviews, but it's playing like he says hi and hits them with the question - so cold.Does that make sense?? Like, am I the only one who's taking it like that??"
tt4130418,A must for hip hop heads. Truly appreciate this program and hope they continue with some more episodes. Would love to see a episode on the artists whose breaks were used and what they thought about their music being repurposed. Very entertaining I mowed through the episodes and hope they do more.
tt4130418,"There is a lot here and covers the basic of a lot of hip-hop, but misses the opportunity to talk about so many influential artists in the geographic locations they cover. Docu-series is very well made a produced, really great interviews."
tt4130418,"This show is a fantastic look at Hip Hop with the same character flaw suffered by every bit of media on the subject - the prevailing thought that all roads lead back to New York.Just call it what it is for a change, please.The Evolution Of NEW YORK Hip Hop (and a smattering of other Hip-Hop hubs as long as they're not LA)This series is now 8 episodes deep and yet only ONE episode gives attention to LA. Hell even the episode they did on the Bay Area kept insisting on how they owed their roots to New York. East coast hip hop culturalists and journalists will never miss an opportunity to make every other hip hop epicenter seem like a pale comparison of NY, just a bunch of people who appropriated the culture from the true artists in the five boroughs. Houston, LA, Seattle, St Lou, Atlanta, Miami, Charlotte...they're all just imitators. Some better than others but imitators nonetheless.As an example, in episode 8, they spend the entire episode talking about the rise of Nas, Wu-Tang, and Biggie at a time when West Coast Hip Hop was CLEANING UP on the charts. They even admit that New York was struggling trying to reinvent themselves after their short-lived Afro-Centric movement burned bright and died quickly. But when they mention that the West Coast was on top, it's only to set the stage as to why Biggie became the savior of New York Hip Hop.And THAT is why west coast hip hop fans dislike east coast hip hop so much. It's not the music. It's the attitude. New Yorkers are so busy telling everyone else how great they are that they can't spare the time to admit how great west coast rap was. It's as if they're feeling forced to defend how bad east coast rap got before west coast rap forced them to step up their game.Truth?? This is a great documentary. But it's a great documentary about east coast hip hop. So much of what's a part of the fabric of hip hop is now tied up all over this country, from St. Louis and Atlanta to Miami, Chicago and Detroit to Houston, and yes New York to Los Angeles, that making a doc called the ""Evolution"" of hip hop without admitting that the current incarnation is a product of ALL points is just flat disingenuous. It smacks of a group still hanging their hat on some great thing they did in high school that still makes them cool at 50. Hey New York. Don't be like Melle Mel, old as hell and still claiming that you deserve respect for starting something that has long since outgrown you. Accept the praise graciously as the progenitors for a change and start talking up those who've taken it farther than you ever dreamed...no matter which borough or major city they come from.But yeah, give it a watch. You'll learn more about a bunch of marginal New York rappers than you ever thought you would or even wanted to know."
tt4130418,Made me truly appreciate hip hop.. go watch it if you wanna understand the what and why of hip hop. Along the way you will hear some awesome music
tt4130418,"I am not a hip-hop connoisseur but this documentary made me dive deeper into this remarkable genre.Here is another testimony that, when people are facing hardship, there is a hunger for art and people are going to get down and cook some for themselves. Music and lyrics become nourishment but also the weapon against a corrupt system. The film was cleverly cut, the editing working as a metaphor which often illustrates opposing views.Hip- Hop Evolution manages to balance out the history and the atmosphere of that time with a presenter that adds a combination of enthusiasm and humbleness to the mix. Pertinent questions unveil gems of knowledge coming from the pioneers of hip-hop."
tt4130418,"I expect season 2 episode 1 to be all about Tupac, 2Pac, Makaveli, and Pac. It would be nice to see Dre and Snoop contribute to this informative documentary that abruptly ended, but somehow I doubt it. There are nearly 3 more decades to cover. If there is no season 2 it will be a crying shame."
tt4130418,"I really enjoyed this look into the origins of hip hops origins, from the instrumentation to the fashion everything is covered really well. My only problem with it is it ends without mentioning 2 of the biggest evolutions in hip hop history and that's The Notorious BIG and Tupc Shakur, my guess is that they're saving that content for hopefully a second season but right now this is just missing a big story. To be fair though both of those men have passed so the information needed to really get a solid amount of history is gone.I would also love for a potential second season to talk about the rise of Southern hip hop and the explosion of what is now the driving force of what hip hop is to this day. Outside of that I really liked this, one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. I would recommend Ice-T's the Art of Rap documentary to anyone that enjoyed this also very good."
tt4130418,"I really loved this series. For me Shad has a brilliantly low-key and easy style with the people he's speaking to; a lovely way of really getting them talking. As a fellow rapper it's clear he's passionate about the subject and genuinely engaged in the conversations.BUT as a major fan of the genre since the early nineties the one thing that feels to have been significantly overlooked in my mind is female rappers/ mc's. You'd think ladies really didn't play much of a part in this world.Queen Latifah, Lil' Kim, Rah Diggah, TLC, Missy and her partnership with Timberland are all briefly touched on, but it really is brief and not representative of their influence on the industry. Tbh arguably one of the biggest female rappers Lil' Kim is mainly on there to talk about Biggie and not her own artistry.Also what about Foxy Brown, Eve, Salt 'n' Peppa (& Spinderella), Lauryn Hill etc? Let's have some more episodes with a focus on this please :-). Also no Arrested Development?Just means you'll have to make more, it's a win-win ;-)"
tt4130418,"I watch documentaries on and off. Most don't keep me interested for 90 min so I wasn't keen on watching one with multiple seasons. However, I finally decided to watch it last week and now I have finished all four seasons. I was so bummed out to realize I was finished. What a great history lesson for anyone who loves music and hip hop!! I grew up during all of this and lived in the LA area so my perspective was really one sided. It was so informative to hear how it started in NYC - which I knew but not the full story - then to get up to speed on all the other areas of the country; and styles that spawned. In the first few episodes I created me a ""Hip Hop Archive"" playlist and as I learned of artists I must have added 200 songs!Great job and I can't wait for the next season"
tt4130418,"OK, in the title it has the word EVOLUTION.Unfortunately it's broken into regions. East and west and Chicago and Atlanta and...That doesn't work for someone like me that really doesn't follow hip-hop, but loves most music and wants to learn about it's evolution.Here and there you get little beeds on knoweldge, like how it originated from Funk, how a lot of the stars I have heard about came from this or that club, how it has roots with the Black Panthers......but none of that is presented in a way that you can look at the series and understand how it moved to become what it is.I mean, I am from the 90s, I understand the East Coast/West Coast thing. I get that, but I also get that hip-hop had to originate and evolve to even get to that, and that evolution is why I watched the series.It's cool that I learned things about an art form I really don't pay attention to, I just wish they would have on how hip-hop actually evolved as a whole before they did the regional thing."
tt4130418,"The show takes you through the evolution of hip hop, doesn't matter if you're a total hip hop head or not.
It's a raw account of a people making their souls heard."
tt4130418,"Great insight - especially into the early years. Even the 80's and 90's, good snapshot of what went on.Missing though, as in not even a mention of Bone Thugs, Nore, Redman, (who was visible in a few shots), Jada (and rest of The Lox), Big Pun, Foxy Brown, Scarface, The Game and not to mention after Pac and Biggie, came DMX!!No mention of Nas' later albums and only 5 mins of the WU!!They're all part of the evolution.....which has now passed."
tt4130418,"From the slums of Shaolin to the west coast, southern rap and everything in between, Hip-Hop Evolution covers some of the most popular hip-hop sub-genres over the past several decades.I'm no musicologist, but this documentary seems to be reasonably thorough with the time it has. No sides are taken when it comes to beefs or different styles of hip-hop. They're all given credit for their influence and ideas.Shad, himself an ill MC, seems to take a sincere interest in every aspect of hip-hop and appreciate everyone he interviews. He makes the atmosphere very positive without sounding like he's just sucking up to people or promoting them for money.Many of the interviewees are interesting, rarely filtering their opinions. Obviously, a lot of them had run-ins with crime and family issues and hip-hop was a healthy escape from that and more legitimate way to make money.Some of the genres don't impress me so much, sounding more like just shouting or doing drugs and nothing else, but every area seems to have at least a few dope groups and songs. My heart's in New York though - Wu-Tang, Mobb Deep, Nas, Gang Starr, Black Moon, etc.I highly recommend this well produced trip through memory lane for any fan of hip-hop. I learned plenty from it and enjoyed the beats and feel of the times that it captures."
tt3501734,"An ensemble of Australian kid actors, with some of the best comedic timing I've seen, makes this show captivating. It goes back to the idea of: ""tell me a story"" as in this show a motley crew of diverse students, pretty much tell the story of their day at school (particularly at lunch time) with flashbacks that make it all the more funny and remarkable. The writing is crisp, but it's the kids' performances that truly make the show stellar!"
tt3501734,Cracking show. I love it and my kids love it. The stories are relatable and not the same old same old. Great to have them narrating the stories and even better to not have any canned laughing like irritating Disney shows when a joke is made. Only shame is they look too old to be playing school kids in the specials. Maybe could have done without them.
tt3501734,"I came across this when it was on Netflix a few years ago and I, fully an adult, binge watched the entire thing in a day. It's the best show and I genuinely enjoyed every single bit of it, still mad it didn't get picked up for another season so I came to let my frustrations and appreciations out in this review thank you"
tt3501734,"My sister , of whom has an 8 year old, told my husband and I about Little Lunch. We were skeptical. But once we started watching it, we were hooked! This show is hilarious. Rory is SO funny! And when the characters look directly at the camera and speak...PRICELESS! So we wound up binge watching. We are SO excited for season 2!!! You will not be disappointed. I mean, we didn't even have a kid in the room watching! So I'd say this show is age appropriate for any age. Also, the kids in this show are respectful of adults, not like some of the Nickelodeon or Disney shows- where the children are Very disrespectful and they try and pass off as comedy. Little Lunch is genuinely a funny great little show!"
tt3501734,"I have started watching this with my 10-year old girl. What a delight. Both of us end up laughing and wanting to watch another episode. The cast is superb and the comedic timing perfect. The interactions are great and feel relatively realistic as well. While we were not sure what to expect, and the opening sequence has a sesame street feel (leaving us to wonder if the show would be 'too young'), once we started watching it, we knew it was going to be fine and age appropriate. The writers do a great job as well, setting the story lines up and keeping the characters consistent. Some very funny scenarios are created. Can't wait for another season!"
tt3501734,"I Have a little sister the age of 7 and she watches all these crappy shows like Liv and Maddie and Jessie which are just crappy copies of the last show that was canceled. But this show is amazing , i watch the office a lot and this show reminds me of a kid version of it. It's not annoying and pretty entertaining for the parents and older siblings. Definitely not a show that I watch by myself but ill watch it if my sister is watching it in the main room. Great show!"
tt3501734,"This Australian gem has been watched many times by my family and everyone from 40 to 4 loves the talented ensemble cast of children and the great comic timing.
The child characters are believable and we have fallen In love with all of them and their idiosyncrasies."
tt3501734,"I'm from the United States and my girls used to love to watch this show with me. Wish the show went on longer. It makes me hungry and laugh.
I would say the show is PG rated. There is a slight inappropriate joke or two, but nothing too bad. See the show first, if you want to be careful at what your kids watch."
tt3501734,"Little Lunch is the epitome of the tropes of Australian primary school. I'm currently 7:48 into episode one and the character development has really brought these mid teen actors playing children to life. Although, did see spoilers that Melanie's dog is called Rudy. Upsetting, though nevertheless this shows Australia's commitment to great television."
tt3501734,"Genuinely this is such a great show. As far as Australian comedy-drama TV series go Little Lunch is certainly up there, being genuinely funny and easy to watch. I always come back to Little Lunch when I'm having a bit of a downer, because the humour in the show is just spot on. I'm not even the target audience and it is one of my favourite shows - I highly recommend it if you haven't already seen it, and even if you have, take this as a sign to go and re-watch it. Maybe this was the peak of Australian TV - who knows? I certainly reckon it's a high in Aussie broadcasting - the content spans many age groups in terms of entertainment factor, making it the perfect show to watch if, say, your little cousins are over and you want to watch TV."
tt3501734,"This show is a miracle. Not a single charismatic actor on screen, not a single interesting thing talked about, the worst acting of all time....is this an intentionally bad show to troll us or something? I did not know a Tv show could be this bad. This is just bad. Really bad. I'm without words."
tt3501734,"Do you find it hilarious when little kids make their problems sound like adult issues? Then why aren't you watching Australia's Little Lunch?This 15 minute ""mockumentary"" takes on Office feel as it follows six kids who embellish and over dramatize stories during the most important time of their day--lunch (or in their case a snack time that takes before lunch). It originally aired in 2015 in Australia and then was on Netflix. Now you can find it on Amazon Prime Video. It's super cute and definitely worth the watch if you're looking for something light-hearted and feel good. It's not just for kids!"
tt3501734,"As a parent of a boy with ADHD and a primary school teacher, this is one of my favourite shows to watch with my boy. They make the kids be kids but still find funny little stories for each episode.But it's the actors that sell it. Each has their personality and, like so many Australian shows, don't rely on being loud or annoying in order to keep kid's attention. Rory, of course, is my boy's favourite. All the little things he does really validates my boy's experience at school. My boy was in stitches when they were talking about Rory chewing everything.I wouldn't be surprised if Rory, and some of the other kids, are just acting as themselves. They are so immersed in their characters that it's the best explanation."
tt3501734,"Child actors can be a huge hit or miss. In Little Lunch, all six of the child actors are a HIT. Their acting is so good that it was hard to believe they were actually acting. Every episode is vibrant and humorous enough for adults to enjoy as well as kids. It's the sort of dry Aussie humour that I love.It was also filmed at St Kilda Primary School, which I attended as a kid, so as an Aussie who lives in the States, I loved getting to show this to my kids so that they could see where Mummy went to school. We've watched this series several times over, and I am looking forward to watching it again."
tt5846856,"Just great.... fun, catchy songs and educational (and not just for the kids!)"
tt5846856,"Quite suprised to see a high quality content for childrens. Very educational and too many catchy original yet child friendly songs. Great characters fit very well with the brightful tone and exciting instrumentals. Great animations/graphics, explosion of bright colours and compelling voice castings. Its hilarious, adventurous and a bit of scifi/fantasy. No specific plots, just educational stuff, touching one topic per episode. To be honest, the characters reminds me of a mobile game. Totally eye catching for childrens and babies, even pets. Very entertaining even for adults, high rewatch value. Highly recommended."
tt5846856,"I am 31 years old with an almost 3 year old (oct), and he's addicted. I put on Netflix, he sees and yells for storybots, then sits and stares until someone gets hurt, then he laughs (moms sense of humor, lol). He repeats back to me things he learned from the show. And the clincher- I, yes the 31 year old, LOVE this show! I actually learn things from time to time, and I think it has quite a few funny moments!!! My only thing is, I'm not a big fan of the big purple one-their voice, their attitude, just that character. Also, sometimes it's a little too silly. For instance, its teaching really cool stuff, but kind of adhering to a younger audience."
tt5846856,"I have a 2 yr old and 4 year old and we are all addicted to this show. The songs are super catchy and we are all memorizing information about the Solar System, dinosaurs, principles of flight, bones in your body.. the list is long! I am a private pilot and I was really impressed with the way they display the forces of flight. Technically correct and broken down for kids to understand it. I really like Judy Greer and Weird Al Yankovic. And the guest stars are really varied and fun- ""How Does Night Happen?"" with Jay Leno ""How Do Airplanes Fly?"" with Kevin Smith ""Why Do I Have To Brush My Teeth?"" with Whoopi Goldberg ""Why Is The Sky Blue?"" with Riki Lindhome and Kate Micucci of Garfunkel and Oates ""Where Do French Fries Come From?"" with 'Weird Al' Yankovic ""Where Does Rain Come From?"" with Tim Meadows and Chris Parnell I really hope that Netflix keeps making this show."
tt5846856,"We just found this and the kids love it. I liked the guest appearances (kind of a nod to the parents watching, as the kids have no clue who any of the actors are), and it was interesting for me as well as educational for them. Oddly enough, three of the episodes were questions my incredibly inquisitive 7 year old had asked me within the last week or so - night, airplanes, and the sky being blue; this explained so much better than I did! The song breaks are fun (Chicken Bop is a new household favorite, especially with the 5 year old!), the different animation styles and the mix of live-action and animation keep things interesting, the bonus fun facts throughout the episodes are great, and even the little filler bumps with Hub and Bub get laughs from the kids. The way complex concepts are explained through exploration and investigation and then further reinforced with a song is fantastic. This is one show I definitely don't mind my kids watching because they learn so much while enjoying something that's still fun and silly (but not so horribly annoying that I can't stand being in the room with it). I hope they make more episodes!"
tt5846856,Amazing show. Please make more. My son has watched all the seasons over and over again and learns so much. The music is super catchy and entertaining. Love its
tt5846856,"This show is hilarious. When my son watches it, the whole family gathers to watch it with him... seriously! Everyone from our 3 year old to his grandparents love watching this show. The songs are well produced and catchy. The different styles of animation (including claymation, which I adore) are all very well done. As an author of non-fiction picture books, I'm super impressed with how the science is explained as well. It's clear, memorable, factual, and never talks down to the kids. It introduces new learning in a fun and approachable way. The guest stars are also a fun addition. Really, the whole show hits a home run. I only wish there were more episodes!"
tt5846856,We love this show in our house. It's funny and educational at the same time. I like fun celebrity guest stars. The songs are awesome as well. They get stuck in our heads all the time. Hoping they make more episodes soon. My son has already watched the first two seasons a countless number of times.
tt5846856,I really hope they keep making this show. My son & I love watching it. The guest appearances and songs are awesome. I've also learned a few things I didn't know.
tt5846856,"I learned a lot, its funny.everyone loves it ,it's not annoying.the characters are cute , it keeps kid's attention. There are celebrity guests !"
tt5846856,"I have a 4 year old daughter that can't get enough of this show, and we really hope they keep producing more episodes. I love the questions asked by the kids and how the Storybots go about solving their scientific inquiries. Heck, even I learned a thing or two when I watched the ""Why is the sky blue?"" episode. They don't make it cheesy or dumb it down. They break it down into parts that are easily understood by toddlers and have great humor that is safe for kids of that age, but still funny to adults. The songs are great for this age group and short for their attention spans. My daughter gets up and dances to a lot of them. Just an overall wonderful show!"
tt5846856,"We love storybots here ! Even the grumpy nine year old loves it. 
Season two just came out and has already explained so many things they've asked and I didn't answer nearly as well as these little robots. I could never explain computers as well as Snoop Dogg lol"
tt5846856,"I loved the premise of this show and happily turned it on for my two boys - aged 4. Firstly- the delivery is so frenetic it makes a high octane Hollywood action movie look slow. There is a 2 minute scene of a lion bouncing around on screen making a series of weird and desperate noises which is enough to give one epilepsy, and I'm still not sure what it's doing in an episode about volcanos.Most of the characters don't talk- they yell, and most of the time they seem insanely stressed out and so overcaffeinated they exude it from their eyeballs.Every movement is a jolt, every expression and emotion taken to its extreme. The questions posed and answers given are lost in a quagmire of inane chat. Perhaps the point of this is to prime our children for the Internet age, where they have to sift through endless clickbait and distractions to get information.If you are appealing to children, who biologically have shorter attention spans, why make a show 25 mins long when you could answer any questions posed (wrapped in a fun storyline) in 10 mins?Just- no!"
tt5846856,"This has got to be the most entertaining and intellectual thing I have ever put on for my kids. My wife and I sit there with them and learn too! It's fun, great songs and the topics are well laid out for anyone to understand! I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!"
tt5846856,"Perfectly wonderful show that captures the imagination, attention, and cleverly wraps it all in brilliant educational material of complex subjects for younger minds to grasp and enjoy!!! I love this show!!!! My husband told me how much he and our 2 year old laughed and learned!! Now the rest of our family gets caught up in watching along with the elementary and high school kids. I haven't seen such good work in a long time! Bravo! Well done! (They also have a sound track for the excellent music they've done! Don't miss out on it!)"
tt5846856,"We've been watching story bots with our 4 year old since he was 2. He still loves it two years later, and out of everything he watches, Storybots never gets old or boring. Ofr him or us Its a fantastic show with amazingly cool music and subjects for kids. Its intelligent but well pitched for toddlers. Very highly recommended. Lets hope they make more."
tt5846856,"First, I'm pretty selective. I have no patience for stupid programming, especially stupid programming aimed at children.Storybots is smart, funny and memorable. Weird Al does a bunch of the music, but their are several other contributing artists. They have celebrity guests, and Judy Greer is one of the main characters.Their music sticks with you"
tt5846856,"I absolutely love watching this show with my son and my daughter. We love the music my mother even sings along. My son has learned so much and now refuses to watch peppa pig, trust me when I say put this on for your little ones. We know all the words by heart and can't wait for season 3!"
tt5846856,This is so much better than 95% of the cartoons out there. It actually teaches the kids things and I think I learned a thing or 2 myself. The songs are catchy and fun. My kids love it.
tt5846856,This is very nostalgic I remember watching this in my wolf ranch school it was very entertaining!!! I will recommend every Generation Alpha kid to watch this because us Zoomers are Watching Some of The Good Stuff while y'all are watching your Stupid Cocomelon or YouTube kids I want every kid under 16 to watch because the Amazing Actors/ Rappers That are In This Masterpiece of a TV Show I Want This Show to not Stop because Parry Gripp is a Nostalgia YouTube Creator I want more of Him I need him to not quit and not stop because it makes me Happy that they Still Going! - That Young Movie Lover!!!
tt5846856,"Great stories, lovely characters and educational topics all with catchy tunes. My autistic 5 year old is currently obsessed with them and I don't blame him! Each episode is just about the right length to keep a short attention span and they're genuinely interesting. My little boy has been able to learn all about the planets, shapes, colours and the human body - despite having real difficulty with classroom learning. I can't praise the Storybots highly enough.Please make more episodes (and finish the collection of talking cuddly toys - we need Boop and Bing!).Absolutely recommend giving them a watch - 100%"
tt5846856,"With two young children, I watch a lot of kid shows- all of which are screened by me and my wife. Storybots is by far the best of them all. It's entertaining, intelligent, and funny for both kids and adults. I never have an issue when my kids are watching a marathon of Storybots because I know they will always learn something. They also have an amazing list of guest appearances- definitely a bonus. Highly, highly recommended."
tt6461346,"The first season of this Korean drama opens with Prosecutor Hwang Shi Mok discovering the body of a murdered man. The case will see him working with policewoman Lieutenant Han Yeo Jin. They are very different characters; thanks to an operation when he was a teenager Shi Mok has reduced emotions. There is an early suspect but questions are soon raised about his guilt as evidence emerges suggesting the victim had been involved in corruption. The case draws attention to tensions between the police and the prosecution service.The second season opens with two students drowning at a beach where the closure notices had been taken down. Those who took the notices down are quickly apprehended but they have contacts in high places and are soon released; Shi Mok is on the case. Once again he finds himself working with Han Yeo Jin as both are seconded to a group examining the relative powers of the police and prosecution service. Both sides are keen to show the other in a poor light so look into wrong doing in the other service. Tensions further mount when a prosecutor disappears; evidence suggests kidnapping or worse.I really enjoyed this series. It doesn't waste time with needless exposition concerning the rivalry between police and prosecution; it treats the viewers as intelligent enough to pick it up as the story progresses. The cases in both seasons are interesting and the main characters are fun to watch. Cho Seung-woo does an outstanding job as Hwang Shi Mok but Bae Doona steals just about every scene she appears in, as she manages to produce laughs with the subtlest of gestures, without every becoming a comedy character. The rest of the cast are impressive too. Overall I'd certainly recommend this.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles."
tt6461346,"I keep hearing that South Korea is the emerging giant in producing great TV series in a variety of formats: comedy, fantasy, spy-intrigue or (in this case) police-mystery. Mercifully, this one ends after 16 episodes - I say that, since, once you get hooked on these series, nothing else scheduled in your life happens. You are glued to the set as the mystery deepens and unfolds (I watched a 20-parter in 2016, and after 20.9 episodes, the good guy -- on his way with a ring to marry the girl he fell in love with in episode 3-- gets picked off by a sniper. Aaaauuuughhhh!. Meantime, my car was repossessed, and my wife ran off to join the circus. But, what great series!In this case, 'Stranger' (as named on Netflix) follows the trials of Prosecutors Huo-Jin (Bae Doona, who appears to be the Sandra Bulloch of Korean miniseries) and Huang (Jo Suang-Hoo) as they investigate a few murders and attempted murders of police accomplices and 'ladies-in-waiting' - and, eventually, a pretty young prosecutor, who seems to have a bit of a crush on Huang. Higher-ups seem to be behind the crimes, and the script certainly gives the impression that the Korean culture is dominated by title, authority and political favors on the part of elitists in the Police Force and business. Huang, though, is relentless and strictly business. He has a personality defect that causes a lack of empathy or emotion. So, he shares only what he needs to, and in as few words as possible. I haven't quite finished the series, but I don't expect to see him in a passionate affair with any of the available female characters. He has the charm & appeal of a pack of tin foil--a cross between Spock and Monk. He's smart, though and the higher-ups are terrified he will finally tumble onto their nefarious secrets.Music and sets are delightful, characters are rich and continually developed, and the cinematography is brilliant and imaginative. New twists unfold every episode, keeping you compelled to keep watching.. 9/10 - Enjoy!"
tt6461346,"Season 1I can count on the fingers of my one hand the series that I could consider at par or better than this. On every count it is an absolute winner. I have always believed that a true thriller is more cerebral than physical. The action happens by way of intellectual warfare than actual gunfights and muscled maniacs showing us all kind of choreographed war dances. This series is absolutely such a production, but make no mistake it neither lags nor allows your attention to waiver. Towards the end narrative could have been tighter and it could have gone in another direction. But perhaps that just comes down to personal preferences and cultural perspectives. All in all a highly recommended thriller and hands - down a shoo - in to my personal all time favourites. Kudos to the production team as well as the actors.Excellent!Season 2I have kept my review of Season 1 as is. As far as season 2 is concerned, it does not possess the intensity, the menace (yes there was nuanced menace underlying the first season that gave it such intensity), and the powerhouse performances from the supporting cast. Season 2 is slow burn and meanders a bit during the middle. But it is still good and I enjoyed it. If you compare second season to the first season it does not hold candle to it. But as a standalone it is an enjoyable watch. It has meaningful suspense, it has character development, good performances and a plot with some merit. It lacks in direction. I felt the director sat on the wall about what kind of series he wanted. He got confused and he passed on that confusion to the viewers. This gives the second season periods when we are confused WTH is the season going. Production was as usual top - notch.Good enough. Hope third season would be better!Season 1 - Rating 9 Season 2 - Rating 6"
tt6461346,"I have to confess that I am a k-drama addict, but that said, this is by far one of the best Korean TV dramas ever - surpassing not just the usual run of Asian dramas, but also most US TV dramas.This show is from a new writer, her first TV script. I think it will not her last. The main star for me is Bae Doona, who I first came across in ""Sense 8"". The show is absent many of the far too common k-drama tropes that make so many of them seem rather silly - like dozens of totally incompetent cops, the stupid sidekick that is supposed to be funny but seldom is, and several others. A very tightly written script with almost no ""WTF?"" moments."
tt6461346,"Rarely do some creative content come that deliver a truly gratifying experience and I wouldn't be wrong to say that Stranger/Forest of Secrets is part of that consortium. Writing/Cinematography/Editing: These three form a fragile pyramid that some dramas aren't able to fully comprehend and implement but Stranger isn't like that. The composition of the above three is such that the story progresses seamlessly. The only thing abrupt would be your own heartbeat, ha ha. The screenplay pools you in, like a magnet, from the first episode itself, binding you inside its sly labyrinth of deft writing. Characters: aren't fictitious, and by that I mean the characters are portrayed in such a crude fashion wherein you wouldn't fully like or dislike either one, they are in a sense, truly human like and not far-fetched. They all have their faults and strengths, they're not necessarily bad or good. I'm not saying you won't form favorites, of course, we all love our protagonist Hwang Si-mog, he is someone who's so elemental, you can't forget him. Every actor has traveled so deep into their characters, watching their work unfold is really engaging. Personally, after first seeing Jo Seung-woo in Inside Men, I have grown such a liking to him, I can't explain. He's just brilliant.Music: the composition is such that it is subtle yet striking at the same time, complementing the arrangement of scenes in the drama in an aesthetically satisfying manner. The music sets the mood so perfectly, it really is pleasurable.I have never written reviews about a drama/film/song and whatnot before but upon completion of this Drama, I felt compelled to say a little, at least something about it. I want more and more people to appreciate what has been given to us in the form of this Drama. A political, psychological, legal thriller that is bound to be memorable. Needless to say, Stranger has now become my utmost favorite Korean-drama I have ever watched. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT HESITATE TO WATCH THIS. I wanted to write an essay on this but I guess I'll stick to a precis, I hope my words were enough to impel you to start watching this.Lastly, be prepared to question morals, motives, ethics and torment your brain contemplating what will get thrown at you in the next episode, brace for heart-wrenching, nerve-racking moments, because this drama will, most certainly, take you on a ride, you won't forget. Enjoy!My rating: 9.5 out of 10."
tt6461346,"I have more than hope for all the best in the future for the writer of this drama! My favorite was Bae Doona, but that is a personal reference, all of the acting cast did splendidly, they delivered their roles magnificently and the script was majestic! I watch at least 3 k-dramas per month, and this is... one of the best, if not the best drama I've seen so far! I kept wondering throughout the series if the script was made by a Korean person, because it lacks all of the washed out clichés, the story is excellently thought through, characters are deep and the point itself explores the corruption, and the bad deeds done by very influential people who occupy high places within a country. Forest of Secrets set a new bar for dramas, and I really hope we'll get the chance to see something else from the author soon!"
tt6461346,"After watching Parasite, i had this thing to watch a Korean Tv series and guess what. I'm hooked to this one. It is really amazing, fan of breaking bad, the wire, better call saul, Mindhunter, True directives and many more like that will be hooked to this. Trust it's hidden gem on internet. The cinematography, acting, screenplay everything is amazing. I'm really happy that I'm getting to know Korean culture little little from this movie and series."
tt6461346,"I used to watch lots of crime thrillers. But I assure you this one by far one of the best I have seen. Most of the directors of crime thrillers will underestimate the viewers capacity and irritate us with their screenplay. The director of series didn't made that mistake. Till the very end, we could not able to guess the murderer or the motive behind it. Acting is outstanding. Hats off to the entire team for such brilliant production."
tt6461346,"Season 2 was a complete different show, didn't like 1 bit. On the other hand season 1 was amazing worth the watch will give s1 a solid 9 but season was just too boring 4/10."
tt6461346,"The story and characters were absolutely amazing!!! Shi Mok Hwang and Yeo Jin Han have soon become among my favourite characters ever and I already miss them. I really hope there will be a follow up of their story. The series is a great chance to understand Korean culture and it can compete with the best series around the world. The whole plot and reconstruction is very realistic and all the cast is superb, all characters very detailed and true, it's one of the best series/movie I ever seen. It gives addiction! I look forward Shi Mok to come back to Seoul and to lieutenant Han!"
tt6461346,"I gave this a chance after seeing the rating and because Doona Bae was the best part of Sense8. It is entertaining, at least in part, due to the insight into Korean culture and deference to authority as seen in the interactions between ranks and in particular the news conferences which would have the presenter laughed off the podium in most western countries.The BIG problem with this series is the subtitling - Sometimes you have just microseconds to read before it's gone."
tt6461346,"It is an overdramatised soap opera, where the boring pace is supposed to create tension (it does not). This Korean Sherlock wannabe is just simply annoying who is supposed to be extra-super brilliant but in reality things just are keep moving in a truly convenient way for him. I cannot even make it until the end of the 'masterpiece' season one, but after reading so many reviews hailing this extra budget soap opera, just felt the need to write. How on earth can you praise acting when all the characters show their true faces in their very first scenes? And the great plot, oh my... just so many dumb 'twists' that felt embarrassing to watch. I am probably just not open to such stories, but overdoing while oversimplifying does not make a serie drama. The directing is especially horrible for me. In case the serie is shorter by half, may have been a decent sow, but the writer and the director wanted to make it epic that so much it smells sweat. Expected so much more from this"
tt6461346,"First of all, I loved the background music - its gripping. It a very well written and executed how, with good story line and acting. You wont know anything until the very end, and keep doubting every character. Its a decently paced show, and you wont find one boring moment - amidst all revelations, blame games and well, causalities! Also gives you a sneakk peak into the power game in South Korea. Give it a try if you like suspense thrillers. You wont be disappointed!"
tt6461346,"The poster of this show caught my eye on Netflix as it had Doona Bae in it. Excellent story-telling techniques combined with the background score makes it a must-watch show, even if you do not understand the language (Netflix has excellent subtitles for this).The plot is intriguing and unpredictable. The only other show I've watched which is comparable to this one is Death Note, which was an anime."
tt6461346,"I think I have a pretty healthy detachment from the fiction I enjoy, but now that I've watched all 16 hours of ""Stranger,"" I'm experiencing separation depression! This tightly constructed drama was so much better than any of the usual American police procedurals, that I couldn't stop watching. Doona Bae's Lieutenant Han is a model of the wise woman professional in a career dominated by knuckleheaded males, but not so cliche since many of the male characters were portrayed as comfortable with her authority and respectful of her superior sleuthing. Seung-Woo Cho's junior prosecutor has a fascinating mental quirk that Cho plays with subtlety. You can't help but sympathize with him even when he's at his least empathetic. The unbelievable becomes believable as the motives and methods behind the crimes are revealed, and the overarching theme of pervasive corruption in democratic capitalist society is relatable to an American audience. It's going to be a while before I get over the end of this series, but there was a suggestion in episode 15 of Seung-Woo Cho's character getting a 10-month assignment in the USA, travelling from state to state. That's a series I really want to see, provided the writers of Stranger make the trip with him."
tt6461346,"I just finished watching part 2 . This whole series was just fantastic. I so hope that they just keep making more . The actors & actresses are superb , the scripts are so well written , the directors & producers did a fantastic job . I rewatched the 1st season when season 2 came out on Netflix , & now I just finished the 2nd . I enjoyed it so much , & being someone who doesn't speak any asian languages at all it was a bit difficult for me to keep track of who was who when they were talking about someone I couldn't remember the face that went with the name ... lol ... sooo even so I getting ready to rewatch the whole 2 seasons again . lol It was just that great . I hope whomever is contemplating watching it , will . Please do a season 3 😊"
tt6461346,"A deeply layered crime procedural in the K-drama style. Hwang Shi-mok is a brilliant but emotionally crippled prosecutor in the Western Seoul District. A gangster is murdered then the trail starts to lead to joy girls and higher ups, maybe his boss, co-workers, the cops, government officials? Everyone has a story or two and could be a suspect, slowly, too slowly but K-Drama right? the evidence is uncovered, corruption goes high. Some twists and turns, a cliffhager of sorts each episode; a lot of short convos in office settings, similar to the Joseon era costume dramas. Similar to the palace roman-a-clefs these stories need a schemer; full of furtive looks, quick excuses and plotting. Joon-hyeok Lee gets the thankless task here as Seo Dong-Jae; his character becomes more than wearisome by Ep 8, all ""drats foiled again"" facial tics. The rest are fine pros also, Seung-woo Cho as the lead has to play it straight, Doona Bae is a perky cop."
tt6461346,"So just saw S2E216 and what can I say...the suspense was until the end and the supporting cast once again came toe-to-toe with the leads. Rarely can a show master that and still let you know who the leads are. I am really left speechless bc it managed to conjure humors, hubris, mystery, unrequited love (well we shall see), loyalty, and just so many other things. But the true beauty of this show is that EACH episode is packed nicely. Everything seen and heard is necessary so you do t get bogged down with 'the meaningless'. Please make a season 3 and 4 ...have to pause couple times to catch the names bc it's in Korean and subtitles swing by a bit fast (Netflix) but what a show. Love the leads and supporting cast is as superb. Not as contrived as Scandinavian mysteries or brutal just a good series to watch..."
tt6461346,"Don't trust the reviews claiming it's ""fast-paced"". Yes, most of the scenes are, but some of the scenes are completely useless too (I love crime/mystery movies and tv shows as well as slow paced Asian movies). But what makes a good storytelling is that every scene counts and add a value to the story. Each episode is 1 hour long, it could have been 40 minutes with a brillant film making and film direction/storyboard. Also, the drama aspect is over present in a bad fashioned style to me.
Also, Netflix translations are... pretty basic and sometimes lead to think that the characters are a bit dumb...
All in all, it's a good TV show, but with too many stylish intent and overdoing the drama bit, guess it's the usual Korean way nowadays."
tt6461346,"Slow and tedious storyline with minimal character development and pretentious plotline keeps this in familiar K drama territory. The characters try to present themselves as more smart than the writing allows them to be and plot complexities are self fulfilling and ultimately amount to nothing. The male lead is a stoic character, very much in fashion in K Dramas, and the female lead (an actress of some international recognition) comes as an automaton instead of a strong female character. Ultimately nothing much happens and the ending leaves the viewer wary. Season 2 is more of the same with a little bit more product placements and equally unsatisfying. Long sections of episodes can be fast forwarded (recommended) and will take nothing away from the overall experience. Dialogues are rudimentary and amateurish for the subject matter. At the conclusion, there is no understanding of why the characters do what they do and frankly one doesn't care either."
tt6461346,This is the first time that I've seen a Korean tv-Serie which was a great and memorable crime drama.It's about a prosecutor and a policewoman who work together to bring the truth of those with wealth and power into the light.The script was well written. The cast is very good. The emotionless main character was performed by Cho Seung-Woo as a prosecutor who is a very talented actor. Doona Bae suits her role perfect as a policewomen.
tt6461346,"Wow! This show was a wild ride from start to finish. Fantastic leads and a compelling, gripping story make this an amazing show for anyone who loves a good thriller and mystery."
tt6905542,"After really enjoying season one and eagerly awaiting its return , the series has been cancelled .
An unexpected and shocking decision that leaves me behind in disbelief ."
tt6905542,"I wasn't sure at first, but it does grow on you, with some very subtle and brilliant humour towards the end. I am writing this review mainly to pay homage to SIMON PEGG'S voicing of the Chamberlain. This has to be one of the best voice artist works in TV history, its hard to tell it is even Simon Pegg, but the accents and inflections are quite simply superb, and you can tell he enjoyed every minute of it!"
tt6905542,"To start the negative reviews are by people who obviously didn't see the movie, don't appreciate old school puppetry of Jim Henson and more likely skeksis. This is my childhood and even though now I'm in my 30s I'm still just as creeped out by the skeksis and their voices. The puppeteers are awesome and gives a true throwback and keeps Jim Henson very much alive for the show. I love it."
tt6905542,"Why aren't more fantasy movies/series like this? It's unique, beautiful, moving and enthralling... It's evident that so much effort and attention to detail has been put into every little thing; the costumes, the sets, the voice acting. I am so glad one of my favourite childhood movies has been brought back and I hope the younger generation will learn to appreciate it as well.
Not everything is better with tons of CGI. Brian Froud and Jim Henson are a fantastic duo."
tt6905542,"I've been looking forward to this tv-series for a long time, and the wait was well rewarded. As a big fan of the original 1982 movie I was wondering if the series could live up to my expectations. The short answer is YES, and then some! I have watched the first episode with awe!The production looks gorgeous, the puppets look very much like the originals, but with much more diversity. The puppeteering has been brought to the next level, as the movements are a bit more realistic. Very well done!But the most important aspect is of course always the story. In my opinion they have succeeded in making an interesting prequel, slowly progressing toward the situation at the beginning of the movie.If you like the original movie, you will certainly love this series!"
tt6905542,WHYyYyyYyYy!!!!!! THIS IS SOoOoOoO gOOD!!!! I love this show so much and Netflix had the audacity to cancel this!!!!! ON A CLIFFF HANGER!!!!!!!! Grrrrrrrr!!! Batwoman got another season and that stuff is trash and people don't even like it!!!! And now outer banks got another season and that was just painful to watch!!! Terrible!!! Netflix needs to get their act together!!! In the bin of shows cancelled too soon like agent Carter and firefly and Jessica jones. GRRRRRRRRR!!!!!! EVIL NETFLIX!!!! EVIL!!!!REVIIIIVEEE!!!!!!!
tt6905542,"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance is more family-friendly and has a general sheen of class that might make it more appealing to a wider audience. It's absolutely gorgeous, with delightfully physical puppets giving a weight and realism to the colorful fantasy imagery. Some viewers might be put off by the fact it's acted out by puppets, but they'd be missing out. Age of Resistance is a compelling and powerful story packed with relatable characters.A prequel to the 1982 cult film The Dark Crystal, this Netflix TV adaptation expands on legendary director Jim Henson's vision. The 10-episode fantasy drama focuses on the world of Thra, which was first established in the original movie. Gelflings, who are elf-like creatures, are the sentient species living in the land of Thra. The Netflix series chronicles the lives of three young Gelflings who embark on an adventure after birthing a rebellion against Skeksis, the cruel emperor of Thra. After learning the horrifying truth behind Skeksis's powers, the trio decide to save their world from his oppressive dominion.A wholly magical and immersive experience, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance knows exactly where it's going and how it needs to get there. It is truly an enchanting and immersive visual and narrative experience unlike any other. The series also proves beauty can exist within a fully-realized world. Filled with gorgeous cinematography, carefully-crafted narratives, and memorable performances, this Netflix series is easily one of the most original and adventurous shows of 2019."
tt6905542,"When I first heard that a prequel of Dark Crystal was in production, I must admit, I was a bit skeptical. What about the original magic that was used by the late Jim Henson and his team. Will they focus more on what the current young folks want, nowadays (aka hyperactive action scenes and overkill of CGI). Well, thank God they did not. They respected the work of Jim Henson and if he were alive today, he would be proud as hell of what has been created. So glad to get a full background on the world and the people in the dark crystal universe. Perfect voice casting and last but use of the nostalgic puppets, we all learned to love. One worry I do have. Since this is a prequel to the movie, I wonder how much seasons they can produce before they reach the point where the story of the movie starts. I hope we do get a few seasons extra of this majistic master piece. A wel deserved 10!"
tt6905542,"This is an amazing series, creative and true to its origins! That is all!!"
tt6905542,"Beautiful. A masterpiece. Jim would be so proud.
A must watch for anyone looking for the next fantasy masterwork."
tt6905542,"I did not see the original movie from the 80's before I was socked into this universe, but I was instantly in love with its beauty. Maybe its not a 10/10, but I love Netflix for making something so original and magical for once. This is a nice combo with stranger things for me. Both series are 10/10 entertainment. Well done Netflix."
tt6905542,"So well done. I thought it was going to be a full CG over production of a classic, I was so wrong. Some younger viewers might be off put by the earlier puppetry style characters growing up in this computer generation age, but not this guy! The characters were true to the original, yet used modern technology to enhance the background and scenery. I think this production was created by people who are true fans of the original motion picture. In my opinion Mr. Henson would be extremely proud."
tt6905542,"I was too scared to watch the original movie as a child, and I still haven't watched it...I plan to soon...so for the purpose of this review I'll have to keep it at the series and not compare it to the movie.
The world is beautiful, the puppetry is amazing....I'm shocked at other reviews that have said the puppets are too frozen...I suggest they watch the behind the scenes doco also on Netflix to see how it was all done. I don't think you could physically get any more movement in the faces.
I think it's wonderful that this concept has been brought back and I hope another series is greenlit.
I do think there are too many episodes for the story...I am not a fan of the story process as described by the writers...I know that's the way a lot of television is written these days but I find this leads to things not flowing or making sense...the story just becomes a way to get from a to b. (Rather than a story that has been fully planned out as it were)
On a final note, I found elements of the story to be terrifying and heart wrenching..not going to say any more than that...I'm not sure how another reviewer could say it wasn't dark enough...
Like I said...I found elements to be very dark! I would not show this to young children.
Now to watch the original movie!"
tt6905542,"I can understand how many could give this high ratings. From the first episode one is awed by the degree of creative design, use of CGI and imagination in this series.Unfortunately, that's all it's got. The worst flaw of the series is blowing the basic premises of the movie out of the water-- concepts that were essential to the Dark Crystal story. If one never saw the movie that probably wouldn't bother... but who hasn't seen the movie. This is like saying that Superman never came from Krypton or Spider-Man wasn't bitten by a radioactive spider or James Kirk never met Spock. The major plot change blows the whole concept of the show right from the start. Simply a bad plot decision that immediately alienates many Dark Crystal fans.Then there's the yaaaawwwwn ""story"". Twenty minutes into the first episode I was bored (and that's not easy to do, as I love artistic fantasy / scifi-- and this has lots of artistry). But this series carries none of the charm, fascination, or personality of the original movie. It's just droll. Not to mention that constant snot goobers coming out of the nose pustules of one of the main characters is just repeatedly gross.One matter that bothered me (and many other reviewers): The puppets themselves. Were the Gelfling faces made of flat plastic sheets? Seriously, they had none of the look, charm and beauty of the original Gelflings. In truth, they looked pretty much like paper mache puppets. Not near the quality of the originals.Beauty, style and CGI does not a series make. Story, character and heart is the soul of the film. So I can only give it a 5-star ""mediocre"" rating. I've said it before: start with a good plot and story. The focus isn't on the landscape and CGI: it should be about the characters and intriguing plot. Other shows and local plays can do this with a one-room setting. Surely a series with the finances behind this one could do far better."
tt6905542,Oh wow - this magnificent Netflix series tells the prequel of The Dark Crystal. It's visually magnificent and extremely dark and disturbing. The Skeksis made their long awaited return to the screen and it does not disappoint. They are pure evil. If you are a fan of the original - like I am - you will love this show. If you have never seen The Dark Crystal - start now. Thank goodness we get a show that has great puppetry and creativity.
tt6905542,"Ummm ok so never seen any of this before, didn't have a clue what the 'The Dark Crystal' was but Elementary has now finished so needed something to watch and this popped up. Watched one episode and was hooked. Sooooo good. Now on episode 7. Watch it!!!!"
tt6905542,"These are dark times for those looking for stories that make them dream,
thankfully, combining old and new style, ""The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance"" leads us to dream again.
Recommended but not for closed minds"
tt6905542,"Wonderful retelling of a cult classic through the use of puppetry and modern day cgi. It's simply magical, the voice acting superb, each episode adding to and building on the fascinating world that Jim Henson created.
As a child I loved the original and for once it seems like the production team have paid attention to the original source material. Thank you for not ruining another childhood memory.
Strongly recommend this show. There's nothing else like it!"
tt6905542,"I'm a fan of the original Dark Crystal, but it has plenty of flaws. Netflix has taken that crazy, 80s, puppet movie and updated it, polished it, and given it a heck of a lot more depth. This series has dialed up the story and the lore to 11. The music is powerful, there is emotional story telling, and wonderful lessons if you're looking. This is a fantasy epic in the same vein as Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones, but it is so different from both of them, and not in a bad way. If you enjoy fantasy, if you enjoyed the old Dark Crystal movies, if you enjoy set design and special effects, if you enjoy epics that are larger than life-you will enjoy this movie. I'm just a random guy on the Internet, but I strongly recommend it."
tt6905542,"On a planet a handful of Gelflings begin a rebellion against the Skeksis when they discover a terrifying secret behind their power that threatens all of their world.This series prequel to the 1982 movie is admirably inventive and has all the visual splendour of the film while expanding on Jim Henson's original vision.These well directed episodes have the same intense feel only with more action and deep colours. There is something underlying menacing which stirs emotions like its predecessor. And just like Dark Crystal, Age of Resistance may be a little too creepy for children (and some adults too!). It also has the charm of the recent J. R. R. Tolkien adaptations only with puppets.
Sigourney Weaver narrates and it features the talents of Taron Egerton, Anya Taylor-Joy, Nathalie Emmanuel, Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill,Jason Isaacs to name a few. Even though the voices of the original characters are not consistently spot on they're good enough not to distract too much and that's really as negative as it gets.As with the best screen fantasies it has a dreamlike atmosphere and once the characters are established it moves at a brisk pace breaking new ground, introducing new places, creatures and characters not see before in the world Thra.The advancements in technology mixed with traditional puppets is breathtakingly groundbreaking. Excellent viewing, highly recommend."
tt6905542,"So many reviews talked about the liberties taken from the original. This sets up the original movie. And it is a much different world. My biggest issue is that this is very violent for younger viewers. I'm going to have to go back and watch the original now. I don't remember so much torture and one of the slaves gets bludgeoned to death with blood splattering on the other animals in cages. Artistic work into the environment and creature creation is amazing. Some CGI is very noticeable. Script is annoying at times. Cliches about misunderstandings are present. I'm not a professional reviewer, so give it a watch! It was worth the binge."
tt6905542,"Im absolutely loving Netflix right now, great flash of nostalgia, What a fantastic cast and wow the production! Pure amazing magic"
tt6905542,"So this is basically a tale set in the world cloned from Krull, the villians are pretty much Nanny Fine and Cicero of Skyrim voiced in the speech patterns of Jar Jar Binks, and moves about the pace in the first episode of Pan's Labyrinth. The combination of the cinematography is not the clear etched CGI we have gotten used to and it shouldn't be. This is old school film making with a blend of modern and well done puppetry. As the story goes, I'm hooked. Think more Tad Williams progression versus Brandon Sanderson, but you are in for a good time regardless.
Younger kids may have a harder time following whats going on."
tt6905542,"On paper, this seems like something I'd really love...an epic, sci-fi, fantasy tale with some great world building, a cool mythology, great voice acting, practical effects, and puppets.I don't wanna besmirch all the hard work that went into this...it's hugely impressive.But for some reason, I just don't care. Honestly, the puppets are just lacking for me....in return of the Jedi for example, we had such amazing puppet work, but without having some human faces with emotion for contrast, this show is really hard to connect with. The characters are slow and wooden, because they're made of wood.I remember trying to rewatch the old one and I thought the same thing...its all so slow and lifeless, and a bit indulgent...just because something takes tons of effort doesn't mean its going to connect...and trust me, I'm a lifelong muppet and puppet fan...but I feel like Kermit's performer could give me more emotion scrunching up his hand than all the Dark Crystal Characters in an hour long TV show. I'm crushed."
tt5743796,"**First off, disregard the few very low scores and comments. I read them all and they were basically all trolling comments and ratings **
That said, the show wasn't perfect in the first few scenes but it really pulled itself together and shaped up really well to end (2 seasons so far) with a strong ending and interesting cliffhangers! The 1st episode of season 1 was so so but every subsequent episode just got better and better! A very interesting story that comes from true history and needs more attention (especially now, when all the whitewashed chapters of our history are finally being told and told truthfully) & a really sharp martial arts action series. Unlike Into The Badlands which I couldn't get into because the choreography (although stunning) was unbelievable and the storyline was uninteresting, Warrior has way better writing and action that is more realistic (of course some is over the top but that's lthe point when it focuses on Ah-Sahms fights. He personifies Bruce Lee's larger than like persona) in many cases.
I'm really glad I found this series. I binged it all in 2 days. I'm eagerly awaiting and hoping that although Cinemax is no longer renewing its shows that HBO max which absorbed the properties renews this one as was promised and as many many fans are awaiting. I can't see why they wouldn't.
Can't recommend Warrior enough to martial arts & historical piece (the sets and costumes are excellent and fit the late 1800's perfectly!) lovers! 9/10!"
tt5743796,"Back in the day where Chinese immigrants arrived in San Francisco , U.S.A, a lone wolf came with serious fighting skills.
So far, I like what I see. I'm going to watch it with enthusiasm. Check it out."
tt5743796,I just finished the second episode and I am hooked. The characters are all very interesting. The main character is quite likable and all the role players are strong. The production value is great. The action is exciting. There isn't anything about this show that annoys me. It's very stylistic and pushes the story forward with a good brisk pace. The women on this show are HOT and it kinda makes me wish I lived in this world. PS - I've never been a big fan of martial arts stories but this show makes me want to watch a lot more of them.
tt5743796,"Warrior is one of the best and most underrated shows of the last decade. It's hard for me to even describe how much I love this show. Everything from the acting to the writing to the production is fantastic! All you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is. A lot of fans were worried when Cinemax announced they won't be making shows anymore but fortunately for us fans HBO Max picked it and season three is right around the corner. It was so deserving of another season, hopefully with HBO Max's platform and the great word of mouth that the fan base will continue to grow. I can't wait to see more of this incredible show!"
tt5743796,"Warrior is a flat out awesome show that really does deserves a lot more attention than it's been getting as it's one of the better shows on right now! For some reason Cinemax hasn't done a very good job promoting this series (or any of their series really) but people are finally starting to figure out how good this show really is through word of mouth! It's just an awesome, action packed thriller with a great story, great acting and even better fight scenes! Give it a chance, I promise you won't be disappointed!"
tt5743796,"One of the best shows I've ever seen. The story, the setting, the history, the characters, the cinematography, the ACTION...just...WOW! Everything is amazing, and it just gets better and better as the series moves along. The buildup is something else, and the second to last episode of season 2 needs to be seen to be believed! They BETTER not cancel this, and give us a third season! The story is still unresolved. In any case, go watch this right now if you haven't already!"
tt5743796,"The most underrated show. Good story, fantastic action, great acting and ultimate characters. Loved the show."
tt5743796,This series is really promising. It has all the ingredients to be as good as Banshee or Peaky Blinders. The mixture of both worlds made this series born. Hopefully it will become a masterpiece.
tt5743796,"The most underrated series out there that I got to know while looking at and reading some list of renewed shows! Can you imagine that?!A blend of awesome 19th century SF screenplay & storylines, ultra-superb acting with deep intensity, amazing development, meticulous attention to details and a completely enthralling score makes this series like the GoT of the 19th century, with one exception and that is all its episodes are stellar. 20 shiny episodes for the pleasure of our eyes and music to our ears.(+) Amazing screenplay, storylines and plots, the size of ten skyscrapers and the shininess of diamonds.(+) Superb acting by who? Everybody!, especially shiny are Ah Sahm, Li Yong, Ah Toy, Mai Ling, Wang Chao, Young Jun, Bill O'Hara, Dylan Leary, Penelope Blake, Walter Buckley among others. Please know, I wanted to line-up the whole cast, so you get the real picture; that's how good, worthy and stellar they are.(+) Award-winning development in all episodes, very few seen and encountered at such a high level.(+) Enthralling, 3D, multi-faceted score, well fitted with every scene, accompanying fights and emotions alike.Every time I see Mai Ling, I'm mesmerized by the beauty, soft voice and ultra-charismatic aura of this woman. She's the show's female character so dear to my heart. Dianne Doan is hugely talented and the character of Mai ling fits her like a glove.Warrior doesn't shy away from nothing, shows everything with deep pictures and caressing brutality and from those comes its force, shaking us like ""des fétus de paille"". We are nothing but straws going left and right by Warrior's gusts of wind.That's how awesome this show is and I'm sure that its success will grow larger and larger until all relevant humans on earth are aware of it. I'm enthusiastic about it and believe in it.If you are to bow to this show, ""Bow Low""..."
tt5743796,"It's a wild ride, no doubt about it. Right off the bat, one needs to set aside historical accuracy and just enjoy the plentiful ass-kicking and the epic journey that our man Ah Sahm embarks upon. But while truthfulness may not be at the forefront of this series, there are still enough true historical elements to make it all the more interesting.The different angles from which the events are observed make for an intriguing odyssey that doesn't always offer a clear side to root for. After all, these are people fighting to either gain supremacy among criminal organizations, or abuse their way to the political top. But even if the motives that drive the narrative are oftentime morally questionable, the show nonetheless succeed at its most important task: to entertain. Thanks in no small part to the beautifully coreographed and occasionally ferocious fight scenes."
tt5743796,This show is absolutely epic! I've been waiting for years for a realistic martial arts series that had some historical backdrop. The acting is superb and the fight sequences are top notch. I would highly recommend anyone interested in a period martial arts series
tt5743796,"Some of the acting feels a little shaky in initial episodes, but once it gets rolling the show is engaging. There are likeable characters, people to root for. The racial dynamics are pretty much what was going on in San Francisco in the 1800s, so there was no need to exaggerate.
The writers do a good job of showing the full spectrum of human behavior; not all of the white guys are evil, not all of the Asians are good.Hoon Lee, the guy who plays Wang Chao, stands out as a great actor. Something magnetic about that dude."
tt5743796,"I just discovered this show today and watched 10 straight episodes on HBO Max. It's epic and amazing. I think this show will be as big as Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Walking Dead, etc. It's so unique but I'll try to explain. It feels like Gangs of New York set in San Francisco during the Gold Rush, with political machinations , epic fights, and some nudity. Not kid appropriate. I really feel like Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones fans will love this show. I also heard it's developed from notes written by Bruce Lee 50 years ago which is a cool tidbit. Incredible show. HBO Max has a winner here."
tt5743796,"Bruce Lee said ""The key to immortality is first living a life worth remembering."" This is not it.What we do have is a protagonist who drops the f-bomb every other word, bullies the elderly, murders at will, and beats everyone else up to a bloody pulp.As others have pointed out, the high ratings for this mess of humanity it mind-boggling. The entire cast use language, colluiqoalisms and mannerisms that are right out of 2020. Gone are the gentle manners of both men and women in the late 19th Century.The Chinese are portrayed as whimpish, subservient rabble, enslaved by other Chinese. The Irish are loud, drunk and always beating on women and police.Everyone is crooked.The writers even managed to make a grotesques and vile joke about Catholics Nuns in the very first episode.And did we mention the prostitutes? There are prostitutes everywhere! All supermodels, of course, with perfectly styled hair, modem make up and laser hair removal.The only saving grace are the costumes and the fight choreography - the rest of the show - the music, sounds, lighting, shots, cinematography, acting, dialog; mindless idiocy.Master Lee also said: ""Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. ""This crime against humanity is anything but water."
tt5743796,"Three minutes into this show and I was ALL IN! It has everything I want in a show.
I felt like Cinemax should've knocked on my door and said, ""YO CHECK THIS OUT""!
I see many negative reviews on here. I'm guessing those to be written by people that like musicals or boring artsy films. If you like crime and action movies? Then you'll say F@#$ YEAH! If you don't? Go watch La La Land, The Artist, or Eat Pray Love. You know films that should make a man contemplate committing seppuku rather than sit through."
tt5743796,Not quite sure why a few have given it bad reviews I thought it was brilliant good storyline with a good backdrop its merged modern film but still has the perfect slice of old school martial arts film. Acting is great people giving it bad reviews must of never seen a decent old school martial arts film I personally think this style of filming old school/new school mix is the key to keeping the original martial arts style films alive. If you are a youngster giving it bad reviews on the martial arts acting style then you are wrong go back and watch a classic then come back and review. This is the perfect blend and the future of classic martial arts films cant wait for more episodes
tt5743796,"Couldn't find anyting to watch, so i thought hmm, I mean, i like material arts movies and Jackie Chan/Bruce Lee and gave it a go. And man I was blowned away, so fricking good, action and fight scenes in the approximately 1870s, I totally love it! Highest score! 🇺🇲"
tt5743796,A show that's not the same reality garbage that every channel now seems to have. The story is great and they haven't even really finished with it yet. The action is fun and realistic (most of the time) and the acting is better then you would think. I really like to this show
tt5743796,No spoilers here!I think this is even better than The game of thrones. And I did love the game of thrones. And Warrior is of course way different serie. But same way in both series I love the characters and anything can happen in the serie. Lot of surprises!Great adventure!There is a great writing on characters. There is drama humor thriller and great action scenes and great acting by each character.It's just sad that the marketing an hype hasn't lifted up the serie to people's attention.Everyone who has watched this have loved it and hoped for serie to continue.I really think that someone should and hope that someone will take this to season four.It's a great piece of art and a wonderful story.
tt5743796,"If you're looking for an exhilarating TV series, ""Warrior"" is an absolute gem. From start to finish, I was utterly captivated by this show. The storyline is masterfully crafted, keeping you hooked like glue with its compelling narrative. Set in the gritty backdrop of 19th century San Francisco, the series delves into the brutal world of the Chinese immigrant community and the power struggles that ensue.What truly sets ""Warrior"" apart are the phenomenal actors and their performances. Each character is brought to life with such depth and authenticity, making you emotionally invested in their journeys. The fight scenes are a standout feature, choreographed with stunning realism and intensity. You can feel every punch and kick, adding to the raw energy of the show.I can't recommend ""Warrior"" enough. Whether you're a fan of gripping dramas, martial arts, or historical fiction, this series offers a perfect blend of everything. It's a hidden gem that deserves to be discovered and appreciated. Trust me, you'll be on the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. So, buckle up and get ready for an exhilarating ride with ""Warrior""!"
tt5743796,"In this day and age of rubbish reality shows. Warrior is so refreshing! The storyline is unique, the cast is sensational and the fight scenes are second to none!I could be more critical because they have added stuff that isn't necessary but overall it's a great show and very enjoyable.More people should watch!"
tt5743796,"I love this show. I was looking for something similar to Banshee and this fit the bill. The show is so fun to watch, we have enjoyed every minute of it. I cannot wait to get more!"
tt5743796,"This is a tough one. The show is entertaining to watch, but some aspects of it really dampen the overall experience. I know nothing about production/set design and have no idea if the sets used in this show are beyond average, but after a while, the Chinatown set; and most of the other locations/sets throughout the show; were repetitive and boring to look at. I think that really affected what was happening from an immersive and entertainment point of view. Because of that, I believe the atmosphere of the show grew dull very quickly.There's a decent amount of nudity and graphic violence, which is something to be expected from a show on Cinemax, probably. And I don't quite remember, but I think there was a sex scene or two in three episodes in a row, starting with the show's premiere. I don't really care about that, although it's understandable if that may annoy some people, and looking back on it, they were probably a little gratuitous. But the sex scenes were eased off after the first three episodes of the first season, I think.And the graphic violence in the show was fairly prominent, I guess. The only instances which particularly stood out that I remember were the fight sequence in the ninth episode of the first season and the ending of the fight sequence in the seventh episode of the second season with Ah Toy and Lai. Personally, I can't seem to remember all of the instances of nudity and graphic violence, and general violence. I must be desensitized to stuff like that, but those two things are present in this show, so if you haven't watched this show yet, know that there is some nudity, one too many sex scenes in the first few episodes of the show, and some graphic instances of violence.The cinematography is one of the better elements of the show - in the second season. The cinematography didn't really stick out to me that much in the first season. It wasn't bad. But for some reason, when I think back on the first season, all I can think about is that the quality of the general cinematography looked grainy. It wasn't exactly grainy, but that's the only descriptive word I can think of. That was only in the first scene of the series premiere. The rest of the cinematography after that throughout the first season was fairly decent and better in quality. But the second season is where it's at, cinematography-wise. The sixth episode was a work of beauty in that regard. There must've been a bigger budget, and the cinematographers were able to do a better job. As far as the second season is concerned, the cinematography is definitely one of the highlights.I think the best aspect of this show is the fight sequences and the choreography of them. They're grounded. They're gritty. And the actors do a good job at performing the fight choreography by Brett Chan, the fight coordinator. And that may also include Craig Macrae and Haiyang Zhang, two stunt coordinators. I don't know the difference between both professions. The only other show I've seen with fight choreography rivaling the fight choreography in this show is Into the Badlands. And while this is probably an unpopular opinion - personally, I liked the fight choreography in that show more. But that's not to say that the fight choreography in this show is bad.I've seen a lot of people bring up that this show is massively underrated. And, quite frankly, I don't really get it. I can understand the sentiment that it's not that popular, but a show would have to be very good for it to be considered underrated, depending on the amount of popularity it has. And I don't think this show is as great as people are saying. But I guess it's good enough to where it should be way more popular and more known.However, I do think this is a show worth watching. But perhaps not in the way most people would say. It's worth watching because of certain characters and the fight sequences. Some of the scores used were pretty nice, too. And the cinematography, too - in the second season, especially. But the story, the plotlines, and the plot threads aren't very engaging. The thing is, looking on the bright side, I'm the odd one of the bunch plenty of times, so I imagine most people who haven't watched this show will have a different outlook towards it and that they'll think it's one of the greatest shows to exist. So, it's likely that if you're someone who hasn't watched it yet, you'll absolutely love it. Personally, I wouldn't go as far as to say that I loved it, but it was entertaining. Sometimes, that has to be enough."
tt5743796,"Fight scenes are nice, but most of them are shot in the dark, so you are not able to see anything.
The idea of the series is good, but the way it was implemented is very bad. I do not know people think that a lot of profanity and nude scenes make a series better and more realistic. Also dialogues are really bad.
The producers tried to show how different cultures behave, but failed. The Chinese characters are more like Italian gangsters than Chinese.In summary - The series were promising, but failed to deliver."
tt7622902,"A series that reveals why the best of KDrama is loved worldwide. The writing, direction, and acting are a joy in a clever, intelligent, compassionate, and often hilarious prison story that surprises at every turn. Strongly recommended."
tt7622902,I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this series! I'm watching it for a second time. I fell in love with each character even the guards. Their stories captivate you and help you see them in a different light than at first. I highly recommend it!
tt7622902,"Amusing, funny and has a great characters.
I recommend to watch it."
tt7622902,"If you had told me five days ago that I would be this enthralled about a series revolving around a Korean professional baseball player on the brink of being signed by an American Major League team being sent to prison for assaulting a sexual predator, I would not have believed it. Yes, I am a Korean drama fan and knew this series was well received in Korea but had dragged my heels on watching it. Who knew that this series would be chockful of so many funny, heartbreaking, happy, sad and truly heart-tugging moments? Each of the main characters has a rich personality and you quickly find yourself emotionally wrapped up in their stories. Each episode is about an 1.5 hours long with 16 episodes so there was plenty of time to flesh out the stories and characters, whether the prisoners or their guards. Of course, we know it is far from what goes on in a real prison but the humanity and character depicted in this show leaves us with hope that we will look beyond the prison jumpsuit or the guard uniform to find the human inside. Watch it, you won't be disappointed!"
tt7622902,"Prison Playbook is a character-driven human comedy, warmly written and bolstered by stellar acting performances. The drama expertly navigates its audience through its spot on comedy as well as powerfully heartfelt moments. The drama succeeds in delving into the characters & the beautiful & melancholic storyline. Serene and hopeful, Prison Playbook is a magnificent drama."
tt7622902,"Wow what a drama it's the best Korean drama I've watched so far, well I loved LIVE too so they are both worth a look see. The actor who plays the druggy in this show was my favorite and I am sorry I don't his name now but trust me when you watch it you will know who I'm talking about he is so funny and sad but mostly funny the way he interacts with the other actors it's just pure gold. Ohh wow all the actors are brilliant really. I just think it's a binge worthy drama and I know you will love love love it! And if you don't well I'm sorry lol but you will"
tt7622902,"The storyline is interesting - slice of life with dark humor. The characters are well developed and the actors do a good job making you empathize with their stories. -Lee Gyoo-hyeong, who plays the addict, is brilliant...and the bromance between the main actors makes you love them even more. :)"
tt7622902,"It's on my top 5 Korean Drama all the time..
The story, characters, relationships, tense, love line all in perfect combination..
Everything just fall perfectly that you cannot even realise that 1.5hours already passed by..
Totally looking forward for the this drama team next project.."
tt7622902,"Quite unexpectedly this series turned out to be a very involving and meaningful series. Funny one scene and scary the next it is thoughtfully written and makes the viewer think about the choices one makes in life. Each episode is 90 minutes long so it's longer than the usual 16 episode series but it is rewarding because he characters are so interesting and if you concentrate and give this a chance you will empathize with them. It really makes the viewer feel for the criminals both wrongfully imprisoned and those who have just made wrong choices, wardens and correctional officers and families. The ensemble cast is memorable. Park Hae Soo stars as the main character a baseball player who goes to prison for going overboard defending his sister from a sexual assault. Early breakout role for Jung Hae In as a army captain framed for murder.
Usually I don't like prison shows but there is a lot more depth to the story than you would get from a Hollywood series. Very moving series about friendship and loyalty."
tt7622902,"Let me begin by saying this is not a bad show, as can be seen by all the rave reviews here.Most all of the actors do an amazing job portraying their characters. I especially liked the performance of Lt. Paeng who made me forget he was playing a role every time I saw him, and I was more than pleasantly surprised by Krystal who played the (ex) girlfirend. And the premise sounds great on paper.The show is dragging though. I see that somebody said ""there is no dull moment"" in this series...there are A LOT of dull moment in this show. There's so much over exposition in every movie length episode. When you just want the story of the baseball player's future to continue, you get another 10 minute flashback of a scene which doesn't really matter that much. I'd say this is the show with the most (unnecessary) flashbacks I have ever seen, and I've seen Lost.While the acting by most is great. I wasn't really feeling the almost Forrest Gump like performance by the main character. I know he's written as somebody who's ""not that smart"", but it just becomes jarring to see him react inhuman like most all the time. Basically it feels like you're watching somebody who can't act, and wether that's intentional or not.... I wasn't feeling it.Same with the 'humor'. Almost every episode you get what can't be called anything other than comedy sketches. Along with a weird sound effect to show you just witnessed something 'funny'. It falls flat every time. This along with the goofy prison director, and a prison mostly filled with honorable fanboys of the baseball player who either didn't do the crime or did it under 'just' pretenses, just throws out the realism from this show.People with a lot more patience will probably still enjoy the excellent acting shown through to the end and all the extra scenes one gets in every hour and a half of episodes. I also want to find out what happens with the baseball player, but there's just way too much filler. After 8 episodes of his story progressing at a snail's pace, I'm out."
tt7622902,I thought it was funny. Really got into the characters.
tt7622902,"I was taken aback when i read the description and started watching this drama because the plot and script was so refreshing. It is actually kind of a comedy drama in itself. This drama touches the themes of friendship,love,guilt,suffering,perseverance,motivation and bad habits which destroy a person. This drama was able to achieve displaying the many perspectives of the people in jail.
It mildly reminded me of the shawshank redemption."
tt7622902,"Prison settings are a common milieu for stories as we see multiple characters and easy to put them in conflict. This is a look into a medium security pen in Korea, not that bad a place; only mild violence and the guards are generally softies at heart, the Warden a fool like an old sit-com. Antagonists are generally dealt with quickly to avoid the K-drama ""drats, foiled again"" plotting. The hero is a stoic good man doing his time; his cellmates have their own stories, most are in jail through bad luck or bad bosses, will they survive? Oh and the boy/girl romantic part has to play out and these side stories dig deep into K-Drama playbook."
tt7622902,"I really don't understand the hype of this series.The main character is so boring. Great production, poor writing.The cast? No chemistry. Jus an overrated kdrama."
tt7622902,"I'm reviewing this cause there is only one review and this show needs more credit!The best about the series is it's comedy, it's like watching an anime of madhouse like One Punch Man.
At first I didn't think of the series that much, but you hooked pretty quickly and there no dull moments.This is the one show you can put on after a hard day of work when you don't want to stress yourself that you've got to keep absolute attention in case you miss a line.It's has a good story, some romance and enough laughter to get you through easily."
tt7622902,"I fond this drama while looking for the best ones in korea, and after episode 10 i have forgotten that its a drama and mistaken as a personal story, and aigooo completely forgotten that its 1hr 40min episode each. I think i need to join the fan party who says that this is a best korean drama so far."
tt7622902,"DESERVING OF A PERFECT SCORE.
This series will make you laugh while crying vice-versa. It may not depict the real horrible situations in prison (since it's made for TV) but somehow an eye-opener of the hardships of our inmates innocent or not. I wish there would be a season 2 but it's already perfect the way it is.
Kudos to all the cast and crew! Well-recommended. Haven't laughed like this since FIERY PRIEST! 🤗"
tt7622902,It started out boring but every episode is special.
tt7622902,"The series is a DIAMOND, it's a MASTERPIECE!!!It deserves more than 10 stars!!!Oscar performances by all the actors (one was better than the other, I could not even say who was the best or better than the other)!!!Great script with incredible messages!!!!This is how you set the example to others, with your integrity, even in an evil world!!!It belongs now to my personal TOP10 kdrama series!!!!Definitely must watch!!!!"
tt7622902,"Brilliantly written, heartwarmingly executed, amazing drama! Simply fantastic! If someone asks me to mention a perfect kdrama, I will happily introduce them to Prison Playbook!Each episode contained dark humour and great twists that I never predicted along with heartwarming messages. In each episode I laughed out loud and teared too. I loved all the characters. Every single one of them.So thankful for the drama team for this wonderful gift to us. Thank you!"
tt7622902,"I've picked up this drama because it was one of the popular ones and everyone had only praise to share about it. It did took me a while to finish it, mainly due to the episoded being more than one and a half hour long, when the standard length of a k drama episode is about forty minutes to an hour. The length, fortunately, didn't make it boring or tiring. Though the story was kind of odd at first, as I couldn't make sense of what was happening or why the lead character ended up in prison. Things got clearer after the first episode. The story itself is okay, without too many twists and just enough drama to keep it interesting. It doesn't surprise in containted but, if you love slice of life stories with the comedy element to lighten up the drama, this is a drama for you. Finally, the performances were really good by everyone and the soundtrack just perfect for this drama."
tt7622902,"The warmth of Korean drama. The plot is soothing but it can keep people from moving too fast. The male champion changed many people around him by being positive and upward. Several of the main characters are very vivid. Although the hero's aura is a little bigger in the plot, it is not too abusive, and the water flooding of love is also controlled in an acceptable range. But why is it that the whole character only eats instant noodles?"
tt7622902,"I watched this as my first KDrama tonight, the first episode and found it refreshing. Evenly paced, thoughtful with a sense of irony, I'm pleased I chose this as my introduction to Asian TV. This is character driven and the characters are relatable, even the less moral ones. A fine lead actor performance from Park Hae-soo saw him praised for his work and it's easy to see why. I will be watching the rest of the series now, and look forward to seeing how it develops!"
tt7622902,That's right probably worst prison movie or serie .I love prison movie when there is crime or sports taking place .but I found nothing no comedy no crime no sports att all .story was slow like he'll watching three episode was like I am watching for decades. I don't know what was Netflix thinking making tv series's like that .I could not bear to watch after 3 and half episode .Don't know what gave much ranking to this kind boring drama.
tt7078180,"I just wanted to leave a review because I almost finished watching this and I love it so much.I haven't watched anime for a few years now but boy, does this title deliver. It's sweet, supremely poignant, and most importantly, real and sincere. Basically most of the episodes consist of Violet going to someplace and writing a letter for someone. But the beautiful thing is, every story is real and unabashed. There's a lot of sadness and stuff that will make you cry but it's never manipulative or doesn't ever feel forced. It's authenthic and doesn't exist for any other purpose than to show that it does exist and that it can hurt or be beautiful, and most of the time both.Anyway, I am totally enamored with this series. The animation is also beautiful and the characters are all distinct and do not strictly comply to anime stereotypes (too much). My only complaint is that the main protagonist is a 14 y/o girl who managed to wreck entire armies of soldiers and somehow was some unstoppable killing machine despite being built like a stick figure. But since this anime I guess that's something that can be reasonably forgiven.My verdict: watch this series. It is truly incredible!"
tt7078180,"This is by far, in terms of an anime series especially, one of the most beautifully animated pieces i've ever seen. the colours, the animation, the rendering of landscapes, ugh, absolute eye candy. as for the plot, i'd say that two episodes in, i was getting quite frustrated by violet's barely-human nature, but i'm glad i stuck through! i'd definitely recommend this in general :))) but, i wish some characters were developed more, and that each person's story (violet's clients, i guess) wasn't just limited to each episode, because it did kind of feel like 'filler' in a way, or that they were meaningless (didn't have the most impact, at the end). i know that the show did establish a recurring theme of war but i think it wasn't enforced well enough to make all the episodes feel fully tied together? even violet's character could've been developed more during the first half. but that's just me nitpicking, this was still a beautiful anime if you stick through to the bitter end, super happy to have watched it :'>"
tt7078180,"Okey, I'll keep this review as brief and too the point as possible.
The animation is just stunning. This anime is just gorgeous with a capital G. 
Voice acting is perfectly chosen. Weather you're watching the sub or the dub it's great. If I had too point out one negative thing it's the fact that some people may find the first two or three episodes relative slow. But please do yourself a favor and keep watching. As soon as episode 3 or 4 the series starts too click.The story is a writers Magnus opus. The characters have convincing motivations, backstories etc. And then I'm not even talking about the events in the episodes themselves. From episode 6 to 13 it's one big cry-fest. The stories are so heartfelt and heartbreaking I had to cry at least a few times every episode. Anyone with their heart in the right spot would cry I think.EPISODE 10 is without a doubt one of the best things you'll have ever seen.Watch this now."
tt7078180,"Okay, here goes my 3rd review. Violet Evargarden is a young girl known as ""the weapon"" during the war, because of her insane skills at the battlefield. After the war is over, Violet starts working as an ""Auto Memories Doll"" in order to understand her commander´s last words. Dolls are hired by regular people in order to express in a letter their thoughts for someone, the best as posible. The episodes are focus on Violet´s job as a Doll, the things she learn from them, and the story behind her strange behaviour. I think that´s all i should say about the plot.My philosophy: you can always find something in an anime that you´ve never seen before, and for me that´s enough to make it a worthy watch (which is why i´d never tell anyone not to watch an anime). However, there are some things you need to know before you watch. This anime is not yet finished, but after the last episodes i think i´ve seen enough to make a worthy review.The animation is one of the bests out there. The colours and the amount of detail in every environment is a pleasure to watch. The soundtrack fits perfectly for the series. I wouldn´t say it´s an amazing soundtrack but it does its job quite well.The storyline is not very atractive itself, but it´s execution is flawless. The main theme in Violet is the character´s development (her development in specific), which i must say that considering this is a 13 episodes series, it felt very well acomplished along the way. Every episode brings something new and refreshing to the series and every outcome seems to have been thought in detail.This is a 10/10 for me. So far all i can see is a very well crafted anime. There is love and a lot of dedication on it. Definatelly a must watch."
tt7078180,"If you have already watched it you know what i am going to say and if not then go and watch it first. Artistic type Great visuals, lovely background sound and the main is the plot which is quite a different and that what makes it more beautiful.
 
Usually maximum audience love to watch those which have action,suspense ,story and a good antagonist. This series is nothing like that. Yes this series has Suspense that the main character Violet Evergarden is trying to figure out the emotion and Feelings that hold this world in her own way and thus that's the main suspense for us indeed. As the day are passing and the new episode of this series is getting a lot better. The pace of the series may be slow for some peoples.The thing which is keeping me to go on with this series is how the main character will discover herself who lacks to understand emotions. Every episode is taken as far as real life example(as per me) which make it so better.. I recommend people to watch this who like content which gives us advice to understand feelings and emotions - it would be spoilers if i try to say more about it though it would be better if you discover this anime by yourself.Animation -10Sound Editing - 9Background music - 10Story line - 9English Dubbing -9Emotions - 10overall i love it... that's why i rated it 10.."
tt7078180,"I have seen a lot of anime in my time, with a log of almost 2,000 anime movies or series that I have reviewed (elsewhere than IMDb), and have given very, very few above a 10 star rating. I was very surprised after seeing the trailer for Violet Evergarden as this turned out to be so much more than I expected. Every episode pulls at your heartstrings as it revels the pains of daily life and the ever so important words that we need to say to the ones most important to us while we still have the chance, and sometimes, when that chance is no longer an option. The animation visuals are truly amazing and do an excellent job of setting up both the intensity and/or gentleness of the moment, with a balanced mix between 2D and CG without ever making the mix obvious. I rate them a 10.The background score also does an excellent job between music and sometimes pure silence to allow the viewer to either be pulled along by the emotions of the score, or to be hushed and feel the impact of statement or a visual expression. I rate it also a 10.The overall story at times seems like it has been done before (which is hard to do these days when literally tens of thousands of anime titles have already been done), yet keeps it fresh with little twists that keep you tied to the main character. There are absolutely breathtaking moments with a sentence here or there literally yanks the emotions from your chest and helps you realize that even if this episode seems like something you've witnessed before, you haven't felt it quite like this. I rate it a 11.The character development at times seems weak for some of the side characters, many of whom appear to be typical anime clichés. However, at other times some of the minor characters feel more developed that then what you might consider to be the main cast to highlight a significant emotional draw needed for that part of the story. As for the main character, the steps you see her development from what she was to what she can become, are slow, painful and sometimes a bit overemphasized. The character flashbacks, though, help you realize the internal struggle she has, and why her inability to let go is so strong while she deals with understanding the emotions of others. I rate it a 9.5.If you are a fan of anime. This is a must see.If you are not a fan of anime, but enjoy series with strong dramatic appeal and a solid, engaging story, this is a must see.That said, be sure to have a box of tissues handy. You're going to need them."
tt7078180,"First of all what catch my attention instantly was the art of the anime, which is a masterpiece by itself. It is a pleasure without end to see such a gorgeous animation and my eyes sure thanks a lot. Since the first episode I could see that this anime would be worth my time. The way the history is presented to us and the way it develops itself is magnificent, it helds a feeling of mystery and sadness all the time, and it doens't fail to make you wish for more. The characters are well contructed and well explored too. This masterpiece is definitly going to my favourite animes list.After finishing it - 04/06/2018.The way the history devoloped trough the episodes was amazing, the story is touching and perfect, the end was perfect, it leaves itself open to interpretations and is not cliche. I loved it in every way, 10 out of 10 without doubt, It is now one of my favourites animes of all time."
tt7078180,"Violet Evergarden is all about self discovery and learning to adapt in a new way of life which is very strange to what you're used to.STORY/PLOT
The story revolves around Violet Evergarden, a young girl around the age of 14 who was orphaned at a young age and taken into the military to be trained and used as a weapon in the war. She basically became ""militarised"" in her personality and attitude and became very emotionless because of this.
The only person she really knew and had feelings for (whether she knew this herself or not) was her major (Gilbert). 
The war is now over and she wakes in a hospital healed from the last battle, Violet Evergarden remembers the last thing Gilbert said to her but doesn't understand what it meant due to her personality and attitude of being in the military all her life and used as a weapon.
She now has to find a new job while also finding out where Gilbert is and what he meant. So she becomes an auto memory doll. These write letters for clients that are unable to write themselves, so the dolls listen to what they want to say and write it down in a professional way for their client. Violet Evergarden starts learning about different types of emotions through this process like love and grief through listening to people's stories and seeing thier emotions of how they react when saying what they want written down in their letters. She ultimately starts getting closer to learning what her Majors last words was to her.This anime is purely story and character based it's all about character building and the emotional journey of a young girl (and it really is emotional at times and gets the feels going) there's very very minimal action so don't go expecting massive fight scenes because it isn't about that. The animation and drawings are incredible while the soundtrack is also perfect for this story and is beautifully done to get your emotions going with this story. It left me wanting to watch more and more after each episode which is always a good sign of a well done anime.
I can honestly say it's one of my favourite anime's.Music 10/10
Visuals 10/10
Acting 10/10
Overall 10/10"
tt7078180,"Animation - 10
Story - 10

Background Score - 10One fine anime which stucks in your head and hits you right in the feels. Watch it if you still haven't."
tt7078180,"I watched this show purely because I wanted to see why people love this show so much. The world building was lacking. They never explained anything regarding why the war started or motivations behind it. Been centered that much on the war I would expect some type of history about how it started in the first place. They never explain much about Violet. I'd like to ask how was this girl allowed to join the military in the first place? Why was she so strong and special and why she didn't understand any emotions?? The inability to understand her character made me not care for her.Story: 6/10
Characters: 5/10
Music: 8/10
Animation 9/10
Total: 7/10I don't think this show deserves the hype is got but to each their own."
tt7078180,"It's a known problem of long running tv shows, especially with anime series where each episode usually have their own storyline and then the ""main story"" gets pulled forward only here and there. At some point you realize you learn how about 80% of the episodes will be; the story line gets repeated, only with slight changes with the previous episodes (different setting etc).I wouldn't had expected to face this problem with Violet Evergarden with only 14 episodes. It doesn't take long to see how each episode work; There's a problem, Violet dives in and solves it, and learns something about herself. And then all over again in the next episode.As the main story has an interesting feel, it's not enough to bring it up only here and there. Instead we get to see Violet fulfilling her task and oh, another episode has gone by and lesson learned.It's specially frustrating to see such lazy writing and yet look at the amazing animation with awe. Sure, the main story sometimes pulled my heart strings, but it didn't do it genuinely. This show had a ""tear jerker"" written all over it, and that's exactly what it is. But I would've LOVED to feel strong emotions WITH a unique storyline, not only with stock feelz crap.So storyline gets about 3/10, animation 10/10, and characters 4/10 for their far from unique style. Decide for yourself - if you're content with meh story but want to see beautiful anime and maybe drop a tear or two, then by all means watch Violet Evergarden but leave your brain in a locker."
tt7078180,"As of yesterday on the 5th of April, Violet Evergarden has finally reached its finish, and wow was it stunning. Not only was its artistry on high bar all throughout each episode, but to see how breathtaking and realistic a show like this portrayed a girl, who all throughout her life could only ever understand orders from others, embarking on a journey of self discovery made me feel not only intrigued, but inspired.Violet Evergarden, a name partly given to her by her late Major, Gilbert Bougainvillea. She was seen as but a mere tool in the time of war and acted on all of her orders without hesitation. After the war, Violet soon becomes employed as an Auto Memories Doll. Although it starts off rough for her, with enough practise, she soon begins to realize the deeper elements of human emotion when writing a letter.Violet as a whole was a very unique character to follow along all throughout these episodes. It was interesting to see a character like her to see through the eyes of not only others around her, but even herself. The joy and pride from her new abilities as a Doll did prove herself to have a strong and positive impact upon others, but also soon left her to face her inner demons after realizing what her actions she inflicted in the past truly left on others.The show genuinely had an extraordinary way of showing to the viewer exactly the kind of depression and sorrow every person in the show felt that Violet was able to change. Whether it was the loss of someone dear or the struggles to find the right words for someone they love, you can see and feel how as Violet is assisting them, they soon begin to find the true beam of light at the end of the tunnel.If there is to be another season, I would gladly go along with it to see more about what the show and character Violet Evergarden has to offer. They surely left things off on a good note, especially in a way that that can be left both ambiguous, and soon-to-be answered for the mere future.Overall this show was without a doubt, a masterpiece to explore and stay hooked onto until the very end. Here in this anime, you see human nature in a fairly different and peculiar perspective that shows us the story of a girl, whom all she wanted to learn from the start was what the words ""I love you"" truly meant."
tt7078180,So beautiful. So many feels. I'm only on episode 10 and I've cried several times so far. I am in love with this masterpiece. It is the best anime I have ever seen.
tt7078180,"Every frame of this show is a work of art hand drawn by an artist. This has got to be the most beautiful anime i have ever seen.(And I've seen a lot of anime) The 2D animation is highly detailed and makes watching this show a truly breathtaking experience. The animation in this show gets a solid 10/10.As for the story well it revolves around Auto Memory Dolls that were originally created by a scientist to aid his blind wife in writing her novels, & later rented out to other people in need of their services. The story follows the life of a Particular Auto Memory Doll called Violet and her interactions with humans. The story is fantastic overall id give it a 9/10."
tt7078180,"I rarely review anime shows, due to the fact that I usually don't get to them until they've been recommended by many people first, but Violet Evergarden was a short series that I felt like getting into upon its initial release. It's not very often that an anime series can present itself and be accessible to a wide range of demographics, but I truly feel as though my obvious praise for this show will go towards all age groups. I haven't seen countless shows and movies like some anime fans have, but I've seen enough to know this is a great one. Tackling real-life issues like war and love, Violet Evergarden also manages to include subtle sci-fi elements to further deepen each and every episode at hand. Whether you enjoy watching anime or not, here's why I believe this show deserves your attention.At a mere 13 episodes, this series follows Violet, an ex-military ""weapon,"" as she now leads her new life as what is known as an Auto Memories Doll. She, along with many others, work in an office for a postal service or travel across the world in order to put people's words to paper. Some may be close to death and may not be able to write and some may just not be good at that sort of thing in general. Her job is to write letters that will leave a lasting impact on those meant to receive them. Told through 13 unique chapters, each episode tells its own story, all while giving emotional backstory to each of the main characters. With so much depth and character development placed into these 13 episodes, it was hard not to fall in love with this well-written show.Yes, it's accessible to those who don't usually watch this style of television, due to the fact that I watched this series dubbed in English and found the voice acting to be satisfactory and was still able to get me emotional. For those who may be hardcore anime fans, I can assure you that the Japanese version will probably suit you better and you may even enjoy it more. When a show can balance love, war, fictional aspects like a postal service using things called Auto Memories Dolls, and the very notion that a single letter can have someone live on in someone's heart forever, then you truly have a masterpiece on your hands.You may feel slightly short-changed as a few of the episodes come to their end because certain elements are never brought up again, but by the time the show concludes, you'll find yourself thinking about everything that happened and wondering why you cared about that in the first place. Almost all episodes stand as their own stories but culminate to a very worthy conclusion that undoubtedly will have tears streaming down the faces of those who really find themselves invested in this premise. Another thing to admire is that in such a short run, this show will leave a lasting impact as one of the best series I've had the pleasure of seeing.In the end, Violet Evergarden does everything beautifully in terms of storytelling and didn't leave me wanting more, which isn't a bad thing at all. Everything is nicely wrapped up in the final episode and each and every preceding episode felt worthy of the wait. This is a show filled with vibrant colors, wonderful animation, terrific characters, fantastic music, and thought-provoking themes. If you're someone who enjoys anime, then I can't recommend this series enough. If you're hesitant on the notion or are new to the medium of anime, I would still recommend this as a nice jumping off point for you. Violet Evergarden is a wonderful story from beginning to end."
tt7078180,"I know that i am exaggerating and many would say that its not so great anime but listen friends you need to see the content with heart and soul and i am sure you will fall in love with this ...

tt7078180,"Why doesn't INDIA makes such a beautiful anime like this. Sorry india don't make any good cartoon or anime like this. When i was a child i grew up watching dragon ball z, blayblade, digimon, dual master. i was not aware that time that it was all anime. Then there was the show called Naruto enters in my life(ofcourse it last till only chunnin exam) which change my thoughts about cartoon(anime). From that moment i came to know that there is something called anime which are far more mature and beautiful than our shitty indian cartoon.
By the time i grew up watching many anime and in my list of favorites I find something named as VIOLET EVERGARDEN.
By watching the first episode I knew that it gonna be a Beautiful ride of animation, background sound and most important Emotions.
For all indians Please do watch This.. It is far better than our family melodramatic Serials...."
tt7078180,"Violet Evergarden story is cliche, predictable, it's one of those plot written Animes that make you expect something bad - and it will -- is going to happen, it almost reminds me of Plastic Memories. Main protagonist goes out on an adventure/journey, and seeks ""this"" meaning to define their existence by visiting newly introduced characters into her life and amending their said problems, or finding this kind of redemption. Violet Evergarden is that and it doesn't exactly fail to present a story with multiple sub plots for the progression of the protagonist.But that's where the unpleasant side comes from, you write a story that revolves around multiple side stories in order to develop the protagonist, but it hinders the development instead, there's no point in the Anime that I felt a connection to the main protagonist due to the crucial absence of an important clarification of the main characters backstory, yes it showed certain crucial moments of the protagonist past, but not exactly enough, there is still explanations that needed to be done, which we didn't get at all, and was surely not drastic enough to create an emotional connection to the viewer, or to me, even after the 10/11th episode that felt like the ending, the plot deteriorates. What's the purpose of the remaining 2 episodes, they are just ""extras"" to add more irrelevant emotions -- being entirely unrelated to the actual reason why we are watching the show, which is about Violet, and not about the new characters that are presented each episode.It lacked and I felt like they needed to focus more on Violet's backstory -- what was her origin, who exactly trained her to be this fearless deadly killer at a very young age, and her family? Things that matter, are not shown. But that is expected from an Anime that doesn't go deep in backstory and expect you to assume the rest in your mind. Just like any other Anime.I won't lie, this anime is enjoyable, the emotional tale of Violet and her journey to seek the meaning of what I love you means to her, a human emotion that she is completely oblivious to. Uncovering or listening to the life stories of each character she meets in order for her to write down an intimate letter for her clients, to put what they genuinely feel in words that they can't express into a piece of paper for the person they care about to understand while herself unfolds the meaning behind the three words ""I love you"" is to her. I can understand why people like it, cause they feel emotional towards the Anime, and it does get to you, adding the spectacular animations, hell, it's great. Watch it.The gorgeous part of this Anime is the Art and Music, the beautiful animation and soundtracks this anime presents to you is astonishing, and it's like this is where half the budget went to. It's really eye-catching and that deserves recognition, for its Animation and music, props to the people who worked on it.Story: 7/10

tt7078180,I binge watched the next 10 episodes after finishing the first one. I wasn't expecting this show to hit me as hard as it did but everything about it show hit home with me. I found for days after and even longer that the episodes stuck with me and I'd continue to think about them. It truly is one of my favorite shows I've watched in a long time and I'm glad I did. My only regret is that the show hasn't been released in full yet so I will have to wait a week each time for a new episode. Violet Evergarden is a damn good watch and I hope everyone gives it a shot.
tt7078180,"I've never cried so hard since VIOLET EVERGARDEN.I bet you never seen anything like this before.This anime actually gives you a perfect definition of letters, you must have heard of people in other reviews mentioning War, love story, Auto memoirs doll etc.,HANDS DOWN!!!!!! Best Anime of the year"
tt7078180,"The story and character development are a masterpiece. You will eventually feel empathy with the main character and it will surely hit you in the feels. Not jut the previous mention, but the animation is wonderful and colorful, which in all, will hook you. Please, if you haven't seen this anime, I recommended to watch the first episode and you'll see what I mean."

tt7221388,"I can't believe how much I enjoy Cobra Kai. I originally thought this was going to be some corny kid show. It's not, any fan of the original trilogy will love this. It takes place 34 years after the events of the first movie and the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament. It follows a down on his luck Johnny Lawrence (William Zavala) as he tries to get his life straightened out and opens up the famous Cobra Kai dojo. This reignites his rivalry with the successful Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio). I can't say enough about how good Zabka is here. He's absolutely the breakout star here! It's a shame he hasn't become a bigger star over the years because he shows he can carry a show here. Again, if you're a fan of the original trilogy then watch this. I promise you'll love it! Looking forward to more seasons in the future."
tt7221388,"I was a teen in the 80's and enjoyed watching this film - as most guys my age did. I was a little skeptical when I saw that they were making a new series that takes place 30 years after the movie ended. But once I saw the trailers - I felt like they might be on to something. After watching several episodes - I can tell you that they nailed it. This is the best show out there - anywhere. It's not over acted (or under acted). It's not corny or stupid either. It's the perfect match up of seriousness with a few goofs or references from the 80's thrown in here & there. This revival could have been a disaster but it looks like they got the perfect combo of writers, directors & actors. It's funny, because as a kid - I wanted to punch Johnny in the throat as hard as I could. But as a 40-something year old - I'm kinda rooting for him. Great job to the people responsible for making this happen - and of course it couldn't have happened without Ralph & William. Thank you!"
tt7221388,"I remember watching the Karate Kid films as a kid, and I cannot express enough how impressed and surprised at the level of quality of this series. It successfully brings back the old ""feel"" of the films, while adding a new and complex storyline. It really embodies the legacy of the rivalry, and yet rebores the spirt of the films to a degree that is just unprecedented. I can't wait to see what they do in Season 2. Amazing job YouTube!"
tt7221388,"I have just this moment finished episode 10. I am literally on a massive high right now. This is probably the best TV series I have seen since I first watched Game of Thrones. This is TV at its most epic best.The thing that makes this TV show is William Zabka. Why he has only been in Karate Kid and nothing much more is a mystery as this guy can act and has amazing screen presence and comedy timing.This TV show was so good it literally makes me want to go out tomorrow and sign up for karate classes and learn Cobra Kai style.I strongly recommend everyone watches this as this is way better than that stupid remake with Will Smiths son, better than all the sequels and to be honest better than the first Karate Kid movie too.William Zabka needs to be cast in other TV roles too. He is up there with the best for TV/movie Anti-hero's; Snake Plissken, Tyler Durdan and now after this Johnny Lawrence."
tt7221388,"As a typical 80's kid who grew up watching Karate Kid hundreds of times, I can truly say that this show does justice to my childhood memories. It's not perfect and can be a little cheesy at times, but all of that is easily forgiven with the magic instilled in this show.The creators did a wonderful job in tying in moments from the original and making them fit with the new. The soundtrack is definitely up to par with the movies, but also adds a little bit of a modern twist to it.Last night I finished episode 7 and all I could think was, ""I wish Disney had paid this much respect to the new Star Wars movies as these guys did with Cobra Kai"".It's a great show and I'm trying my best to savor the last few episodes..."
tt7221388,"The answer has finally come to the age old question of ""How can you introduce nuance into a cut-and-dry good-vs-evil 80's classic"" and it comes in the form of COBRA KAI.
While there are many a homage to the film(s) that spawned it, Cobra Kai makes its own name for itself by (gasp) being very well written, and introducing depth to the degree that neither Johnny nor Daniel-San is really ""the good guy"" or ""the bad guy"". They both make poor decisions, both are dealing with the traumas of their youth (which, in Danny's case, comes down to Johnny himself in many ways), and they both pass on the positive and negative experiences to their children and/or students in various ways. Danny is often motivated by petty revenge and unable to see any good in Johnny and his Cobras (and not entirely for no reason), and Johnny may be saving himself from....himself and his past and giving his students confidence, but also seems to be making them somewhat into monsters.
The show is able to balance all this thematically and do so with poignancy and humor. Unlike, say, an hour-and-a-half long movie, the show is able to burn much more slowly and spend time with its characters and their pasts to provide a tremendous amount of depth. This might even be the thing that makes Youtube Red worth paying for. I'm legitimately hyped for season 2, what the hell. (While I won't spoil the last-minute sting in the final episode, needless to say it's a biggie).Really watch it, you'll be suprised. Hawk is indeed ourguy"
tt7221388,"There are many things to like about this series. Probably the best thing for me is its rejection of political correctness and victimhood culture. Actually, rejection is a strong word and this isn't a protest piece by any means but there is definitely a theme of taking responsibility for one's own fate and confronting adversity with resilience and even some agression. (The show is intelligent enough to portray overt agression or anger as counterproductive). There is one great scene during a karate tournament where a competitor starts pretentiously virtue signalling to the crowd. The reaction of Johnny Lawrence is priceless. Hopefully Hollywood takes note that virtue signalling is not a prerequisite for great entertainment. It's great to see a show that is intelligent with messages to tell but doesn't take itself too seriously."
tt7221388,So season 1 blew me away. Very funny lots of great jokes! It was quirky and fun and had a solid story. Season 2 becomes a stupid teen drama where everything is just inconvenient and dumb like river dale. The ending was such a silly teen drama move I miss season 1.. I hope it goes back to the way it was. 8/10 for now season 2 was a 5/10Edit: SEASON 3 IS A TEEN DRAMA NONSENCE
tt7221388,Season 1 of CobraKai is by far the best. Season 4 is teens making childish decisions and adults making childish decisions. If you love the films you'll appreciate the TV show. William Zabka's Johnny Lawrence is excellent as always and Daniel LaRusso will always be the moral heart of the show. Season 4 was a letdown. It's just teens and the adults all making ridiculous decisions.
tt7221388,How this has an 8.7 rating is beyond me. The only halfway decent parts are the early episodes focusing on Johnny. Besides that it's a cheese-fest with terrible acting throughout.The kids in the show are so laughable it's ridiculous and The Hawk character is one of the stupidest characters I've ever seen on a show. Only reason to watch is nostalgia but that runs thin pretty fast.
tt7221388,"Cobra Kai is so much better than I thought it would be. I grew up a Karate Kid fan but wasn't sure what to expect from this and thought it would be some cheap kiddy money grab. I'm glad I was wrong. It's so much better than it has any business being, especially William Zabka! He absolutely is the star of this show as Johnny Lawrence. You root for him on this more than Daniel (Ralph Macchio)."
tt7221388,"It's corny, predictable, steeped in 1980's nostalgia, full of nods to the original... and those are just some of the reasons to LOVE it! Credit to everyone involved in the making of this series. If you are a fan of the original films then this is going to be exactly what you are looking for. John Avildsen and Pat Morita are definitely here in spirit. Perfect for binge-watching and for transporting yourself back 30 years! :)"
tt7221388,"This show is the perfect mix of nostalgia, great 80s music, and badass karate. William Zabka makes this show as Johnny Lawrence, he is everything. Storylines are interesting, action scenes are well coordinated, and everyone and their brother comes back from the movies. It's lovely."
tt7221388,"I was a big KK fan back in the day and this ticks all the nostalgia boxes while managing to be awesome in it's own right. The acting is great, the story is great and it takes the plot in directions I never expected while making you feel for the characters.Great work, bring on the next season :D"
tt7221388,"I didn't have many expectations going into this show, or at least, I didn't have high expectations. The ones I did have were that of a fun low budget romp down memory lane. But this is so much more than that. The production values are great, the casting is great, the plot, the writing, the tone, pacing, soundtrack. It's all great start to finish and it has what Mr. Miyagi taught us, balance. It seems to hit so many right notes without pushing anything too far, the comedy is just right, the emotional moments, just right, the cheese, the action, just right. It also does a great job of leaving the viewer to decide who the real heroes and villains are because unlike the movies nothing here is black and white. If you've seen the films, you will really enjoy this. If you haven't, you'll probably really enjoy it anyway. It stands on its own and feels modern, but as a continuity, 30 years later, it does this masterfully and very respectfully to its past and its source without heavily relying on it. BANSAI!!!"
tt7221388,"It is an entertaining series, I really like the 80's throwbacks but why, with all these assaults, robberies, and destruction of property, all of which are felonies, are the police never there or even called. I understand it is all entertainment, but some small dose of reality would help."
tt7221388,"Impressed, captivated and engaged are the words that come to mind for Cobra Kai. This is what we need from shows, to take unique and interesting angles. Cobra Kai flips the script and gives us the view from Johnny Lawrence, this is really his story. He's the one who lost and turns out to be a real person with very real flaws. Cobra Kai intrigues us with its great narrative. No more one dimensional 'Good vs Evil' story we've all been told a million times over. This reflects the feelings of the 'loser' of the memorable 1984 film Karate Kid and picks up 34 years later. Because of this narrative and spin I find Johnny to be an inspirational figure by trying his best to rebuild his life. Johnny is a very down to earth and simple character and is making the most of the hand dealt to him, isn't that how we live our lives? In a funny way we see the arrogance and attitude sometimes from Daniel Larusso who was originally the hero. Top marks for a great show."
tt7221388,"Cobra Kai was a pleasent surprise. A guilty pleasure maybe, but the show is really entertaining and that is way more than I expected. I didn't really like the karate kid movies, but this show has way more in it.Unfortunately as of season 4 it goes downhill. Severe phyisical injuries can heal in no time, people start to be friends with people who literally kicked you in the hospital. With everyone liking each other, all tension is lost. In season 5 the show tries to bring the tension back with a new common villain. But the show does too little with it.And then there is season 6. My god. I have never seen such a bad fighting choreography, bad acting, slow and stupid and boring screenplay in my life. I felt my IQ decrease watching season 6, I couldn't bear watching it any longer so halfway episode 3 I decided to do something more useful with my time and started to watch how the grass outside in my front lawn is growing."
tt7221388,"I was hooked with the first season. Strong acting, excellent story and believable characters, and a fun amount of ""fish out of water"" as the character Johnny, who almost seems to have time-warped directly from the 1980's, adapts to the modern age and gets back on his feet again with reopening Cobra Kai. But here's where the problem seems to come in for me: the drive of the show seems to be that of Johnny not only reopening Cobra Kai, but becoming successful with that. And he clearly does that as we are firmly into season 2. But then beyond that, as we get more into the episodes of season 3, you start to wonder: where is this going? He met his goal, he has a tenuous friendship with old rival Daniel, so... now what? Or more so, who cares? What, we just keep on the ride and wait for more nostalgia of old characters returning? To me this felt like X-files in the later seasons: the formula just got tired and you're left wondering where is the series going? The teen soapy elements also get progressively more annoying into the third season so I had to bow out of this one. Much like Stranger Things, stick with the first season and leave it at that."
tt7221388,"Cobra Kai is, hands down, the best series ever made. Perfectly crafted, inch by inch, to bring back the essence of the original film. This is how you do a sequel. I enjoyed every second of it."
tt7818686,"***Hints of jokes, but no punchlines spoiled***I found James' special on Netflix, randomly browsing. I had no expectations and was equally prepared to be surprised or disappointed.Instead - I found myself thoroughly entertained by a master storyteller who manages to fuse the mundane and absurd so well that you almost it.Elements such as jury duty, retail strategies for honey, and kitchen mirrors were used to deliver delightful chuckles at the sheer idiocy of we humans. My favorite bit was the existential ponderings triggered by a visit to the dentist. Bravo James.This is a fellow to keep an eye on."
tt7818686,"My favourite comedian of the moment! Finding the funny in the most mundane of things and bringing a unique angle to the current comedy circuit.Acaster is timeless, original, out there and the king of bringing older jokes back in without anticipation. Refreshing and clever!"
tt7818686,"I mostly knew James Acaster from some panel shows he went on. I then remembered seeing that he had a comedy special on netflix, and decided to watch it. First of all, I was agreeably surprised by the fact that it was a series of 4 stand up shows, I had never seen that before.And watching it, every joke, every situation being randomly delivered until, at the very end of every episode he brings it all together like a puzzle of a rainbow he'd been designing this all time... I was amazed.
In the end, he was hilarious, dramatic and he is a genie in comedic composition, if that's ever a thing."
tt7818686,"James Acaster is my favourite comedian of all time. I've seen every TV appearance he's made, all his live clips online, listened to all of his classic scrapes and read his book. I LOVE this man, he has the ability to make me no matter what. So when I heard that 4 hours worth of his material was going to be put on Netflix, I was ecstatic to say the least.Every part of this four-part comedic masterpiece is hilarious. The show is made up of new and old material. The old stuff still lands as well as it did the first time I heard it and the new stuff was amazing to see.Each episode has James (colour coordinated with the stage background) seemingly rambling about unconnected topics for 55 minutes at a time, but by the end you realise that you've seen an perfectly plotted show that managed to somehow get a very strange plot across.Gags like James playing us his comedy podcast, talking about jury duty, massages, pictures-you-put-your-head-in, folding boxes, Google logos, Dr Pepper, conga lines, Mexican restaurant cutlery and how to break the ice sound like they don't connect but by the end of all four you're aware you've seen something special.The final episode especially manages to tie in in-jokes from all three other episodes as well as some more new material that manages to cap off the whole show and make you feel like you've seen one 4-hour set rather than four unrelated shows.It's unlikely, but I hope that more of Acaster's work makes it to Netflix as more people need to be exposed to his genius. If you love Acaster like I do, this will be the highlight of your year so far. If you've never heard of him then do yourself a favour and check this out, you'll love it."
tt7818686,By far the best comedy special released by Netflix this year.
tt7818686,"At points while watching this, you genuinely ask yourself, how am I laughing this hard? That was completely and very comically bizarre. But that man is a genius and the way he links together his jokes, rants and strange mannerisms into 50 or so minutes will not only have you questioning yourself and your existence through his absurd, thought provoking dialogues, but will also cheer you up without fail and have you in stitches throughout. 10/10I made a whole account just to write this review. People deserve to see this."
tt7818686,"According to a comic friend of mine. James Acaster is known as the comedian that comedians would pay to watch. His ""Repertoire"" series on Neflix is akin to performance art. It is intricately yet seamlessly crafted. It follows to say that the devil is in the detail, and that Mr Acaster beguiles and bedazzles Lucifer into submission. Comedy is subjective, so all are welcome to disagree. However as a wise man... or woman once said ""shut up! My opinion is well better than yours!"""
tt7818686,"This is more of a performance piece than what is traditionally a ""stand-up"" comedy routine...well, four routines. Highly intelligent, written with precision and masterfully acted, James Acaster reinvents the genre and gives a radically new take on the stand-up. While it's wide-ranging, it all seems to be of a piece and each episode could stand alone, but there are references to what's come before that invite the audience to join in the joke. The persona Acaster gives is someone who may be a little dim, but his ponderings--sometimes with one sentence or sometimes a lengthy story--sharply illustrate today's modern culture. He/she will recognize situations if not necessarily brand names (Pret a Manger) or the finer details of Brexit. Eschewing what's typically become a ribald forum for shocking the audience, this (these pieces) are at a much higher plain using language to unmask the viewer rather than berate us with the obvious. Thoroughly entertaining and fresh."
tt7818686,"Well I just finished all the episodes and they weave together masterfully. Each episode i thought he is working his way up my list of favorite comedians with Bill Burr, Pete Holmes, Brian Regan, and Andy Woodhul. By the final episode and seeing that he just did a 4-5 hour comedy special the all wove together... fantastic. So damn funny."
tt7818686,"The scope of these specials is defiantly something to be amazed by. The first three shows are loosely connected, with the final show, Recap, linking them all. It's an interesting idea and allows for intricate call backs and helps create some jokes that wouldn't have been possible either.Each special stands up on it's own (however Recap will be less impactful if you've not seen the previous) and within it, there are plenty of absurd observations and enactments. The only stipulation is that if you're a fan of James Acaster you may have heard quite a few of these segments on various panel shows. There's still a ton of stuff you won't have seen and lots of the stuff you would have heard is more confidently delivered here, but that is something to consider.As an aside, a common topic with US vs UK comedy is that US comedy is just jokes where as UK comedy tries to also have a narrative, which leads to US comedy being much more joke and laugh oriented, but perhaps not as personal. UK comedy has more of an arc so feels more like a 'complete' piece of standup (rather than a series of funny 'bits') and this seems like the perfect example of this. It's all connected but only uses that to elevate the comedy. Well worth a watch."
tt7818686,"The least you could say about James Acaster is that he's a weirdo, but he's the good kind of weird. Very strange way of thinking about daily things, but always well brought on stage. He's entertaining to watch, knows what an audience wants, and although he speaks quite rapidly for a foreigner like me it's understandable, but it's better with subtitles. I watched the four episodes or shows in four days. One per day, all weird, with the last one being the best of the four. The last one resumes his other shows, makes it all click together, so it is best to watch this repertoire in a short time to experience it all better."
tt7818686,Laughed a lot more than I have done during any Netflix special to date.If I was not laughing I was very intrigued to what was going on... and apparently so was the audience. It was electric and very enjoyable to hear the response from the crowd. Great timing and pacing...bravely let's the audience linger for longer than I've seen anybody do before. This is a classic and will stand the test of time no doubt. Also check out classic scrapes on youtube. If this type of humor is your kind of thing.
tt7818686,Acaster is one of my favorite comedians as he's a great character by himself. He's also one of the few that make smart jokes and this 4ep series show was cleverly made.
tt7818686,"I have watched this probably 5 times now.. James Acaster is extremely unique and insanely funny. Who in this world would rate this 4/10 o.0 and say that they didn't have any ""haha"" moments... Maybe someone who can't understand brilliant comedy? This is such a great watch and there are 4! 50 min episodes.. James absolutely spoils the audience silly... Will always be one of my favorite comedy specials ever made."
tt7818686,"First things first. Would like to advise using subtitles for American audience. He does speak very clearly and his points are deliberate, but having subtitles made it a more enjoyable watch.Now, with comedy it's either very raunchy, or very political, or it appears to feel that way as of late. James comes in with a fantastic four piece set that keeps you engaged and has very satisfying call backs. He does touch on politics, but it's British politics so right there it's not too much. He keeps it very clean for the most part, but still doesn't make me feel like a child!Only complaint is that it appears each episode has a prolonged skit that feels like it goes on for far too long, but even then the whole episode has great pace and it's still very easy to enjoy! Some of my favorite jokes of all comedy come from this special, and it is definitely worth a watch!"
tt7818686,"Something that stands out while watching a stand up is how the majority of comedians are really trying to be funny. I remember when I first started watching George Carlin and very soon I was convinced this guy was conceived, born and raised to do comedy. He was not trying, he just was.
James Acaster is still too young to be put in the same basket as Carlin and other greats, however his amazing writing, delivery, composure and intelligence are all testaments to greatnesses in the making.
At no point he's trying to be funny. He really truly naturally is."
tt7818686,"I had a great time watching Repertoire. These four episodes are creatively and hilariously interwoven! From random topics such as his hometown football club chant, to a banana shop grudge, James Acaster keeps the watcher entertained from the first minute to the last. I would recommend watching back to back if you have the time, but its just as funny in parts! Whether it's old or new jokes, Acaster delivers in a unique and funny way. Not for everyone, but give it a go!"
tt7818686,"Hilarious, very very funny, sensitive, agile and intelligent.James Acaster is a breath of fresh air, the imaginative worlds and the absurd situations James creates are genius.I read a bad review here by a reviewer who obviously doesn't know what the term white noise means or must have had a humour by-pass op."
tt7818686,"I've never seen anything quite like this, and I love it! I first discovered James Acaster because I enjoy John Mulaney's stand-up performances, and when I Googled what other comedians are similar to Mulaney, James Acaster's name came up. While I can see how in general his style is similar to Mulaney's, with the use of storytelling and the focus on quotidian details, Acaster's performance is more imaginative, absurd, and physical. He is in a class of his own! Very original writing, and he plays with the timing in interesting ways. It's a bit of a roller coaster! Although I will say that I think the first and last episodes of Repertoire are a little stronger than the other two, I loved all four episodes."
tt7818686,"I'd never heard of James Acaster until I saw this pop up on Netflix around a year ago. Just watching a minute of the trailer I knew it was going to be good, and I wasn't disappointed.He manages to turn the mundane into hilarious gags. Here we have free bananas, an undercover cop, a stint in witness protection and honey racket. That's without plenty of celebrity gossip!I've watched these four specials dozens of times, and I'm yet to get bored of his humour. It might not be to everybody's taste, but if it is, you will love it.Give it a try."
tt7818686,"An absolute delight. I was captivated by Acaster's unique style and delivery. His comedic timing is impeccable, and his ability to weave together hilarious anecdotes and observations had me laughing throughout the entire show.It also has an innovative structure and interconnectivity. Each show builds upon the previous one, creating a cohesive narrative that keeps the audience engaged and intrigued. He tackles a wide range of topics, from personal experiences to societal observations. It's evident that James puts a lot of thought into his material, crafting jokes that are both intelligent and absurdly funny. It's a masterclass in stand-up comedy."
tt7818686,"4/2/18. I did watch the entire four-episodes, though in retrospect I don't know why. Maybe it was because his humor was clean and sometimes clever, but there was no ha-ha moments to speak of. Maybe if you have nothing better to do and you want some rambling noise to fill the silence, then this one's for you."
tt8398600,"My favourite line .......""I'd rather be nowhere with her than somewhere without her"""
tt8398600,"I stumbled across After Life when I wasn't interested in anything on My List and I didn't care to Continue Watching anything either. I've never been married and I've never lost the love of my life, mainly because I haven't met them, but I have struggled with depression for years now and this past year has been a particularly hard battle. The portrayal of grief and depression I found to be very relatable, the story was told very realistically and the cast were brilliant. I particularly loved Anne and Daphne. Perfect show to binge watch and just allow yourself to feel all of the emotions and then share it with someone because nothing's as good if you don't share it."
tt8398600,"An almost unbelievable mix of beauty, sadness, and laughs. The characters are well cast and have great chemistry. The premise is heartbreaking but so many beautiful moments happen, you can almost forget. A lovely show on loss, love, and keeping going."
tt8398600,My wife and I watched Season 1 and laughed and cried our way through it. I'm having to do Season 2 on my own as my wife's three year struggle with cancer recently ended. I find his detailed understanding of the grief amazingly accurate. Tony's pain seeps through the screen. Ricky is a genius and an authentic human being.
tt8398600,"Ricky Gervais knows how to make you laugh and ugly cry, sometimes together. I think this is my favorite of his series. He speaks right to the dark, sad, and angry part in all of us. He also shows us that everyone is beautiful.The series is beautifully shot, the cast is fantastic and each character has a slow reveal from who they are in Tony's eyes to who they really are. It's beautifully done.Only Ricky Gervais can pull off shows like After Life and Derek. I hope he gives us more."
tt8398600,"Easily his best work since 'The Office', maybe even his best work. Poignant, funny, heart warming and beautifully acted. If you watch one thing this year make it this (clearly you won't just watch one thing but not matter how many it is, make sure After Life is included). It is 6 episodes of the most beautifully crafted television on a subject matter that has no right to be this funny. However, the humour is always tinged with sadness (and vice versa) and the balance between the two is perfect.Just watch it and prepare to cry, laugh and maybe just put a little bit of perspective into your life."
tt8398600,I watched the show in one sitting. It is challeging. It makes you think with great humor. It has its dramas. It will make you almost cry while making you laugh. It's genius and I recommend you watch it if you think you are depressed or you see no point in life. And I guess it's greatest characteristic is that its honest.
tt8398600,"I have to be honest, this is one of the best series I have watched in some time, it really is Gervais at his very best.This five part series is moving, funny, poignant, and intensely thought provoking, it forces you to think of death, loss, dementia, and of course the force of life.The characters are absolutely glorious, each and every one, and despite some of my absolute favourite talents being here, such as Penelope Wilton, David Bradley and Ashley Jensen, it's the performance of Roisin Conaty that I enjoyed most of all, I adored Daphne.I know many of us wish the series was longer, but in this instance I'd say the standard is so high, leave it be.This was magical. 10/10"
tt8398600,"Ricky Gervais is a divisive character but I've always been a big fan of his. I love his style of comedy and have always enjoyed his shows in the past. However, I think with 'After Life' Gervais has achieved more than just another great show and has exceeded even my very high expectations.This series covers a topic that few would dare go - the story of a man grieving after the loss of his lifelong partner. It could have made for thoroughly miserable viewing. Instead, Gervais has given us a truly thought-provoking, touching show that manages to perfectly balance dark, sad themes with some classic Gervais-style humour.It feels so real and so relatable, from the story to the character and dialogue - you forget you are watching a work of fiction. Gervais also does a great job at pushing some important messages (though never too forcefully), the most important being to take nothing in life for granted and to enjoy the short time we have on this planet. I can't recommend this show enough - a must watch!"
tt8398600,"Season 1 was ""brilliant"" as Tony says, but season 2 was a clear step down for me. Right away, the basic plot line has been reset - which makes the whole season feel very repetitive. As some other reviewers have also pointed out, I also am beginning to find Tony's two tones of self sorrow or overzealous spieling to be getting a little repetitive and borderline annoying too (although sometimes funny).Definitely the worst part of the season is this psychiatrist character being continually incorporated. He's a disgusting character (which is fine) but doesn't really add anything at all to show - zero comedy effect, zero character development for Tom (who's seeing him now), and he's not really even an antagonist. So, he just seems like a filler character who's extremely unpleasant to watch.I was hoping Season 2 would be the next phase of Tony's grieving as he starts to overcome his loss while trepidly beginning to see a new woman, but no, it's all just reset - and I wouldn't be surprised if it's just to squeeze an extra season out of this premise, as I'm sure this was renewed for at least two more seasons from Netflix after the first one was such a success - and once his ""grieving"" is gone, it's not really the same show anymore, is it?"
tt8398600,"Ricky Gervais does it again.
Makes me laugh, makes me cry and makes me think!
I rather have six brilliant episodes than 20 so and so!"
tt8398600,"Series 1 was excellent. Refreshing, funny, clever, excellent characterisations.Series 2 was good, Refreshing, funny, clever, excellent characterisations. But whilst S1 felt like it covered some ground and made some conclusions, S2 took a step back and treaded water.Series 3 was the same as S1 and S2 but nowhere near as refreshing, funny or clever. The characterisations were not as good. Several of the best characters are no longer there, replaced by crude characterisations that appear unrealistic and over the top, and a bit nasty.Parts of it are still very funny and well observed but it feels like its a downgrade on S3. Some of the observations are no longer revelations or shocking, but repeats."
tt8398600,"After Life. Hmmmm.Look, I'll be straight up - I don't rate After life has highly as Ricky's other work. For me it plays the melodramatic card way to much, pretty much non-stop. A massive over use of melodramatic music throughout. That said, season one and two were still better than most things on tele. There was enough funny moments, interesting characters and Ricky's usual satire to keep me engaged and entertained. One of the best things about season 1 and 2 is how they tied it all up into a poignant ending. The character arcs came to their conclusion. So overall it was good series. Solid couple of seasons despite its irritating aspects.So why the hell did they make season 3?Gervais only ever made two seasons of all his other shows. It's a good rule. After Life season 3 serves as irrefutable proof of that. It really should not have been made. For me it really harms the whole series legacy. Season 3 just ramps up all the annoying things about the previous two seasons - Chiefly the melodrama. Those bloody flashback videos of his wife. Sure, poignant at first, but now a broken record player. Was tiresome in season 2, let alone now. The chats with Penelope Wilton on the bench! Yawn. Does she just sit on that bench her whole life? Ricky constantly using the C-word thinking it is cool. It really isn't.I could go on about a lot of things here but ultimately season 3 is really unnecessary and just highlights the cons of the show in general. Just feels like an excuse to give Ricky and his acting mates something to do. However, despite my criticism, season 3 still has funny moments, the cast still do well and is probably better than a lot of other comedies that are around at the moment, such is the times. But easily Ricky's most self-indulgent work."
tt8398600,One of the best series I've ever seen in my entire life. Sweet and fun in a shrewd and truly original way. Each episode is more and more beautiful and the whole series encourages you to go on because it never gets boring.
tt8398600,Best thing Gervais has ever produced and the bar was set very high. Couldn't stop watching.
tt8398600,"(Review updated after Season 3).Tony's wife of 25 years, Lisa, has just died of cancer, leaving Tony a shattered, suicidal wreck. He goes from happy, caring and fun-loving person to cynical, rude and self-destructive. He figures that there's no downside to acting this way: after all, if things get too dire he can always commit suicide. But what if there are things and people worth living for?Written by, directed by and starring Ricky Gervais, After Life is a brilliant drama. Incredibly relevant, relatable, realistic and dark. Makes you think about your own life, how you handle tragedy and other setbacks, what it all means and what's important to you.Clever, original and bold plot from Gervais. Can't think of too many movies or TV series that have captured how one deals with tragedy, and suicidal tendencies, so directly and confrontingly ('Leaving Las Vegas' would be the best example I can think of). Not at all predictable: from the outset there are several paths the plot could have taken and Gervais keeps his options open all the way through.It's not all drama though. With Tony's character being so cynical, there is plenty of room for comedy. The humour comes thick and fast, without detracting from the seriousness of the subject matter. The jokes are woven into the dialogue so well that the humour doesn't seem forced at all.Great work by Gervais in the lead role. We know he can do drama, from 'Derek', especially, but his work here is quite eye-opening. The casting of Ashley Jensen is a masterstroke: the two of them recapture the chemistry they had in 'Extras' to great effect. Credit too to Anti as Brandy the dog - probably my favourite character in the series!On the negative side, Season 2 is initially a bit disappointing. Season 1 was so brilliant and self-contained the series didn't need a second season. My fears were initially justified when, instead of progressing the story, S2 seemed to almost go back to Square 1. Even worse, the tone was lowered considerably by the course, unprofessional psychologist. He wasn't even funny, so not sure what purpose he served, other than to irritate viewers. Season 2's latter half is superb, however, and more than makes up for the slow, tonally disappointing, start.No such problems with Season 3 though which is, for me, the best season of the lot. Hilariously funny and at the same time the deepest, most profound and most emotional of all the seasons.A superb series and evidence that Ricky Gervais is a force to be reckoned with not just in comedy but also in drama.Season 1 - 10/10, Season 2 - 9/10, Season 3 - 10/10."
tt8398600,"From office to Extras to stand up to Xfm/Ricky gervais show. This is unlike anything I've seen from Ricky , a complete story told so true and heart breaking to watch at times. Very funny but u kinda laugh through the pain for most of it. Encapsulating watch. Well done again that man, class."
tt8398600,"This is the first review Ive ever written, the first Ive ever felt compelled to write.
This season follows a man whose heart was broken by the death of a loved one. At times it is uproariously funny, I laughed out loud whilst alone, which for me, is very rare. But the overall feeling I was left with was uplifting.
Each of the characters are believable and someone that suffers from mental illness, I found a lot of what the protagonist was feeling was relatable.
I know that Ricky Gervais is a polarising figure, but even if you're not a fan, I urge you to watch."
tt8398600,"Binch-watched it in a few hours. It's brilliant, fresh and endearing. Makes you laugh and cry at the same time."
tt8398600,"Ricky Gervais has created a brilliantly poignant, hilarious, and relatable look at life. All of our lives. And death. In small town UK. The characters are so well written and all of the actors do a spectacular job portraying them. You would be hard-pressed to find a better TV series than this one. Hopefully Netflix doesn't kill After Life too soon."
tt8398600,"Last year I was raving about this. I love Ricky Gervais sense of humor. Especially here as a fresh widower who not only can't get over his wife's death, lashes out at everyone as a result. The first season was perfection.. the first three episodes showing how lost he was (and mean) and the next three showing how kind he could be on the inside. At the end it seemed he was coming to terms with life moving on even thought he still missed his darling Lisa.Second season, yikes. I realize they had to continue things but that is just what they did, continue things. Somewhat unnecessarily. You can kind of see male narcissism on display here (which was missing from the first season) Tony (Gervais) goes on these long talks about Lisa with everyone he talks to. No concern for them, when, he might have been there initially to try to cheer them up. Lisa this, Lisa that, ... (that might be a point but it doesn't seem he ever notices or changes) He was much less affected last season. But the the thing that irritated me the most was his constant using of Anne (Penelope Wilton) his cemetery friend. Every time he sits down he starts talking about himself. Never does he ask about her. We also have a side plot that I didn't care for. Gervais is the king of lovable but over confident losers... and that plot is ok but it seems glaring that the real relationship that ""Tony"" needs to explore and flesh out is with Sandy. Not in a romantic way but as a mentor / mentee which might bring him out of his stupor. But that was very short shrifed in favor of other plots that were sort of retreads of the first season and cringe inducing. I never want to see the therapist again. He is only funny in small dribs with Tony.More of the German Shepard what a sweet thing."
tt8398600,"I just watched the entire thing in one go, and honestly think it's the best work he's ever done. Just brilliant."
tt8398600,"The first season of After Life is probably one of the greatest TV shows I have ever seen. Gervais conjures up a perfect blend of dry humour and heartbreaking poignancy, ably assisted by his trusty accomplices Ashley Jensen and Kerry Godliman. These two women are absolutely exceptional throughout the series and both bring out the best in Gervais as an actor. There are some incredibly funny moments during the show and we are lucky to have some great comic actors like Joe Wilkinson and Tony Way to provide the lighter side to such a sad story. Gervais himself is bitingly hilarious and his morbid view of the world and its inhabitants provides the best lines and scenes of the series.The second season however, would have to rank as one of the biggest disappointments I can remember. Firstly, I cannot see any reason for this being made in the first place. The first season ended perfectly and was wonderfully succinct. There was basically nothing left to work with. All the characters had developed satisfyingly and the finale left things nicely open to possibility. Just leave it there and you have an all-time classic stand-alone comedy. But no. Whether it be for money, attention or sheer stupidity, Gervais couldn't help but dredge up another series, despite having absolutely no basis for a story.Season two accomplishes little more than taking the good aspects of season one and squeezing every last drop out of them and taking the worst aspects of season one and labouring them even further.The heartwarming scenes between Gervais and Penelope Wilton at the cemetery are now pushed so far into your face you almost need to scrape them off your tonsils. Does she literally just sit there all day long waiting for him to stumble by? How many times does she need to tell him what a good man he is for us to wilt at his despair?Then we have the romance between Gervais and Jensen. The progression of their relationship was told brilliantly in season one. It ended perfectly and nothing more needed to be known or said. Instead, we have the almost exact same scenario replayed again tiresomely over 6 episodes.We also don't need to know anymore about Lenny and his new family, we don't care about the tedious Matt and his boring relationship breakdown and while David Earl was quite funny in season one, he certainly isn't needed here. This is all just padding resulting from the fact that there is no basis for a story.On top of this, we have even more Roisin Conaty- comfortably the worst character in the show. Not only is she a dreadful actor, her character is ludicrously unrealistic. Are we really supposed to buy into this local friendly prostitute with a big heart who, like all the other female characters in this show, fawn over Gervais in every scene? I could just about tolerate her presence in the first season but there is no need for her to feature so prominently here.The psychiatrist played by Paul Kaye is mildly funny in season one but degenerates into a total mess in these later episodes. His excessive lines are indicative of some of the cheap vulgarity that Gervais is guilty of in much of his work. A 100-year old woman repeatedly saying the c-word? Sorry, not having it.By far the worst feature of the series is the inclusion of Sandy, played by Mandeep Dhillon, whose sole purpose appears to be crying meekly at poor Tony's misery. Aside from her character being completely unrealistic and misplaced, she seems to be little more than a narcissism enabler for Gervais' increasingly pompous character.And one final gripe, something common to nearly all of Gervais' work, is his tendency to work his religious and philosophical beliefs into the script at every turn. Diane Morgan's character is little more than a prop for him to belittle with his superior intellect and understanding. This is not Tony speaking, this is Gervais plain and simple. Self-indulgence and arrogance loosely disguised as dialogue.After Life is a stark example of why a writer should know when to quit. One of the great things about The Office was it's brevity- it ended when it needed to and, to this day, remains one of the best comedy shows ever made. It is hugely frustrating that After Life was dragged through the wringer in this manner as the first season really was something special."
tt6150576,"I stumbled on this series by accident as a recommendation by Netflix for me to watch it and I don't know why but I had a feeling Midnight Diner will be amazing and it turned out to be a an absolute gem. My only complaint is that wasn't long enough so I am certainly hoping for a 2nd season!The sound track is perfect, really sets the mood and the dialogue is smooth and even though I had to use subtitles Midnight Diner made me appreciate the little things in life. The conversations you have with a few close friends, your memorable encounters with total strangers who impact your life immensely. This series has all of that.There is plenty of drama too! But the sort of humorous drama, the type that create great stories to tell in the future."
tt6150576,"As someone who doesn't speak or understand any Japanese, has never been to Japan and knows virtually nothing about the culture, this series charmed the hell out of me. It's as beautifully shot as it is scored, and it really does have a feeling of craftsmanship about it. The premise - an anthology of human stories, linked together by a graveyard shift diner hidden away in the midst of Shinjuku that caters to both a cast of regulars and one-off visitors - and the construction of each individual tale is charming without falling too far into twee familiarity, and each story is perfectly realised. Kaoru Kobayashi towers as the quietly sympathetic Master, who will cook any dish for anyone, so long as they bring him the ingredients... which gives the show its neat device of theming each episode around a particular recipe. Whether as a symbol of or conduit for togetherness, comfort, romantic or familial relationships, or a Proust-like trigger for bittersweet memories that can never be entirely recaptured, food provides a delicately illustrated metaphor throughout the series. The issues that the Master's customers face are frequently weighty and almost always universal, but the tone is light enough to take it all in stride and, if the characters feel like archetypes, it's because they're meant to be drawn broadly. Part of the show's whole concept is, just like the remembered taste of a childhood delicacy, to evoke a sense of otherworldly nostalgia - to create something unreal in the liminal space of midnight, in the idea of an oasis untouched by the city; the otherness that strips away illusion - and that evokes feelings rather than the realism of minutiae. Perhaps the show is at its least successful when it dips into magic realism, but at its core this is a collection of great stories, told well and seasoned with enough humour and enough pathos to satisfy any appetite."
tt6150576,"The Master who runs the fabulous 12-seat Midnight Diner has a zen-like all-knowing calm - and almost magically can conjure up dozens of different dishes in his tiny kitchen.Every food serving takes us into wonderful human stories about our foibles, mistakes, regrets and second chances.As we get to know the diner's regulars, we become regulars too - glorying in the calm oasis this eatery and its people offer us.The bite-sized stories run less than 30 minutes and it's easy to binge and get through the series all too quickly. We've now devoured all 50 episodes but are still hungry for a new season of these wonderful tales.Here's hoping Netflix green lights a sixth season - it's the perfect recipe for our disrupted world."
tt6150576,"Each episode have its own story which is beautiful and heartwarming. I wish to know more about the master, how he open the diner at the beginning, his own background story, why is he still single (he must have his own family tho).. The master looks so mature, he knows everything.. Wish I have someone like him to talk to..I dont even skip the intro, the soundtrack and masters voice is sooooooo soothing... Makes me feel relief..."
tt6150576,"This Japanese series is beautiful and interesting, simple and wonderful, music was indescribable, Certainly l recommend it"
tt6150576,Haven't found a show this addicting in a long time. It is entirely engaging in a way I cannot describe.
tt6150576,"Imperfect characters acting in virtuous ways. Portrayed by actors that come across as genuine and real. Wonderful music, reminds me of traditional American folk. Authentic Japanese values and culture presented, according to my Japanese couch buddy."
tt6150576,I enjoyed every episode! Wish there were more. Loved it!
tt6150576,"I accidentally came across this series while browsing in Netflix and... am addicted.
Is it its simplicity, the amazing food, the backstories, the characters? I don't know as its all there and its really funny. After watching a few episodes I always feel so relaxed. It is calming and still luring.
Love it and start now season 2 of the second TV series (there seem to be two?!) and hope I wont finish too early..
LOVE IT"
tt6150576,"This show grows on you immediately from the first episode. The stories of the diner's patrons are grounded in such humble reality that it's not difficult to imagine why this was a hit overseas. I quiver in anticipation should this wonderful series be renewed for a second season (do it Netflix! Please!). Watching it is as satisfying as one of Master's dishes. The direction, the cast, the sets leave absolutely nothing to be desired. It easily ranks among my favorite TV series and I still have two episodes to go - but I'm savoring them."
tt6150576,"A very engaging TV show that I've simply come to really love, depicting both the frailty and the resilience of the human condition. Beautifully written and scripted, I only wish I knew fluent Japanese instead of relying on the closed-caption translations. One particular episode, Season 2 Episode 4, ""Fried Chicken Wings"", revolved around the life of Chizuru Morino, an attractive model who realizes her youthful looks are behind her and she must come to terms with the end of her modeling career. Simply cannot find the name of the actress who portrayed Chizuru in this episode. Funny, her names does not appear in any list of cast members of this episode, and you would think they would at least list the name of the episode's central character! Does anyone out there know her name?"
tt6150576,"An unusual izakaya that opens from midnight to 7 am, and serves atypical foods to an eclectic group of diners ... yes, please!But the food is not the main point of this series. Rather, it is the customers who come to share their angst and worries to each other or to the Master (chef/owner) that makes it interesting.Many of these characters are sympathetic, despite their flaws or perhaps because of them. Their situations may not be common, but they are believable and certainly riveting. Even the mysterious Master himself is a curious character.Unfortunately, the short format gives only a cursory treatment to each customer. I only wish that the episodes were longer than 30-minutes each, to give a bit more time for exploring more fully each character and their situations.In any case, this is an enjoyable series good for binging."
tt6150576,"I've live in Japan 50 years and in the Shinjuku area 10 - 6 of them in the area just a few blocks of the ""location"" of this shokudou. How wonderful to something this close to what I've known (and been to many times). This series will introduce you to a side of the Japanese that is otherwise very hard to find, unless you speak good Japanese. For others try Okuribito, Shoushiki, and of course Tampopo. You might be even a little envious that you don't live here."
tt6150576,"Not much to say, other than that this is a beautiful little show that will make you laugh for all the right reasons.I actually thought it was some kind of foodie reality show, so I'm happy to have given it a try just in case."
tt6150576,This series is my favorite ever. It's a feel-good series like the movie Amelie. I have cried at almost each episode. It's such a gem. hope there will be a third season
tt6150576,"It's an humble allegory for people serching the right path. Sometimes the customers are lost in personal problems just to find guidance in simple words.
The Master can make whatever customers request, as long as they have the ingredients for it on their hearts.
Delicious little show both ways, belive me, I've done some of the dishes too."
tt6150576,"I don't remember when i watched a serie as warm as this one, super addicting very sincere"
tt6150576,"Straight off the bat to let you know who is reviewing... i love JCVD movies. Shallow and profound are the flix i like. I don't know why i have such taste for such drab.... Honesty and clarity is a great starting point. I have fallen in love with this show - why? i don't know. But here's the miracle. It has nothing to do with any of the movies i have loved in the past. This breaks all the films of my shallow judgements and is not something i would think i would ever appreciate. Without understanding why, i love this show. It was so refreshing it is a show i will remember for the rest of my life. if it is not your type of flick im sure u will forget it - however if u like it you will love it. Last season was 2016 so i assume no more seasons - i was emotional affected but this realisation.Please watch first season.... watch it honestly (not in front of your iphone). It is a treasure in a world of limiting values.We need more of this."
tt6150576,"I have no idea how the manga goes. And I don't seem to have access to a translated version so this show will have to do.The idea is interesting. But the overall atmosphere is of governmental TV, in the late 70s, early 80s. And the acting is on a par with the passionate village association theater troupe."
tt6150576,"Six and a half stars. It offers a window into current-day urban Japan, and it's refreshing to look at a culture that has some distinctive quirks and retains some autonomy from the western value system. The series is well led by Kaoru Kobayashi, the Master cook and owner of the diner and its central character, who provides a friendly and steadying influence on his unsettled, sometimes silly clientele. Some are regulars, while a sequence of others provide the changing story line in each new episode. Unfortunately the stories felt too lightweight to me, and the characters lacked depth. It's just appealing enough to keep watching."
tt6150576,Great short stories that showcase each person's heart and mind.
tt6150576,Japanese styled Chicken Soup for Soul (real life version).
tt6150576,All I'll say is this. Don't watch them all too soon. Because when you have finished the last episode... it's over.
tt10183988,"This can be a bit cheesy at times but this is one of those shows that makes you feel good inside and makes you smile and cry. The acting & writing were spot on and you honestly care about these characters and want to see them happy. The music is so much fun and every single song makes you feel something....happy, sad, inspired... This ensemble are so talented and the premise is really cute. I really hope there is another season. I just finished watching the entire season and I honestly can say that I'm fighting putting it on again. Bravo to all involved. Wardrobe, lighting, writing, audio, acting, set design (and others), you all did a fantastic job."
tt10183988,"I watched this with my kids because I knew some people that show up as extras in the band scenes. However, I was pleasantly surprised by it. I am not its target audience but I could still enjoy it and I think it is a good story with some great messages for kids."
tt10183988,"Rating: 9/10Themes: Drama, High School, Ghosts, Romance, Music, Friendship, Family, Lgbtq+, Loss, Bully & Humour.Top five characters: 1) Luke Patterson, 2) Alex Mercer, 3) Reggie Peters, 4) Julie Molina and 5) Jay Molina."
tt10183988,"So, I just happened to see this up on Netflix this morning, and I was bored and really had nothing else to watch, so I said ""I'll give this one episode, it's rated G and is a musical, so I'm not expecting much"".
.......
And, i just finished binging the whole damn thing! Let me just say that forget the fact that it's a 'kids' show for a minute, it doesn't really feel like it when you're watching it. The original music, dancing and acting were some of the best I've seen from Netflix (or anywhere else in recent memory if I'm being completely honest).
I'm 44 years old. And I LOVED this show. I've actually downloaded the soundtrack as well, and it's pretty freaking awesome!If you're looking for something that the whole family can watch together and actually ENJOY together, you really ought to give this one a try. I think, like me, you'll be incredibly surprised.I can't NOT give this one a 10/10. It truly deserves it."
tt10183988,"I'll start with the fact that I'm 64. I stumbled across this yesterday while getting ready to watch something else and was, slightly, intrigued. When my teen daughter came out to see what I was watching I described it as a kind of High School Musical kind of show, by the very talented Kenny Ortega. I was already 3 episodes in. I just finished the last episode. And I gotta tell ya, it just kept getting better with each one. Yeah, it's a little cheesy, but some cheese is good. The music was pretty great! The last episode ended with a cliffhanger and I just said ""what?? That can't be it!"" And looked to see if a 2nd season has been ordered. It hasn't, but im gonna keep hoping for it, because I can't wait to see how this plays out!!Good entertainment for the whole family."
tt10183988,"The 7+ rating on this show shouldn't turn anyone older than that age away. This show is amazing!The general premise: a musical band of boys from 1995 die and become ghosts in the year 2020. They're able to communicate with one living girl and when performing music with her, they're able to be seen by other people.This show is about losing loved ones, growing up, making & honoring friendships, respecting others and their emotions and of course some awesome music!The actors are really great-- something that is often missing from the genre of 'kids shows'. The writing&script is good. The set designs and camera work is good. The music is good, the dancing is good.There's a blended family and some LGBT characters. The diversity is handled very respectfully and authentically. At no point did I feel baited.The only thing this show is missing is a promise of a season 2."
tt10183988,I watched it all in one day. I wasn't going into this thinking it would be this good but it was really good. It was heartwarming at times and although could be cheesy it was still really good! The music is amazing and really catching I downloaded the album as soon as I finished the show. Really good to watch and might even make you cry.
tt10183988,"I loved this show much I watched the whole season in a day!! That's saying something. It's a feel good, funny, emotional, and romantic show that just makes you feel good. Truly a very ""high school musical"" like show. The music is great let me add. Great for teens or preteens and family friendly. LOVE!"
tt10183988,"I just started watching today and I'm in love. These characters are so relatable and yet so unique at the same time. Like, I said, I started watching it today and in between my crazy amount of work, I managed to already watch 6 episodes back to back. I think its fantastic and am on the edge of my seat. I think it is also cool that I noticed Cheyenne Jackson, Jadah Marie, and Booboo Stuart and all from the descendants franchise along with the director/producer Kenny Ortega. Also that Owen Joyner and Savannah Lee May worked together in Knight Squad. It's amazing to see different cast mates working together again."
tt10183988,"I loved every minute of it! So emotional and yet so uplifting! I cried, laughed and loved the songs! Its so good Ive watched it 3 times and downloaded the album. Loved it! Waiting for season 2"
tt10183988,"I came across this show on Netflix the other day while deciding what to watch. I started watching it and was amazed at how good it was. I thought the storyline was great and the actors were fantastic! I was totally amazed at how Netflix was able to turn three teenagers into ghosts. I also loved the fact that this was made by Kenny Ortega, because I loved what he did with the high school musical movies. Once I started watching it, I wanted to watch it again and again. The music in this show is so good that I downloaded the album the minute after I watched it the first time. This is the kind of show that is good for families to watch, or by yourself. I'm in my 30s and I have watched this show three times already!"
tt10183988,I really wish there had been more episodes. I just keep watching the one season over when I need uplifting. Great music and great energy!!!
tt10183988,I watched all 9 episodes the day it came out on Netflix. I love this show! I am constantly rewatching the performances. The singers have amazing voices and the story line is pretty great. I'm really hoping for a second season with a lot more episodes.
tt10183988,"Absolutely loved the plot and music of this series made me cry at times, I just can't wait for a second season! Watched it all today and then instantly started looking for when there might be a second season."
tt10183988,Honestly it was so good and I am way too old for the tv show. Normally I wouldn't watch it but the premise intrigued me. The good news is that the show did not dissapoint. Great music as well. I am also glad they found an actress who could actually sing not that nasally annoying voice that most Disney stars have.
tt10183988,"I stumbled across this show completely by accident, and was only intrigued because of the title(I like ghost shows), and I found myself binge watching the whole series. The writers of this show really know how to make you fall in love with the characters and make you want more. I cannot wait for season 2."
tt10183988,"This show brings joy and excitement, it focuses on friendship and innocent crushes yet the music was outstanding. Director Kenny Ortega is amazing, picked a good cast to represent JATP, the song choices were very nice and not too hard on the ear, excited to see what else Season 2 brings us."
tt10183988,"This show was actually very good, with a great story line and even better music!!Okay, it might be hard to continue after the fact that the 'phantoms' are back to life, but they can find a way, cant they?THE SHOW DESERVES A SEASON 2, For real.."
tt10183988,Could be more kid-friendly but not it has good acting as singing yea stuff I disagree with but which shows doesn't know a days. It's a Netkfix movie.
tt10183988,I'm not sure what show those 10/10 watched but this has some proper bad acting combined with utterly predictable characters and storyline. The do have cute young people and ok-ish music if thats what you like.
tt10183988,"This show was something I went into being interested but not expecting too much and I've never been more glad to be wrong!!! It was charming, funny, heartfelt and had INCREDIBLE music!!! I cried both happy and sad tears but every minute was worth it!! I never thought I'd feel so much emotion over a ghost boy band and the chemistry they had with not only each other but also Julie!!! Also I could listen to Cheyenne Jackson sing for hours and Boo Boo Stewart showed really good and emotional acting chops in this too! Kenny Ortega THANK YOU for bringing us this incredible experience!!!!"
tt13487106,"The first episode alone had me dumbstruck. This very human man is a surgeon at the highest level. Redefining what is terminal and what is now just a procedure to fix. We often make the remark, ""if it was 100 years ago, you would be dead"", well there are alot of people alive today who would not be if it was 35 years ago. And all the while as the story goes on we get to see some of just the most amazing operations being carried out. This guy goes into a human being where he then operates on another tiny human being and we can see it all on screen.I will save the rest so you can be as captivated as I was."
tt13487106,"Do not miss this...these days, to me, I sometimes wonder if there is any real goodness left in the human race. This series showcases four exemplary examples. It was very fulfilling to get the full story of how each person came to be who they are today and their dedication to their craft.We need more shows like this."
tt13487106,"Riveting documentary that does an incredible job of revealing the deep passion, skills and appreciation that these four surgeons share about their careers. Hope there are more episodes to come."
tt13487106,"I'm in awe. Watching with my mouth dropped to the floor! I can't believe there are such incredible, exceptional, outstanding and brilliant people. Puts ones own life into perspective. Am I doing the best I can? And, how can I do more? Really impressive series. A real eye opener. Thank you Surgeons."
tt13487106,"Really fascinating to see heroes at work.
I'm impressed with the amazing surgeons work.
I feel privileged to get so close to them.
Thank Netflix!"
tt13487106,Absolutely amazing documentary. Highly recommended as a family docuseries.
tt13487106,Story of each surgeon amazing . It is not boring at all and it is out of the box documentary
tt13487106,"Brilliant! Jaw dropping, inspirational, incredible and amazing
Highly recommend this series.
It brings a beautiful story to this amazing surgeons.
The brain Surgeon's story was so well portrayed. The parallel story telling of his road to America working as a migrant fatmer to being one of the top brain surgeon at Mayo Clinic is fascinating."
tt13487106,Shame that it's only 4 episodes because these episodes are truly amazing! These doctors and their lives are just incredible and I wish to see more stories about surgeons. There are lots series about killers why not about people who save lives?
tt13487106,"I found the medical side completely enthralling and fascinating. I personally thought that the filler, the inane social justice (typical Netflix) drivel in the form of the background information on the surgeons was at times overbearing and unnecessary. For me personally, it didn't really enhance or flesh out the show and just drew me away from the more interesting medical content.All in all its worth a watch"
tt13487106,"Being a physician myself watched it and can watch hundreds of times more.
Especially in episode 1,the professor is a living miracle."
tt13487106,"Not enough medical and surgery viewing and and too much about the background of his life. The surgery parts was class, but it goes on a bit too much about his upbringing. Fair play to the bloke though. Very inspiring."
tt13487106,An amazing inside look at how different surgeries take place
tt13487106,"I have used IMDB extensively since many years! Never have I written a review! This documentary is so good that I am writing one!Documentaries can be not as entertaining as other content. But, this one had a good mix of story and showing a new surgical aspect in each episode. I loved the 1st and 4th episodes. They showcase the story of each surgeon, their passion and it gave me a whole new perspective on medical field (I am from engineering!). It is a must watch and after watching this, this will stay in your mind for some time for sure!Give it a try! Do not miss it!"
tt13487106,It's so amazing!!! you can truly understand how surgeons save lives!!!!
tt13487106,Amazing look into the world of a surgeon. I found it difficult to watch not so much because of the surgeries but more so because it highlighted the amount of personal hardships people around the world suffer every day no matter where you live or who you are. It was very humbling and I cried many times.
tt13487106,"Brilliant documentary about 4 surgeons and their story, doing an incredible job.
Each story is amazing!
Hopefully, we'll be able to get more of them."
tt13487106,"This look into these surgeons' extraordinary work and touching private lives is absolutely fabulous, well done.As a retired ER RN, of course I was drawn to the medical aspects of this expertly done docuseries. I enjoyed those medical/surgical aspects, which are all shown very well. However, the human aspects about these brilliant doctors is what really makes these shows excellent.I hope Netflix produces more than these 4 episodes!"
tt13487106,"So mind blowing, not just seeing them doing their magic, but looking into their path to professional climax is what gets me. Really well directed, really talented people infront and behind the camera. That's how its done. Perfect perfect perfect. Episode about Dr. Devi Shetty is my personal favorite."
tt13487106,"One of, if not the best docuseries I've seen in my life."
tt13487106,"Absolutely amazing to see Life in the womb.
To see a beautifully formed baby, alive and beautifully formed . Everyone needs to watch this first part.
The rest of documentary has highs and lows.
Life alive in the womb."
tt13487106,Seeing the surgeons at work with their compassionate skills and walking that fine line between life and death daily is truly humbling. It is truly an extraordinary series and the patients re inspiring and the unsung heroes who battle life and death everyday. You get to learn that the surgeons are not alone in this journey and their partnerships and teams are the key to walk patients through their life and death journeys.
tt13487106,"Must watch... Simply speechless
I watched with my wife and keep saying durigg the documentary that this person Mr kypros is the God in earth"
tt13487106,"This series is amazing, and watching it gives me almost the same feeling as going into an OR.
Kypros is definitely an inspiration."
tt13617024,"I've only seen the first two lessons, but as a teacher at an online pagan school where meditation is the foundation of all that follows, i can tell this show is in the right headspace.I've always claimed I can teach someone to meditate in 3 minutes and the first lesson was nearly exactly what I would have taught someone and they took little longer than that.highly recommended for everyone. /guy (silverlocke)"
tt13617024,"The series does what it set out to do as a guide to meditation, so I really have no complaints. From a film-making point of view, the visuals and animation graphics are kept simple, and to the point of what is being narrated on screen in the moment. I went along with the directions of the narrator- close my eyes, focus on the breathing, etc. It seemed to help. So, there."
tt13617024,"Andy Puddicombe is the voice that guided me in Meditation for over 2 years, and occasionally still does when I need a reminder on certain techniques. I can't begin to say how useful it is to this very day. You almost feel born again after practicing these techniques, and wish you knew of them sooner.Headspace has brought immense calm to many people, and now seeing them on a massive platform is exciting, because many more will be opened to this simple yet powerful tool called meditation. These tools have the potential to create a more peaceful, kind, and calm world.
This show has great graphic, great narration, and as always, great techniques from Andy.To end, I'll quote Headspace:
""Traditions may bind us, cultures alienate us, language and words divide us. But in silence, we are united."""
tt13617024,"This is absolutely Brilliant, it's a perfect way to get yourself into meditation. I love the animations, it keeps it engaging and also has a very relaxing tone to every episode. Andy presents the information in a way that anyone can grasp, making it easy to understand. His stories are relatable, and his guidance is much appreciated. I would love to see the show come out with even more seasons. This show is the gift that keeps giving. This is very beneficial in helping with stress and anxieties, and helps to train yourself so no matter what times life brings you, you have a way to help yourself and the people you love. With practice these meditations can bring a lot more peace and balance to your life, I know it does for me."
tt13617024,"I needed this, this guide to peacefulness, and finding the mellow. It's scary and unfortunate how in a hurry to get on with life we are, rarely fully allowing ourselves to just live and appreciate. I am so happy this simple guide to mental health came to a streaming platform such as Netflix. This is progress at work I'm my opinion."
tt13617024,I stumbled upon the headspace podcast through Spotify and fell in love with the style and quality of the advice. It came at the exact right time in my life where I needed to just slow down and practice being aware and present. So pleasant to find a newly released Netflix series as well with beautiful visuals and meditation practice. I've been wanting to practice meditation for a long time and now finally am. The series really is helping mellow me out and be present. I hope it has a long life.
tt13617024,"I have been listening to the tutorial for the last three days before sleeping, and it has been such a calming experience for me. It taught me that in silence we are all united. Coping with stress is a difficult task, and our minds keep spinning. We need a silent moment. Put your headphones on and listen to it before sleeping for twenty minutes top. Trust me, it helps."
tt13617024,"Brilliant content, amazing work on guiding people to meditation. My wife and me are watching these, and the short answer is yes: the exercises are pretty relaxing, some might make you feel sleepy... but it is normal.The design, colors and animations are outstanding. I am looking forward to see more episodes.I am not sure how Andy Puddicombe relates to Jay Shetty, a guy that has some podcasts and wrote a book called Think like a monk.I guess meditation is going to be a huge trend from now on."
tt13617024,"It's a good read upwards but can be a preachy. Meditation, although can be traced back to Buddhism did not originate there. In fact, much of its origins come from non-religious affiliation and this programme (along with many sources) chooses not to cover this topic.Overall, I'd you enjoy meditation and want to take your practice further it is a good watch, but come to it with a level mind and don't buy into the hosts own personal beliefs. The programme provides good advice overall."
tt13617024,"Thank you, I was always angry, sad, anxious, I was surrounded by the stress, and all of that exercise helps me a lot to see my life in an otherside. At the end of each episode I have the feeling to be somewhere else in peace and now I try to keep that way everytime in my life ! (I've tried a lot of meditation guide on YouTube but is the only one who's work with me)"
tt13617024,"Headspace guide to meditation: Only made to increase the popularity of the app, its the same content on app and on netflix. (For People who want to understand)"
tt13617024,Main thing I enjoyed was that I physically felt better (more clear headed and calm) after each practice meditation at the end of the episodes. Really unlike any other show Ive watched. It felt like I was directly increasing the clarity of my mind. I will keep repeating the episodes/practice just for that reason.
tt13617024,Wonderful meditation guidance. Felt better immediately.
tt13617024,"Im in episode 5, and i am loving it.
It had an instant effect in me. Its really worth it.
You can watch an episode a day and finish it in 8 days.
Truly recomend it."
tt13617024,People should try and watch it!i think this dosent take mutch of your time and it intresting to try different methods. Nice!
tt13617024,"I like many others just go through life on auto pilot, then this worldwide pandemic hit. Which jaulted us all into this sence of constant unease and unknowing, I have always felt stressed, like a ball of tightly wound twine, then those two components made my head want to implode. stumbling upon headspace Guide to Meditation on Netflix was just what I needed, the directions are clear and simple with a lovely background or Andy the narrator, has such a soothing voice, plus the animated images are relaxing, I have only watched 3 episodes and feel all that tightness dissolving, I felt a beautiful sense of calm which continued after the actual Meditation. I look forward to watching an episode each day. I urge you to give it a go."
tt13617024,"Fist thing to do when disturbed because of any reason, I know there are other things but the way it guides you to meditate is what you needed. you need someone to be their as a coach to structure your thoughts. And his voice is pro, Andy you rocked"
tt13617024,This TV series helped me a lot to find some peace on my mind! Thank you very much! I'll be waiting for the season 2!
tt13617024,"It's a very interesting, useful, must see documentary, probably was made to boost the popularity of their app. The animation and the music is amazing and entertaining, however the narration isn't my favorite at all. It might be the dialect or the tone of voice (sorry Andy), and I wouldn't care if it wasn't about meditation, but one of the most important aspect to focus on should be the approach of the guide. The narration while doing the practices should be calming and relaxing, but it's rather strange and feel very very forced and makes me annoyed."
tt13617024,"I never thought that I would be saying this, cuz I was skeptical abou this technique that is said to be helpful for managing anxiety and depression. When I tried it for the first time in my life,I was in a very bad mental condition, I was feeling super suci/dal, I had lost a one of my loved ones; which was a year ago from now. Trust me, I thought this was the worst idea ever to even try it but I tried to stick with it, over the course of a month, I started to see physical changes as well as mental changes. It actually started getting better, I WAS GETTING BETTER! I was able to accept the loss of my loved one, I was able to accept that I too, can feel stuff and it's okay. I started to feel grateful to life. Well this is the bright side though, Somedays it actually gets a little harder for me to continue meditation but I still try. It has become a part of my life now. I feel incomplete if I don't do it for several days. I want to says thanks to Andi and the creators of this series, I don't know if you'll ever read it or not, Thank you for helping me to heal myself."
tt13617024,"It provides techniques which can be and are encouraged to be used outside the show also which have helped me be at peace with my mind and circumstances. My anxiety since committing to these techniques has greatly decreased, however mainly my reactivity to things shifted to responsiveness. This show eases people in who are not too familiar with meditation or who like me weren't able to feel 'right' for lack of a better word with other voices and guides on YouTube etc. Highly recommend, anybody I've recommended headspace app or show to who's taken the recommendation into action has expressed great appreciation for this. Whilst some comments call the show preachy, I think if you're watching a show which is a guide to meditation, the show assumes youre open to the guide? If you hadn't clicked on the series then I can understand however within context I think it's Andy showing us his world and techniques through how he has learnt, and lessons are certainly able to be extracted, it's up to the individual to determine what lessons to extrapolate and what to let go, and hopefully the guide will bring more clarity to even this!"
tt13617024,"Heard this world over and over again, really found what it means after viewing the video, thank you for bring back the peaceness into so many soul! God blessed!"
tt13617024,I put an episode on during my dinner break and meditate. Works a treat!
tt13617024,"A 8 part mini series claiming to show how meditation is a or the secret of a happy life.The animation used in every part is superb. Sort of causes the viewer to be put into a hypnotic state.The person behind this series is a former monk who fled to the East to get away from his life. He is not a doctor of any kind.Now I know from living in a buddhist country many of the monks are very unhappy and some are even convicted of extortion and similar crimes.They cannot wait to leave that ""vocation"" as soon as possiible.In essence if a person learns how to do an easy breathing technique (many government health web sites show how to do this) then by using that technique and controlling the thoughts in your mind then it can maybe make you a more contented person.Or- of course -if you have the brilliance to create a self help group making billions by cashing in upon a simple technique, then you too can:Breath....and grow rich!(with thanks to Napoleon Hil)5/10."
tt13433812,"Just finished watching the episode 4. Wow, it was so good. Well made mixture of thriller and comedy.I saw a few negative reviews here written after eps 1 or 2. I recommend watching at least up to eps 3 and 4. The real story starts from eps 3. Eps 4 is like a complete well made movie. You will surely enjoy it."
tt13433812,"You can see the cast had a lot of fun making this Italian/Korean would-be mafia thriller, the sort of fun NOT experienced in Hollywood since the days of Burt Reynolds. Vincenzo contains a very absorbing plot, a cast star-struck by designer clothes, interspersed with Italian (and other) Classical music excerpts to set in relief some well written suspense and intrigue. The plot centers on, if we really are to believe it, the endemically CORRUPT upper echelons of S. Korean society. Is it a coincidence that many of the systemic abuses of power and institutional vice that constitute Vincenzo's Main Plot are now also going on, this very moment in the USA? It is certainly food for thought. A clear advantage this Korean drama has over mediocre US shows, however is a much softer-handed use of violence, resorting more often to satire to keep the plot moving as opposed to gratuitous savagery now so common in so-called ""hit"" US shows. So far, so good, Binjenzo!"
tt13433812,"I've never been one to write reviews on movies or TV shows, but after just finishing Vincenzo, I can't resist the urge to share my thoughts!This show has been such an amusement park and I loved every single second of it! I won't spoil anything, but I'll give my thought on some of the different aspects of the show.The story (10/10):This show grabbed a hold of me within the first minutes. The beginning really set the atmosphere and painted the main character as a cold, calculated and mysterious person. I mean; who does not like a beginning that glues you to the screen right away. I have to be honest and say that I binged the whole show in a week due to the never ending captivity of Vincenzo and the story that unfolds around him. I'm hope I'm not biased, but this show had me from start to finish and for that I have to give the story, a top rating.The characters: (10/10)
As the show goes on, we get to know all the different characters, their personas, their believes and what their values are. All the characters are great and gives the show a perfect balance of excitement, comedy and sadness. I can honestly say that I was just as interested in Vincenzo as I was in the other characters. They all had their story unfold like a present thought out the show.The protagonists were great, the antagonists were very good and all the other side-characters were interesting. What more can you ask for?The music: (10/10)There is nothing more to say than ""Bellissimo!"" The music was used in a perfect manner, the choice of songs at certain moments were spot on and they really gave the show a good feeling of Italian and Korean. Much respect the the people who worked on the music for this show.This might seem like a very biased review, but I still can't shake the feeling I'm left with, now that I've finished the show. I want to watch it again! I want to experience the opening sequence, I want to hear the music and I want to see how it ends all over again! Brilliant show! Just brilliant! If you haven't watched it, then do it! I promise you won't regret it. I laughed, I cringed, I cried and I enjoyed my way thought this masterpiece! I hope you will do the same.If you've read this far, then I thank you for reading my thoughts about this show. Leave a like if you enjoyed reading about my extravagant experience with Vincenzo!"
tt13433812,"To the people claiming that the characters are overacting; this is a COMEDY. And an excellent slapstick one at that. The show really picks up pace after episode 4, and it doesn't stop - the twists and turns are endless. Not a lot of kdramas can keep my attention for the whole run, but this definitely takes the cake for suspense, drama and the laughs. Take it for what it is, a slick and gloriously over the top kdrama."
tt13433812,Slow start but it's getting much better. Episode 4 was really good! A shocking surprise I did not expect at the end. I'm truly looking forward to the next episode.
tt13433812,"I love Vincenzo. Best Korean show made. And, I watch many Korean shows and I'm American. Please, Pease make a second season and more. I'm hooked. It's funny, yet the story line keeps you on your toes awaiting the next show. I see this as an alternative to American James Bond. Love the characters. The two main characters love connection is very spot on. Romantic, funny, comical, yet real. Just all around great story line. Love it love it. I could see many seasons of their quirky show and relationship solving crimes for many seasons to come.."
tt13433812,It is the best drama I have ever seen after descendants of the sun.....song joong ki looks fabulous....jeon yeo bin's acting is also mind blowing....it is a full fun package... really worth watching...I will give it a 10/10...
tt13433812,"It's such an amazing show and I don't understand why most people are criticizing it without giving it a chance. Maybe if you have the patience and watch past episode 3 then you will fully understand what the show is about. Trust, I was turned off with the first 3 episodes but once episode 4 started, I was literally glued to it. Just give it a chance. This is one of the best Kdrama's I've watched (coming from someone who is a kdrama fanatic). If you're not used to kdrama's and their comedy then I don't think it's for you. But don't leave a bad review without even giving it chance. If you watch past episode 3 then you will fall in love trust me."
tt13433812,"Song Joong-ki's performance in this series is just incredible. Definitely matched or even outshined by Jeon Yeo-bin's performance. One of the most distinctive characters I have ever seen in my life. Shows how much work Jeon Yeo-bin put into the role. This series is so amazing thanks to the balanced give and take flow of the battle between the 2 fighting forces. Super funny and unexpected reveals about the characters makes this series unmatched. It's just surprisingly superb. Plus, you'll definitely love the vigilante side to it. It is so relevant to today's flood of corruption and crime around the world. This series will satisfy your hunger for everything you ever dream to see in a drama. A must watch!!!"
tt13433812,"A feel good Italian mafia comedy is hard to come by. Let alone a Korean one.To feel good the good guys had to win. All the time. But such is not the case here. There are lots of death here. Very calculated. And many fight scenes, albeit simplified and comedic. Together with a fairly sizeable support cast. And most are really one dimensional. Only the 3-4 are somewhat fully fleshed out.The evil ones are really evil. The slimy one stays slimy. The comedy sidekicks also. No one changed a bit except the female lead.And there are loads of side stories. The underling brother, the treasure hunter, the hidden talents, the McGuvin , the tribute to the French Revolution, modern dance, Italian food, and even the pigeon gets to be hero for a day.It's entertaining, but this is just pass your time tv drama, at its best."
tt13433812,"Great actors. Today, watching episode 8 I laugh like crack. It's really a great new kind of plot and has a lot of funny moments!!! Love it. I'm anxious to see the final episode but at the same time I will not want it to end!😳 Happened to me before with some dramas, recently, specially StarUp and Hospital Playlist. But this one is over the edge as of now."
tt13433812,"OMG!!! The way episode 4 ended. If they can continue this pace, action and thrill, it'd be one of the best thriller K-Drama ever made..."
tt13433812,It's quite an interesting show with dark comedy. Definetly not stupid like someone commented. If you don't like it don't watch it or bother commenting.
tt13433812,You'll be enrage to be a mafia too. It super excellent and very promising actors and actresses too.
tt13433812,"I've actually been clapping my hands with glee at the little in jokes (diehard food and coffee snob from Italy, trying and enjoying Korean instant coffee) and character development choices (no references here as I don't want to give any games away). Edit: I loved, loved, loved the reverse trope in the clothing shop!!!Still not sure if I'm enjoying the idea that you can only beat bad guys with an even bigger bad guy (as that seems antithetical to a number of the main character ideals) but overall the writing and plot twists are done well. Further edit after series completed: Definitely gets much darker, but makes you think and laugh and gasp along the way, so highly recommended!"
tt13433812,"I have pushed through the first 2-3 slow episodes, it's now getting better at episode 4.It would be so much more enjoyable if they comedy parts weren't so forced and cringe.But I do like most the characters especially the MC and the fake italian chef."
tt13433812,It veered from cornball humour to some serious violence. It never made any pretence to being realistic so turn your brain off and enjoy the ride. Silly but quite bingeable.
tt13433812,"I kept watching until the ninth episode on the advice of the comments here that the series gets better as it progresses
Then I got tired of it, it got worse and worse.Short and to the point, I think it's an idiotic, childish series.The humor is theatrically stupid.The main character is unreal, the lawyer, with all her exaggerated movements and manners, is downright idiotic.The rest of the characters apparently have intellectual disabilities.So I give it the lowest possible score."
tt13433812,"This is an exceptional series. I enjoyed everything about it... acting, storyline, cinematography. I particularly enjoyed the campy, and occasionally corny portions that were uniquely delightful and entertaining. It had an added sense of pathos, tenderness, and positive versus negative."
tt13433812,"This show has the best of everything. It has action, comedy, just the right amount of romance, and incredible characters. You even find yourself loving the villain because the actor is that good. Jang Han-Soek and Vincenzo are great because they are both villains. There is no real good guy or bad guy. I'll be looking for other shows these actors are in because I was really blown away. 10/10. Do yourself a favor and watch this show."
tt13433812,"This so far with just two episodes is the best start to a series i think I've seen, great actors and writing which is where series are made.Great chemistry between the characters and no flaws in the story so far it appears set up for 20 episodes which is a tough test for KD to do without foolish plots but so far this is fantastic.
Kim Yeo-Jin is building a hell of a resume for herself with many great series
it does take about 15 min of background in Italy then it moves along quite well"
tt12458172,"The best thing I like about Wuxia dramas is the beautiful fight scenes and intricate martial arts choreography. The background in this drama is a bit fake (due to low budget?) but the fight scenes are awesome. I've really enjoyed watching Wen Kexing fighting with martial arts masters like Zhao Jing, Mo Huaiyang and Ye Baiyi; he looks really cool when showcasing his self-taught kung fu.Gong Jun portrayed the deep-minded, innocent and cruel Master of the Ghost Valley Wen Kexing very well. Wen Kexing is a moody person and the interchanging of emotions is difficult to act but Gong Jun nailed it (e.g. One second he is happy and the next second he is angry). Wen Kexing is cruel but has a kind heart. He wants to avenge his murdered parents but he has never harmed any innocent people. I like watching his gentle interactions with beautiful A Xiang and Chengling.Gong Jun and Zhou Ye are the best-looking artists in this drama. :-)"
tt12458172,"There are several points for an 9 star review but first, I'll explain why not a 10 star review: because of the camera work and sound design. I don't know if the director (or directors?) had a not so great camera team operator because in some scenes you can see the way the camera shakes and it's not consistent with the feeling of the scene. Although I understand why the sound design needed to be covered by the BGM because of the loud exterior sounds of other productions that happened in the same place and at the same time, there's no enough digetic sound to give more dimensionality to the overall picture. With dubbing it's another issue that I don't have right to make criticism.However, why 9 stars? Because even though it was a low budget production, it doesn't feel like one. It's obvious the production knew their weaknesses and their strengths and exploited both of them.The first thing I applaud is the script. The script writer was debuting in this work, and already had done a excellent job of conveying the substancial (romantic) relationship of ZZS and WKX. It is not at all surprising that both GJ and ZZH were able to demonstrate good acting skills here, because the script worked on their behalf.The second thing is the plot, although it falls into varied exhibition dialogues (understandable, because after all it is in television format), is interesting enough to be able to continue watching and waiting for the next episode. Besides, the cast doesn't fall behind; although not everyone is at the level of the skill of ZZH or the other veteran actors, they stand in their own enough to show a convincing performance.And the last thing: the fight scenes. In the first episodes those aren't too great because of the edited slow motion, but later in the ongoing episodes, the fights have improved a lot, so much so that they give me adrenaline.From a point of a viewer who has not seen many Chinese dramas, this series is quite recommended to enter the world of wuxia stories. Please love this serie! By the way, you can find the free episodes 1-10 at Youku channel."
tt12458172,"Wen Kexing stole the show. This role was so successful and popular because Gong Jun interpreted it very well and immersed himself in the role. WenKexing is a multi-faceted and complex character. How Gong Jun handled the switching between kindness and cruelty is spot-on. WenKexing is a classic role and will forever be in the hearts of the audience.On the other hand, I am confused by the blank stare acting of Zhou Zishu. It is odd and illogical for an immoral former leader of an assassination organization to act like a saint after he left the organization. It is either due to poor script or poor acting. This character is a turn-off for me and therefore I couldn't give this drama a 10-star."
tt12458172,"Word of Honor is a wuxia drama, based on Priest's novel named Tian Ya Ke. It means you will see many martial arts scenes, everything will satisfy you emotionally. I guarantee it.The characters Zhou Zishu and Wen Kexing, which are the leading roles, are very skillfully written and acting in the same way. You can see how much the actors attach importance to their roles in their acting. Zhang Zhehan, who portrays a character like Zhou Zishu, who is desperate but has found hope in the last years of his life but has limited time ve Gong Jun, who portrays a character like Wen Kexing, who lived his life in a dark/insane place and still one of his part a little child, both of lead actors... THEY SHOW INCREDIBLE ACTING!! I think the reason i love this drama so much is that every relationship is so deep. Zhou Xu/Wen Kexing, Wen Kexing/Gu Xiang, Zhou Xu/Cheng Ling. All of them is so pure and the acting is so good that it feels as if you are experiencing all those emotions. Not just the lead roles, all the actors/actress are like your best friend.One of my favorite things about Word of Honor is definitely cinematography. They make you feel like the camera is your eyes. The arrival of daylight, the positioning of the actors, everything is to make you feel as if you are living there, and you feel that too. It will be a festival for your eyes and heart.The production team gave their best to this drama. If you are watching a Chinese drama for the first time, it may be difficult to notice but I, as someone who has been here for 6 years, can see how much effort they have made for this drama. If I'm not mistaken, there are subtitles in 13 languages right now, and they do everything to give viewers comfort.There is a lot to say but I did my best to make this spoiler free. It will leave a mark in your life, you can be sure of that."
tt12458172,"I often just watch highlights of a series, especially Chinese series cause many them of have such a large number of episodes with a lot of filters. However, each episode in this series is quite dense with plot details and forshadowings. Actions scenes has good choreography and stays true to its genres. The two leads portray their character spendidly, especially through their eyes and microexpressions. They also performed most of the action scenes themselves. The supporting charactors also have interesting backstories. Dispite the limited budget, the crews has delivered a high quality series with a lot of hearts in it."
tt12458172,"I think this drama is the best adaptation of Chinese novels in recent years. It interprets the love of two boys in the period of ancient Chinese knights. The two mutual salvation dramas contain many classic expressions of love in China and the world. There is no direct expression of love in the play, but the love expressed by the eyes gestures of the two actors can make you want to stop."
tt12458172,"The screenwriter is a genius. You will be surprised to see how she plays with words, how she gives it deep meanings, and that she can tell a very deep story even with a simple sentence. Her name is Xiao Chu. I will definitely remember this name."
tt12458172,"This is the best wuxia series I saw in recent years.The relationship between the main actors is romantic and delicate. You can tell by every words they say and every expression they make. I can feel the spark and its change between them. It uses a lot of Chinese poetries and articles. If you can speak Chinese, you will feel the power and the beauty of the ancient sentences that they talk to each other. If not it's okay too, Youku made their best to provide the translation in 13 languages on Youtube.The editor made a very complex Zhou Zishu. And Zhang Zhehan (portray ZZS) plays really well. This character is changing all the time as the story goes. And Wen Kexing is also changing inside as he interacts with his soulmate Zhou Zishu. The eye acting of Gong Jun (portray WKX) is very attractive. They both had the dark history that they don't want to touch. But along with each other, they find the new meaning of life. Besides the main characters, there're a lot deep and lifelike characters as well. You will be touched by even a bit part. The acting and the story is very enjoyable!Also, the composition looks typically Chinese-elegent. As a wuxia drama, the martial art is graceful, flexible and diverse. In different scenes you will have different feelings.Although the film editing and effects are not perfect, and I know the budget is limited, I still love and highly recommend this drama."
tt12458172,"Didn't think another drama could surpass ""The Untamed,"" but this one surely is on par with if not even one notch higher. With some of the most breathtaking cinematography and camera angles, a clever script--poetic, subtle, and crisp yet never draggy--combined with excellent main leads who literally bring the characters to live before the viewer's eyes, and a superb supporting cast, beautifully choreographed martial arts moves...WOW! I'm again blown away by this wonderful drama. No one is perfect here. It's a love story, a story of atonement and redemption, it is so many things neatly wrapped up in scenes that take us into their world and hearts. We feel their pains, their joy, their triumphs. The two main leads who carry the weight of portraying the BL arc are simply eye candy and exuded such charisma and chemistry that I'm completely swooned by them, and I'm not even gay. I'm only on episode 12 and can hardly wait for the next episode to air. Fingers-crossed that they will have a happy ending. Please don't leave it open to interpretation. I'm watching it in its original language and hope the translations will do this wonderful production justice."
tt12458172,"This show is by no means bad. Plenty of characters crossing blades, politics, intrigues and romantic drama. The story is nothing too fancy with lots of familiar elements, but nonetheless an unexpected twist or two. It is not overflown with magical or mythical elements and therefore somewhat more 'mundane', which makes it a little more relatable than comparable shows.It does, unfortunately, also have some flaws. The relationship between the two main characters is hard to grasp. This ""kinship of soulmates"" seems supposed to be more than friendship, but even without any graphic innuendos some scenes made me feel like I was watching Chinese Brokeback Mountain. The ""lost memory""-reason to explore ones story and history seemed a little uncreative and some of the dramatic turns a tad too artificial. The fact that many of the requisites and backgrounds look obviously painted and lots of the studio settings re-used 1:1 without any rearrangements (i.e. The ""plateau"") is a little sad, because the rest of the cinematography left a rather decent impression.Overall I found the show to be decently entertaining, but definitely not as overwhelmingly positive as some of the reviews here might suggest. It's nice to watch, but not memorable enough to revisit again at a later point of time."
tt12458172,I think we can all agree that this darama is extremely addictive and each episode gets better and better than the last
tt12458172,"Chinese Drama 'Word of Honor' was interesting at first, quickly, however, changed sides.The drama starts strong, with the introduction to the world, the mystery in hand, the political powers as well as the characters. The mystery element was pretty intriguing and even the villains seemed twisty and shady. However, after the first part, the drama took a more domestic turn, opting for a slice of life focus, forgetting about the matter in hand, adding a few specs of the characters' past here and there and pretty much letting them play little house on the prairie for a big chank of time. The villains were toned down too, and the main one was simply too tamed to be that horrific bad guy who will keep things interesting. The ending, finally, was rushed, but emotional, especially since the second couple was the main source of entertainment in the second half.So, overall, 5.5 out of 10."
tt12458172,"Saw the first episode and tried very hard to finish it. Why are the guys dress and act like women? It is very difficult to tell the characters apart as they all dress and look similarly. And that one young woman sidekick is just annoying as hell. Whoever wrote this just invented garbage like the nails. Same old lines and cliches copied from Hong Kong series but somehow it just makes no sense and felt like a teenager wrote the story. It is definitely not authentic wuxia series, and instead it is just mix and match parts from Hong Kong shows. The very worst part is the story which is very forced and lack emotions or any substance. Very shallow and poorly done."
tt12458172,Everything is too good to be described with words ❤ Highly recommend!
tt12458172,"I was almost throwing up when I watched the first episode. It was confusing and the acting was too exaggerated. I wanted to give up but was persuaded by a friend to give it a chance. I fast forward a lot to get to the parts that I found ,ore interesting. I am glad I gave it a chance as the actors that came after were much better. I enjoyed the interactions between Wen Kexing and Guxiang. They were boss and maid, and yet get along more like brother and sister. Guxiang's wedding was a scene that deeply touched me. We KeXing did everything to make it a beautiful wedding, however, the so-called ""righteous"" people made it a killing field. It's so similar to the world we live in. Unscrupulous people work to destroy other's reputation and hard work for their own pleasure and use ""justice"" and ""righteousness"" to camouflage their own interests. It's worth reflecting the plot of this drama."
tt12458172,My fave of the year so far and I think its going to stay like that!!! Just love it I'm gripping my chair just waiting for more episodes and the wait kills meeeee!!!!! Want to know more but at the same time don't want it to endd
tt12458172,"To me, one of the most attractive aspects of period dramas is the looks of the main actors and actresses. The male lead Wen Kexing (played by Simon Gong Jun) and female lead Gu Xiang (played by Zhou Ye) passed my test! They both are very good looking and have good acting skills.I almost gave up this drama when watching the first episode. The guy who played Zhou Zishu is unflattering; he has only one expression and the distance between his eyes is unusually narrow. I was turned off by his constant staring acting. It was so boring to watch this dude killing innocents and then became a beggar.The turning point was the Ghost Valley scene. Wen Kexing, the Master of Ghost Valley, caught my attention when he came out near the end of the first episode. His intimidating aura makes people shudder. He looks super cool in the red outfit and with heavy makeup.When Gu Xiang was with Wen Kexing, they were so lively. A Xiang called Wen Kexing her master but the two are more like brother and sister. I enjoyed watching these two beautiful characters' interactions and how they became each other's light."
tt12458172,I haven't been this insane for a tv drama over 10 years. Thanks for all the beauty and touched feelings it brings to me. I ship WEN and Zhou forever!!!!!!!
tt12458172,"This is a great movie I've ever seen
Beautiful actors, professional, beautiful scenes, elaborate staged"
tt12458172,"This is one of those unusual instances where a TV drama adaptation is actually better than the original novel...and managed to pass China's strict media censorship with its obvious LGBT contents (we'll get to that later).""Word of Honor"" is adapted from a BL internet novella called ""A Tale of the Wonderers,"" written by Priest. It's a story of bad boy meets bad boy (crazy ghost lord + dying assassins leader). They ended up together because the crazy one just wouldn't leave the dying one alone. The two ran into heroes who turned out to be eviler than themselves...and thus began their mystery-solving/treasure- hunting/child-raising adventure together.While the two MCs in the novel were interesting, the scriptwriter for ""Word of Honor"" created a juicier adaptation by adding depth and dimension to All the characters. The writer also exceeded audiences' expectation by expanding the original short novel with intriguing new storylines and character interactions. For example, the relationships between young disciple (played by Sun Xi Lun) and his surrogate dads (male leads Gong Jun and Zhan Zhe Han) offered comic reliefs that were unexpectedly endearing at times.I'm pleasantly surprised by the performances of newcomers Gong Jun and Zhou ye (male lead Wen Ke Xing and his mischievous servant girl Gu Xiang). Both did outstanding jobs in bringing their emotionally charged characters to life. Furthermore, the chemistry between Gong Jun and Zhan Zhe Han (main lead #2) is actually more sizzling than most male-female couples on screen. There are many not-so-subtle flirting, lingering looks, physical contacts, and romantic poetic references between the male leads in almost every episode. I'm truly amazed at how ""Word of Honor"" is able to pass China's censorship that generally treats LGBTQ contents as ""immoral."" Nevertheless, I'm very grateful that WOH hadn't been yanked off TV network like its predecessors ""Guardian"" (another novel by Priest) and ""Addicted"".Whether it's a tale of pugilistic adventure about romantic or brotherly love, I think most viewers will find some elements in WOH that are worthy of binge watching."
tt12458172,"If they were allowed to make a drama that portrays same-sex relationships realistically, this would have been a much better story. Unfortunately, that type of story would not have passed censorship.The story has way too many characters, yet the main leads aren't three-dimensional enough to drive the plot forward. The acting is just that, acting. At no point did it seem like the actors had embodied their characters, as if they existed in that world all along. The relationships felt contrived, sometimes exaggerated or underwhelming.The nail in the coffin was when Wen Kexing was explaining the background story about his relationship with Ah Xiang. Those lines were lifted straight out of Ever Night. Maybe it was done as a tribute, but still. In either case, I would rather re-watch Ever Night than to continue watching Word of Honour."
tt12458172,"I really love this beautiful drama
the story is great and the protagonists are great wenzhou are so cute love them
I really recommend this drama"
tt12458172,"The plot is tight, the characters are lovable, the costumes are beautiful. This is my first cdrama, and I am loving every bit of it! I just love all the interactions the characters have! The actors are also very expressive and you can tell their emotions or hidden emotions from their little expressions. I am definitely going to read the novel after the season is over!
Only 11 episodes have been released so far when I am writing this review, but some of my favorite moments revolve around the two main characters' (Wen Ke Xing and Zhou Zhi Shu) interactions with Cheng Ling whom they dote on and protect like their son! So adorable! Definitely give this drama a try!"
tt12458172,"I will absolutely replay this drama again and again! So in love with the chemistry between the leading roles, Zhou Zishu and Wen Kexing! Can they make another more drama like this? If yes, I definitely support this two actors to work together!"
tt15289042,"This is about as close to perfect as a series gets. The character development, scenery, chemistry, fluid movement through eras, interweaving of historical events, beautiful score and satisfying ending were all done with such grace.I eventually put my phone down and actually just watched the my television screen exclusively. And that never happens!As someone who split from their first love as a teenager, yet came to be in a long-term relationship with them over twenty years later, I can attest to the fact that this certainly DOES happen. Sometimes the way by which you find each other again is odd. Coincidences in life certainly do happen; we see evidence of this every day.For me, in the long run, my second chance didn't last more than a few years. However, until we met again, it always felt like unfinished business to me. Splitting the second time, on my own terms, gave me a sense of closure finally. I could stop wondering ""what if"".Sadly, due to circumstance, only one half of our couple had to wonder ""what if"". It's torture enough to go through, but I can't even fathom knowing that you are the only one experiencing it. I won't give away any spoilers here. We all have past loves, past friendships, and past experiences that all create the foundation for who we are as people. It's what makes us ""US"". First Love takes you on that journey for this couple so succinctly and effortlessly.Just know that this series is not only binge-worthy, but it's even put-your-phone-down worthy. And that's saying something."
tt15289042,"Great story with great song, great actor and I love the way how the director connect all different timeline by years and present the past to the audience.I have been growing up with this famous classic Japanese song from Utada Hikaru and I am so happy that they create this art-piece based on the story of the songs, and i believe that it would be great before watching it.I think the young actor and actress also did very well which my memory of first love also flashback during watching it. Love the last two sections which may me cry.Thank you Netflix for producing such amazing series to me!"
tt15289042,"I loved it.It's a beautiful, heartbreaking, and an excellent series.I rarely give 10s on a first view, but I have to say that I absolutely loved this series.Everything is amazing - Story, Main Leads, Their Chemistry, Acting, Star Cast, Background Score, Music.I completed this series in 1 days and I am suffering from Post Drama Syndrome now. I can't get over it. Fabulous love story.It is so moving that I found myself shedding a couple of tears everytime it was on.If you're looking to see what true, real love and dedication/effort is, then this is the show for you. Will never forget."
tt15289042,"I Just finished binge-watching this series on Netflix and I must say it is a breathe of fresh air for me! This is my first time actually seeing a Japanese drama, I am more on watching Japanes animes be it love story, action or fantasy. But this one, I REALLY LOVE! I love how realistic the storyline, their acting are on point and anyone can relate with series! Love the places featured as well!It's just kinda sad that it's only 9 episode and 1 season only. I feel like I want MORE!Two thumbs up! More stories like this that everyone can relate to.Kudos to all the cast and writer of the series!"
tt15289042,"First Love is perfection! The storytelling is fantastic. This film is so much more than a story about a true love beginning in youth. This drama is one of a kind, using amazing storytelling, weaving a beautiful story by bringing us back to where it began and forward to where it is today with such ease and excellence. This series is the best I've watched all year, and I've watched a lot! Every main character is so well written and authentic. The story develops at such a pace that you develop a true affinity with the characters. Nominations and awards belong to the lead Actor and Actress, the Director, the Writer, Cinematographer, and everyone who worked on this film. We, as the viewers, are blessed by their achievement. Wish I could give it more stars than 10!! Perfection! An amazing first love!"
tt15289042,"If you think it's a TV series about Japanese pure love! ?
Then you may miss a good work.The range he spanned happened to match my age.It's like when I listened to Hikaru Utada's first single 'First Love' when I was a student
From the Fukushima Earthquake in Japan to the current COVID-19 in 2022.When I watch the TV series, it seems that I have gone through these years with the TV series.It describes the bitterness and joy encountered in half a lifetime of life.No matter how hard the day is, always face it with a smile.And silently holding back tears behind his back.It describes the strength of women and the greatness of mothers.These processes are also everyone's first time.A choice made out of love.The performance of the story also hopes that everyone can be like the leading actor in the end.Able to overcome their difficulties.Boldly do something for yourself that may change the rest of your life."
tt15289042,"The Japanese drama ""First Love"" based on the classic song ""First Love"" by Hikaru Utada has become a phenomenon-level drama at the end of this year. It has caused topics all over Asia and being the top ten international rankings of Netflix's non-English content. It is a rareJapanese drama in recent years that has started so many discussions: The storyline seems a bit ordinary and even consists of old fashion elements like amnesia, long distant love, poor daughter-in law etc, all these things are so predictable but why is it still so attractive? At the very beginning, the high altitude overhead shot on the big roundabout is a metaphor for our life. We always miss what we missed out like our first love. That can explain why people are so indulged in this drama as the lost is the most cherished.Two songs First Love and Automatic together with the mints, ice cream sodas, and CD player appeared in the play being the strongest collective memories of my generation. I'm impressed about the delicate shooting skills, the visual arts are amazing too!"
tt15289042,"First Love is a must watch for every romance enthusiastic. It had me smiling and tearing up every few minutes.I'm not sure if the show was inspired by Kimi no Na wa (Your Name) but it definitely feels like it at multiple points throughout the show. The story is very similar to Your Name and so is the background score. It was like i was watching a different version of the Anime movie.I found it a little confusing in the beginning, but later realised that the different timelines make the show much better. All you have to do is keep watching.The main story with Yae and Harumichi is beautiful and so are the side characters' storylines. Each character has its own importance in the show's different timelines.Everything blends together very well. None of the episodes felt like long drags like a lot of romantic shows do."
tt15289042,"This is a moving story. The plot is perfectly poised for emotional investment. The actors give it their all. The editing, jumping between timelines, finds resonance for later events that might otherwise have been less involving.Unfortunately the actors portraying the key characters at different ages bear little resemblance to each other, With constant switching between timelines this lack of similarity can jar a little. However, the story garners sufficient investment for this to be less of an issue than it might have been.The final episode did not quite generate the emotional response that all that had gone before appeared to have justified. I cry easily at a good romantic weepie, but shed no tears here. Perhaps this is because the ending was over-engineered for tears. A simpler approach might have allowed the emotional weight of the series to flow naturally through to the end.Despite such quibbles, this is a moving and involving series. If romantic weepies are your thing I have no doubt you will enjoy this as I did."
tt15289042,"I loved the calm pace for telling this story, the music, the photography... but I dare you to work in better scripts, with no memory loss cliches and the constant effort to create a better and most valuable shows. This again provides scene to the constant gaming for increasing the bets, but it gets lost in a barely credibly story. It all just becomes so rehearsed and fake...this ain't love, this is the misunderstood hero's journey who needs to prove himself through constant suffering. And of course, there's the unreachable maiden, very far from any attempt of happiness.No.You have the budget, amazing actors and great scenarios, you just need to work in better and new stories.I'll say this is good for watching while eating. Very relaxing, for those who don't look to be impressed."
tt15289042,I have to say this series is one of the best Netflix ever aired especially if you're into love and Asian drama. It's written beautifully and pictured in simplicity with artistically picture and warm tones. The series not that long but the story getting more interesting and interesting in every episode. Onion ninja almost got me in the 2 last episodes and I strongly suggest you to watch it! Though the series going back forth between timeline but it all beautifully connected. The background OST is also amazing. One of the best Asian hits in 2000's by Utada Hikaru. I really surprised that main character is French descendant. She is really pretty. You're always gonna be the one best J-Drama in my life ever!
tt15289042,"Great cast, genuine performances, usually I watch others types of series this is the first Japanese serie but I can say was totally worthy. The scenario was light and daily related, we can se the snow, sea, mountain and the ordinary traffic. And that plus the acting and the history makes you wanna keep watching.**And now some not requested thoughts:For me was a completely immersion in real human emotions and actions, we are not wise or inspiring in the one third of ours life, we make huge mistakes and unfortunately we always hurt the loved ones because they are the souls around us seeing ours learnings and growing moments. But that is no excuse to keep failing. Is never too late to apologize and try again, try our best for the people we care, like or love."
tt15289042,"Binge watched Japanese drama
'First Love'Inspired from songs by Hikaru Utada, It's a slow-burn romantic drama.Simple story presented in swoon-worthy, heartwarming, heart-touching way.Writer-director Yuri Kanchiku beautifully narrates the screenplay.Each episode is like a connecting pieces of puzzle, which makes it immersing, intriguing and interesting.Each small detail in storytelling is so important, Even small dialogues, activities and objects play important part..
Each action of a character is beautifully presented, why he/she took such decision, which gives depth to characters.Series has perfect casting, specially lead couple, their older and younger versions.Their acting is enthralling. Chemistry is top-notch.It not only narrate dynamics of a couple in different life stages but also relation of mother-daughter, friends, mother-son n siblings.Drama has beautiful OSTs, breathtaking visuals, specially in the last episode has Icelandic scenery.I find myself shedding tears in each episode. Truly heartfelt for me."
tt15289042,"What a well directed and scripted this series was! Big budgeted, great story and stellar performances from all actors/actresses. A nine episodes of emotional roller coaster. You have to see it for yourself to enjoy this beautiful series.The song ""First Love"" by Hikaru Utada was a massive hit back then in 1999. So no wonder it would left a big impression on writer/director Yuri Kanchiku to make this beautiful series. She was around 17 years old at that time, so who knows she might have her own first love story to tell at that time.Kudos to Hikari Matsushima/Rikako Yagi (older/younger Yae Noguchi) and Takeru Satoh/Taisei Kido (older/younger Harumichi Namiki) that brought this series to live. We, as audience, could really feel their emotion in every scene.The only downside in this series was the constant back and forth timeline every 3-5 minutes, sometimes we as the audience, got lost to which timeline the scene was, because not every scene transition was accompanied by the date and place.Caution: episode 7,8 and 9 was a real tear jerker, so please prepare a handkerchief or a box of tissue or if you are an emotional person, you should prepare a bath towel instead.Classic 10/10."
tt15289042,"This was one of the most beautiful shows I've ever watched. It captures you from the get-go and makes you feel so many emotions throughout. It follows Yae and Namiki, both each other's first loves, the paths they take in life and how one small thing, or action, can change the course.The way it was shot, the chemistry between the main characters (both as teens and adults), the transitions between past and present, - it was all perfect. The way their stories intertwined was so impactful, it made me want to believe deeply in fate and in love. The dialogue, the character development, and the acting were all amazing too. It fully captivated me and is definitely one of the best shows of this genre."
tt15289042,"As much as I really wanted to like this romantic and slice-of-life series, I just couldn't. While the premise is interesting, the plot was too meandering and the actors couldn't pull off convincingly different versions of the main characters - younger, current, and older.The Good: I like that the story is set in Sapporo. It's too bad, though, that the distinctiveness of the city was not put to better use. It could have easily been a character on its own. Think ""Fargo"", ""Midnight in Paris"", or ""Lost in Translation"" to name a few.The Bad: I think this is one of those cases where an anime version would have been better than live-action. Putting music to practically every scene does not make up for mediocre scripting and dialogues. Better writers could have improved this series.Despite all the faults, there remain some endearing elements of the story. For one, the idea that all of us need and deserve romantic love. And of course the idea of the first love being sweet and unforgettable. So for sentimental reasons I gave more stars."
tt0287337,"The most strange part of Bill's work from over 12 years ago is that it rings true to this day. Check out his Bush material on ""Arizona Bay"" & see if it doesn't sound like a modern day comedian talking about George W.As for ""Sane Man"" it is easily one of the Top Ten Funniest stand-up videos of all time. Watch it & call me a liar. You can't! It's on par with ""Richard Pryor Live"" (or ""Live on the Sunset Strip"")His attacks are precise. His findings relevant. His timing perfect. He manipulates the microphone like no one else.Tool fans will recognize Bill as the guy from the song ""Third Eye"" telling the ""today a young man on acid..."" story. I loved Bill's work, miss him dearly & quote him AT LEAST once a week, hence my screen name for over seven years: BillHicksFan"
tt0287337,"Comedian Bill Hicks performs a live stand-up show in Austin, Texas.Classic Bill Hicks. Some great, hilarious observations on life, politics and people all delivered in Hicks's inimitable intense, stream-of-consciousness style. The show includes some of Hicks's most legendary jokes, including ""Watcha reading for?"", the positive LSD story, housekeeping, the war on drugs.The first half of this is incredible and the show looked heading for perfection only for Hicks to run out of steam in the second half. There's a lot of stuff that's really just a rant without a punchline, stuff that he seems to have made up on the spot so is very unstructured and doesn't quite land a hit.All in all its very funny though the second half was disappointing."
tt0287337,"Bill Hicks' ""Sane Man"" is a concert performance from the summer of 1989 - although most of the material in this show can also be heard on his ""Dangerous"" album, there's something to be said for watching the man on film. His passion for his subject can only go so far on CD, and his few visual gags don't translate well.The image of Hicks as a visionary, howling unregarded in the wilderness, has been overdone among his hardcore fan base, but watching ""Sane Man"" shows how accurate that description really is. His act attacks runaway consumerism, the pornography industry, non-smokers, the nature of American politics and all points in between. His interaction with his audience is not typical of a stand-up comedian, as he goads and cajoles them into feeling as angry about his topics as he himself does - sometimes it works, but at other times Hicks seems totally isolated on stage.More than ten years after his death, Bill Hicks' voice deserves to be heard by a wider audience. ""Sane Man"" is a fine place to start."
tt0287337,"Ok it's true. I TOO am from Austin, TX. (Are people in Austin the only ones who know this gem exists?) Therefore, I might be slightly biased. I know several comics in the local scene here and most all of the comics wish to be Bill Hicks on SOME level. Bill Hicks is to our generation what Lenny Bruce was to that of the late 1950's and early to mid 1960's. In my opinion, the BEST comedy is the type that not only makes you laugh but challenges you to think and ask questions as well. It is also rife with social commentary.This performance video is NOT for the ""squeamish"" and ""sensitive"". If you appreciate the ""comedic stylings"" of Adam Sandler or Dana Carvey, or if you have ever said to yourself: ""Damn that Carrot Top is funny! Where DOES he come up with these things?!?!?"" then I suggest you move along. For as you spend time reading this TV show ""COPS"" is on the air somewhere and you're MISSING IT!If however you fall into that ""other"" category, this might just be your ticket.Bill Hicks was never one to mince words, and this 1989 taping at the ""Laugh Stop"" in Austin, TX. is certainly no exception. This film was made primarily as a ""demo"" for the folks at HBO in hopes of lading Bill a spot in their ""One Night Stand"" series. Thanks to Bill's friend Kevin Booth, we now have this as a piece of his lasting legacy.In this set, Bill touches on several issues from smoking, to drugs, to religion, to pornography, to musical pop culture. (This part's a HOOT! If this particular bit doesn't make sense to you, insert more current names. It will become clear.) This was Bill at the height of his career. He was exceedingly vibrant and full of life. --- Sadly, as with most truly great artists, he was taken from us at age 32 after a battle with pancreatic cancer.Still, once you watch this you will be begging for more. I promise! (This is assuming you got the joke to begin with. If you didn't do not fear. I think Nick at Night is running ""Who's the Boss"" right now, and if you hurry, you can catch it.)When you then find yourself in need of a ""Hicks fix"", there is much to be gleaned. (You're already ON the internet! Just do a search for ""Bill Hicks"".) There are four albums produced when Bill was still alive and two that were released years after his death. There are also various videos to be had. After a few good doses of Hicks, you will be amazed and astounded at how the insights of a man that young can be so profound and so relevant to today's society and culture. (The rest of you will look at the screen like a dog that's just been shown a card trick.)________________________________________________________________________For those of you who have over the years enjoyed the humor of Denis Leary, I would HIGHLY suggest that you view this video and listen to a few of Bill's Albums. I am sad to report to you that Denis ""hacked"" a good majority of his early act from Bill Hicks. Denis however was a more toned down almost ""user friendly"" version of Hicks.There is a VERY dark joke amongst comics: Q: ""Why did Bill Hicks die but Denis Leary continues to live? A: ""Because there's 'No Cure for Cancer'.""
(And as Bill's friend Jimmy Pineapple would say, ""Case F***ing Closed!"")"
tt0287337,"Sane Man is Bill's best performance ever caught on tape. Never before had I seen a comedian with so much great material, whose delivery was ""on"" for every second. Be warned: Bill Hicks ruins you for lesser comedians.Though this concert was taped in 1989, his subject matter (drugs, sex, hypocrisy, advertising & consumerism), style, ideas, and humor hasn't become dated in the least. Watching his performance eleven years later I am humbled by how relevant, insightful, and unique his views were.Watch this tape with some friends and be astounded by 80 minutes from the voice of reason of a man who had a lot to say, said it, and spiced it up with some great punchlines."
tt0287337,"What can I say that hasn't been said before? Well, here goes! Bill, you sorry sack of sh*t, bet your not laughing now, huh!!? Well, that about raps it up for whats not been said before! And now on to the more important stuff! If any fans of comedy haven't seen Sane Man, I implore you to buy it right now, buckle yourself in and get ready for one of the most outrageous and rib tickling experiences of your life! This is Bill Hicks at his most PC offencive and anarchic best. The bit about Debbie Gibson, Tiffany and Jimmy Hendrix....possibly the funniest skit I have ever heard in my life! He was the comedic Frank Zappa! Erm, apparently I'm suppose to write ten lines of this crap! Well, i cannot be bothered to write anymore, so I will just press one key for a few more lines, OK!

tt1421373,"I am not a fan of Louie. I think the show is rather slow, bloated, lifeless, charmless, and utterly pretentious. It doesn't have a consistent pace of any sort, and doesn't really maintain my interest. I think part of its exposure is that Louie does so much of the work in the show, straight to the editing. I don't think any of it is well-deserved. Hilarious by Louie C.K. however, is stand-up art. His routine, which doesn't translate as well on television, works perfectly here as he engages with the audience, shocks the audience, and leaves them consistently laughing throughout the entire movie. There isn't much of a rhythm and flow to Louie C.K.'s comedy unlike that of Gabriel Iglesias and even Kevin Hart. His topics jump from one end of the spectrum to the next, and that is what makes his comedy appealing—the unpredictability of it all. There will be physical humor in the form of an elongated sequence in which he---well, you'll see; and then there will be excellent real-world observations like America's inability to accept that the evolving technology is nothing short of amazing. He observes the real world, talks about his family, and discusses his private life as well. But within these typical stand-up topics you'll get plenty of angry raunchy humor that is inches away from just being purely anarchic. Louis C.K. is a new-age George Carlin, one that uses exaggeratory words, phrases, and statements to make his point—and will not be afraid of an abundance of strong words to help deliver the message. The beauty of Hilarious is that you can step in at any given point in the movie and never truly feel lost. His stage is very simple, the camera work is very simple, and it's just Louis C.K. running the show and absorbing all the attention. Even his wardrobe is extremely simple: t-shirt and jeans. It adds to his comedy—he looks like a simple middle-aged man that can spark interesting topics while throw in some toilet humor just in case you get bored. Louis C.K.'s best comedy mainly and solely comes from his stand-up as opposed to his extracurricular activities----just like Kevin Hart. And Hilarious is easily one of his best works, and never veers you away from the stage. It is pessimistic, crude, rude, exaggerated, and quietly out-of-control. And it works in every possible level. The ultimate joke is that Louis C.K. is a very intelligent man, but he will never pass off as that with his persona, his choice of words, and uncaring attitude. While his show is nowhere near to be decent, you can't argue against his stage presence in the least bit—he is among the best in the business."
tt1421373,"Louis C.K.'s latest comedy concert film is Hilarious, the first ever stand-up documentary to be accepted at Sundance. The film is economically produced--C.K. does his own direction and editing--and spends much of its time in a mid shot of C.K.'s face; content is everything here.Whatever its personal implications, C.K.'s recent divorce is a great development for his comedy: it allows him to take his trademark pessimism on dates, to the gym, and even to the club. He pares incredulous contempt for beautiful people with his own healthy self-loathing--but because this is Louis C.K, he absolutely never pities himself. In fact, many of his best barbs are aimed at the entitled and ungrateful among us: among other great jabs, this film contains his now-famous ""chair in the sky"" airplane routine.Much of his best and most human material is derived from life as a father; he invokes his daughters with a disarming love and respect, while realistically explicating the more disgusting elements of parenthood. This too benefits from his recent divorce, as it serves to alienate him even further from contemporary dating.There is also a fair number of shock laughs, of course--at one point C.K tellingly acknowledges that upsetting people makes him laugh. And that in itself is the great appeal of Louis C.K.'s comedy, that we can bond over the idea that nothing good will ever happen to anyone and then find humor in it. Hilarious is all about finding laughs in pessimism, and it demonstrates what a hilarious performer C.K. is. -TK 9/22/10"
tt1421373,"Louie ck isn't your everyday comedian. you see that in hilarious. during this performance i thought he seemed off/not himself. maybe he had a lot on his mind. or high/drunk. you get vibes from him that he's winging it and a bunch of times he loses his train of thought or says something like ""i am losing my mind"". its hilarious how he tries to composes himself. he does not give a crap. his comedy is like therapy. he talks about marriage, children, fatness, ... its cool how he relates comedy to deep issues.... i don't know really what else to say besides anybody who is a Louie ck fan should see this. it truly will knock your socks off whatever the hell that means"
tt1421373,"Louis C.K. has been having a cultural moment for quite a while largely because stand-up comedy has hit a doldrums with audiences souring on Dane Cook and Carlos Mencina and not really bonding well with Kevin Hart. ""Louie"" gets called ""The Comedians' Comedian"" more often than contenders such as Marc Maron. While no direct translation exists in regular English, the phrase is roughly the kindest, most polite way to point out that someone is not actually, conventionally, funny. At his best, however, Louie does make you think in the way history's best comedian George Carlin's more heady philosophical moments would make you stop and take note. However, largely Louie spends his time telling scatologically or sexually- themed anecdotes from his life. He has more than made his investment back on his two daughters whose foibles account for much of his material with his physical condition and bedroom habits largely making up the rest. In short, while you won't walk away quoting good lines, you might pick up some interesting insights."
tt1421373,"I actually had high expectations, but from what I've seen of his, this is by far his weakest. Something just didn't lick as much as his others and the material to me wasn't as funny. Saying that though, it's still decent enough. Chewed Up, which came before it, is showing him at his best though and there seems to be a definite change of tone. Still, there are enough decent moments and there's some pretty spot-on commentary as to the world we live in and the type of people we've become as a whole, together with ongoing technology advancements. So if you want to see all of his stand-ups, still recommended, and you can expect some true goodness."
tt2106476,"I saw this movie yesterday. I agree with previous reviewers, this is an excellent, moving, wonderfully acted movie. It is impossible I think to go through it without being brought to tears at one point or another. You also feel like screaming at some characters sometimes - ""what are you doing? Open your eyes! Listen!"" But the great thing is you always understand where each character is coming from- you might not agree with their actions, but nothing they do feels forced or unrealistic. Mikkelsen is amazing in this. I had seen him in a few movies before, and always thought highly of him, but here he is just incredible. It's a tough subject matter, and the movie does not shy away from it, but at the same time it is not vulgar or ""in your face"", it's tactful. I really loved it."
tt2106476,"Here in the small town where I reside, our local newspaper had a recent headline that a beloved teacher was suspected of improper contact with a student. The article was complete along with his picture and I felt that this teacher's life was over as he knew it whether the information was accurate or false. I felt that I would withhold judgement pending an accurate and a detailed investigation, but I know that others would not give the teacher this courtesy. Human nature is an interesting thing to observe and we often get trapped in our own snares with comments such as ""I really can't tolerate judgemental people"".Recently I saw another Danish movie ""The Hijacking"" and was so impressed with it, that I sought out this movie as it was also a highly regarded project. I'm glad I did. The movie reflected the idea of a rush to judgement and all the implications of how society reacts when information is inaccurately reinforced.The title of the movie, ""The Hunt"" is symbolic of Lucas's hunt for justice, but also feeling like the hunted. It begins with friends at a hunting camp drinking & celebrating but this hunt is all a metaphor for Lucas's life. Perhaps it was best expressed when his son got a family heirloom hunting rifle and it was said that now he was old enough to find his way in the forest. ""The Hunt"" is really about such a journey and the forest was thick with assumptions, accusations, hatred, betrayal, and a host of other thorns, briars, branches and such things to trip up the journey. Having felt like he was being hunted through a community's narrow rifle scope of understanding, Lucas's idea of hunting is ultimately altered....and believably so.Vinterberg does a masterful job of story telling and in such a way that we hear a morality tale. Yes, many times the information we are told in the news is correct. But what if it isn't? What price is paid by the victim and his/her family? If you want to watch a movie that is different from the typical Hollywood variety and gives you reason to search more deeply before believing what you see and hear, watch ""The Hunt"" and see if you would find your way through the same forest that Lucas traveled. Few of us would be able to do so...."
tt2106476,"""The Hunt"" is the latest unflinching drama from Danish auteur Thomas Vinterberg. Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, this is an ambitious star vehicle for legendary actor Mads Mikkelsen, an icon in Denmark and familiar face around the world as well. He plays Lucas, a small-town kindergarten teacher. At its heart the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice, based on true incidents, that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved.To delve into the plot here would reveal too much. So I'll just say that the film is quite dark and deals with some very difficult subject matter that can be very hard to watch at times. I'll leave it to you to decide if you want to be more aware of the details by looking up a basic synopsis.This is essentially a one-man show. While supporting cast members are all up to the challenge, Lucas is on on screen virtually every moment of the movie and its overall success rises or falls on his believability. Mikkelsen's delicately underplayed characterization of a man under fire likely won't be appreciated or understood by all viewers. His restrained performance is remarkable and does much to make The Hunt a haunting, memorable experience. Among the children, Annika Wedderkopp's portrayal of Klara is frighteningly brilliant. She steals every scene she's in.The physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath. Natural lighting is used to match the heights and depths of the kindergarten children's emotions. Their innocence is reflected in its intensity. When surrounded by love, they are glowing. The color palette is warm and inviting. As fear rises, they appear in shadow. The tableau turns increasingly darker as the narrative does.This is a very quiet and thoughtful experience in many ways. Nikolaj Egelund's score is sparse. Editors Janus Billeskov Jansen and Anne Østerud keep the pace measured and deliberate. The focus is on the story. Long takes without dialogue are quite effective as so much is said in the eyes, in the faces, of Lucas, the kids, and townsfolk. Cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen allows the lush landscape of the Danish countryside to lull the viewer into a sense of peace, in contrast with the turmoil just under the surface, ready to jump out like a demon in a horror film. But these are real life nightmares, not the product of a genre writer's imagination, which chill to the bone.Hollywood could never touch this subject and have anywhere near the impact. Backed independently by Swedish and Danish production companies, director Vinterberg actually intended to set and shoot the picture in Canada but better tax incentives and financing led him back to his native country of Denmark. It doesn't matter, though. This is the kind of isolated little village that can be found anywhere in the world.""The Hunt"" was easily the saddest film I've seen all year but in a cathartic way that only a great work of art can accomplish. It's a gritty and hard-hitting statement on our judgmental society that pulls no punches in its recounting of a controversial ripped-from-the-headlines story, repeated all too often in recent history, that's both poignant and polarizing in its authenticity.It was difficult for me to hold back tears during the screening. I broke down several times. Many will be touched by certain scenes more than others, but ""The Hunt"" is one of the most affecting and emotional films I've ever seen and one of the best of 2012."
tt2106476,"In Thomas Vinterberg's superb psychological thriller, The Hunt, a town turns on its kindergarten teacher, Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen), from the erroneous testimony of a little girl, Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), who accuses him of molesting her. She's also the daughter of his best friend, Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen), who believes along with the town that Lucas is guilty because children, especially his daughter, don't lie. Although Klara claims throughout she said a stupid thing and Lucas did nothing, his parents are convinced she is just reacting to the gravity and changing her story. Tragic blindness is not just the province of Oedipus.The film's title, with bookending male hunting rituals, is obviously figurative for the hunt by the town's people for Lucas's well being. Only too swift is their condemnation, their righteous indignation, blinded by Salem-witch like certainty that he is guilty. The town's vigilante-like attitude is reminiscent of Frankenstein's townsfolk, hounding the monster without even trying to understand.Beyond the figurative display of crowd wrong-headed mentality is the disturbing suggestion that at any time a life can be turned upside down without even being responsible. It also suggests that the only antidote is to keep believing in yourself.Maybe more powerful is a sense of humor, which occurs occasionally in the film and is best exemplified when a friend, upon Lucas's return from police headquarters, shouts as Lucas embraces his son, ""Hey! If you fondle your kid, you'll go back to jail."" It's gallows humor, but it is effective. Just as effective as the ironic humor is the low-key, natural lighting, consistent close-ups, and ubiquitous hand-held camera work. It is an intimate business that closes in on everyone in the town, not just the innocent victim.Having witnessed through this intense work of art the vulnerability all have in the face of a crowd mentality, we should remember the Chorus's final warning in Oedipus Rex: ""Therefore wait to see life's ending ere thou count one mortal blest; Wait till free from pain and sorrow he has gained his final rest."""
tt2106476,"This film comes right after the hysteria generated by the Jimmy Saville abuse scandals and the revelations about pedophilia within the Catholic Church.Suffice to say it is refreshing and pertinent to see a story about the damage that can be caused to an innocent man, by a false report. We live in a society that is increasingly insecure and paranoid about pedophilia, rape and abuse. Virgin Airlines won't allow a man to sit next to a child who is traveling alone. Men are given funny looks in playgrounds. Mothers are reported to social workers when they give their screaming kids a slap in public.This film demonstrates the danger that comes from that hysteria and reminds us all that children, for whatever reason, do not always tell the truth. The consequences are brutal and made all the more realistic by a stellar cast of actors. I give props to the young actress playing Klara, the girl who makes the false accusation, she was fantastic.Distressing, highly emotional, but unlike an American movie, never over-bearing in its sentimentality, minus one or two slightly cliché metaphors in the dialogue. It makes you empathize with all the characters, not just the protagonist and really makes you think about what you would do if you found yourself, or someone you loved, in that situation."
tt2106476,"I've been an IMDb user for several years. Still, this is my first review. After watching this Film, I just felt the urge to praise it. So here it is: thanks to the writer, director, actors and all those who created this masterpiece. It really has the power to convey real feelings to the watcher. Even though I kept telling to myself it was just a movie, it still made me care for the characters.It's a shame that such Films are not promoted as they should be. I am so sorry I had no idea about Danish cinematography until now. This movie will make stay alert for any new Danish production and look for older ones in a desperate try to recover what you could've experienced instead of all the commercial movie offer of Hollywood."
tt2106476,"While thought provoking and asks some interesting questions about social dynamics and humanity in general, the problem is that I found it not that engaging to watch sometimes. On top of that, developing a fully fleshed out plot is on the back burner in order for these specific scenes that raise said questions, which makes the plot feel contrived and unaddressed.It would have been more effective if it had an interesting and engaging plot that also raised the questions, rather serving only one goal. Who killed the dog? Why did the plot not address his side of the story? Is it possible someone else molested them in a basement with the particular details? Where did that story come from? All of it doesn't matter because the movie is trying to make entirely different points.So, it's fine. For what it is. It also could have been edited better to make it more engaging and less boring at times, I felt."
tt2106476,"A story about how to destroy a good person on the count of three; and the child is not even to blame. adults themselves have grown a huge fruit of evil, like wizards - from nothing"
tt2106476,"I just saw The Hunt at the New Zealand International Film Festival and I walked out speechless. The Hunt has such a difficult story to tell but the film makers never go too far with little exposition. The film doesn't take one side over another, making the point that there isn't really any ""bad guys"" in the film, just people on opposite sides of one coin. The script is shocking, tragic and at times funny. The film is very intimately shot with an almost documentary approach. The film is mostly shot hand-held, giving you the feeling of realism. The camera likes to get in close and hold on the actors eyes and it is the eyes that tell the story. Most of the story is told through what was not being said, but instead with looks and pauses. Mads Mikkelsen is stunning as always as the man accused of sexual abuse. He plays the role with such sensitivity to the character but always keeps you guessing throughout the film. Annika Wedderkopp plays the role of the innocent young girl to perfection, again always keeping you guessing. Their relationship being one of the most interesting I've seen on film this year. If I had one complaint it would be that the main plot ends quite abruptly, not leaving me fully satisfied before it goes into the epilogue. The Hunt is drama at its best with beautiful performances from the entire cast. It is hard to explain how great this film is without giving away spoilers but the film gives no clear answers for such a difficult subject and it makes you ask yourself, what would I do?"
tt2106476,"'The Hunt' is a truly accomplished film, its simple premise and themes are executed perfectly. The film is hugely engrossing and completely and utterly infuriating, which is a testament to the merits of its acting, direction, script and hyper-realism.The film follows Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen), a lonely primary school teacher who relishes his job and is popular with both the children and the local community. Just as he meets Nadja (Alexandra Rapaport) and begins a relationship with her, his relationship with another woman, 5-year-old Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), lands him in immeasurable trouble. What happens is a completely innocuous misunderstanding, but the community, the 'adults' who are supposed to be rational and fair, turn into a lynch mob.The film is about the danger of mass hysteria, ignorance and subsequently the frightening power of numbers. It teaches the importance of measure and consideration; it's a much-needed anecdote to the sensational vilification, general ignorance, and trashy media that permeates our lives.The film is intelligently and thoughtfully written. The girl is by no means vindictive; as much as you want to vent your anger, she's clearly far too young to understand what is happening. It's the 'adults' who display their stupidity, their total lack of reasoning and fairness left me indignant for the entirety of the running time and subsequently the whole evening - the film really works.There is a palpable sense of danger throughout the film, and you genuinely fear for Lucas' life; seldom have I empathised with a character so dearly. Who would've thought a Danish Art House film could be so thoroughly gripping?'The Hunt' is a thought-provoking, tactful and important film that should be seen by as many people as possible. It's one of the best films of 2012."
tt2106476,"Disturbing tale, very uncomfortable film, to watch what happens to this man. Simple and one-sided, but still a good portrayal of a tragedy that feels very real."
tt3210258,"I enjoy stand up. very much. but whenever i watch a stand up performance or a comedy special, i look for something not as usual of what in use to seeing. bo burnham exceeds this greatly. out of this world creative and different from just watching someone do stand up. it's more then stand up honestly. this special and his other are very good. another comedy special with this type of boy the usual stand up performance is the middleton and shwartz improv on netflix."
tt3210258,"Much like Make Happy, I had a lot of fun with this, but I can't help thinking that this may have landed on the side of those things that Bo isn't all that proud of anymore.There is definitely a lot of clever stuff in this, but equally there's a lot of stuff that feels like it relies on edge over wit and good writing, and if I thought Make Happy slightly lacked a focus, holy hell is this all over the place.Bo himself performs it as flawlessly as ever, but it still goes from dark fairytale, to left brain/right brain craziness, to poetry, to frog pedophiles, and it felt more like a series of his ""lol random"" YouTube videos than something with any kind of connecting theme.There are some really great songs and jokes here though, and I wouldn't say I was disappointed as much as I was intrigued by him having gone from this to Inside, and seeing the evolution - even if I did see it going backwards.Something I did note as being more impressive in this than in Make Happy is the sheer amount of times he must have rehearsed this to make sure he had it absolutely perfect, because I think this must have relied much more on the background sound effects and Bo's ability to know exactly which ones were coming and how to react to them with such precise timing...especially the ending bit. That must have been a nightmare to get right.But it's a worthy entry in his stand up for sure, and equally worthy in his discography, even if it does seem like a bit of a relic from the age of random = funny that we've thankfully seemed to have moved past."
tt3210258,"Bo returns to the stage, and delivers on his multiple talents - playing instruments(mostly ""air"" ones) and comedy - musical(including making it largely out of sampled sounds), verbal and physical. He goes for wordplay, the clever, and the silly, with universal jokes, rather than ones that will date this.As usual, he prioritizes being consistently funny and challenging over having one specific focus - with that said, he does get rather introspective(such as the ""two halves of the brain"" bit), and one can tell that he has grown since he launched on the internet. Of course, this doesn't mean that he is unrecognizable, far from it. His brand and identity remain intact, and in-between, sometimes even in, the intellectual parts, he gets just as immature as we want him to.Awkwardness is embraced, not shied away from. That of himself, and some of the things that go into shaping a show like this - yes, he does go as meta and self-referential as usual(a child of YouTube, that much is clear). We can follow his line of thinking, and yet he throws curve-balls our way. Plain and simple, we never, for a second, know exactly what he's going to do next, and whenever he jumps tracks in his train of thought, the audience(including the live ones for the video recording of this) loves it. It is simply that carefully crafted.Among his material are social problems(with an indictment of himself and other artists, making this simultaneously the illness and the cure, the reason for needing, and the actual pursuing of, therapy), integrity, religion, sexuality, etc. At the time of writing this, the entire well-paced 60-minute presentation is up on, and thus endorsed by, his own channel, so legally free to watch.There is brutal and disturbing imagery in this. I recommend this to any fan of Burnham. 8/10"
tt3210258,"I have admired Bo Burnham since he was 16 and I was 22. At the time (and still), I was teaching 16-years-olds how to write music; but for me, Bo was a source for my own study. His wit, his timing, and his absolutely genius writing was simply something I had never seen before in lyrical form.Bo started out as a giant: and still he continued to grow. This show is, simply put, masterful. It is laugh-out-loud funny, it is surprising, it is honest, and simultaneously real and surreal. Bo: my hat is off to you. Please keep doing exactly what you're doing: and please keep surprising us with something different."
tt3210258,"Bo Burnham found accidental fame after posting a couple comedy songs on YouTube. His first special ""words, words, words"" was a collection of pun heavy comedic songs which would have you laughing instantly and than hours later after the puns finally caught up with you. This special 'what' follows in his trade make style of quick and quirky comedic songs while this time being accompanied by an arrangement of lights and backing tracks. Burnham talks about religion, modern 'pop stars' and ask's questions we never knew we needed answers too.This musical style of comedy is very quickly becoming my favourite genre. 10/10 glittery dick jokes."
tt3210258,"This wasn't just a comedy show. In fact, I think the comedy was secondary to what was an introspective, artistic masterpiece of debatably unmatched proportions. Every second of this special was incredible, even when the jokes weren't - which wasn't often. I get that comedy is subjective, but this was more than comedy. Bloody brilliant!"
tt3210258,"When I first saw 'what', I was expecting levels of brilliance which were on par with his previous special 'words words words'. Did it surpass my expectations? Indeed it did. There are many highlights to this daring, creative and catchy comedy special. When you watch this special, it truly gets ingrained in your mind. This has happened to me so much that I can do the entire opening segment by heart(not as good as Bo). Notable songs include, repeat stuff, from god's perspective, we think we know you, sad and left brain, right brain. This comedy special will keep you laughing and have you talking about it for a long time. Overall, 9.2/10."
tt3210258,"I love Bo's comedy, this show is great. The ups and the lows contrast so well, and the end song when you know that he quits later and the reason just hits so much harder. It's hard to rank comedy shows on my ranking. But I think of it as a solid 8.5/10. It's fun, crude, and subverts expectations."
tt3210258,"I had not heard of this comedian before and found this special on Netflix and thought I would give it a try. To sum up my thoughts... I do appreciate Bo Burnham's wit and cleverness. I also appreciate his silly and zany performance as well as his musical talents. I just don't find it laugh out loud funny. Unfortunately, I found What. to be annoying and Bo's singing voice sounds like nails on a chalkboard to me. It's looking doubtful that I will continue watching past 35 minutes. That said, I give him credit for being young, clever and making it happen for himself. And hey, I suggest at least checking out his set because who knows, maybe his comedy is right up your alley."
tt3210258,"After seeing Bo Burnham's ""Words Words Words"" I became a bit hooked on his style and musical taste. And then seeing another person call this new special a ""masterpiece"", I had to see if he could pull it off again. My initial opinion is no.With a voice that sounds more like Weird Al every day, the show featured a large amount of pre-recorded material. While the bits surrounding that material was funny at times, it stretched on a bit long and really took away from the natural spontaneity of stand up comedy.Burnham has also become more obscene. While his misogyny is clearly ironic, he pushes the sexual humor to a new level. Funny? Yes. But also a sad thing, because he is smarter than this and going for a laugh with a sex joke is the easy way out.The ""God song"" (title unknown) was a high point, and he still has plenty of musical creativity in him. I would gladly see Burnham live and look forward to the next special. This was not perfect, but it shows he has not run the well dry just yet."
tt3210258,"I really liked Words, Words, Words, but this one left me dry. The songs on the whole were well composed and well played, but for me the finale was a rip-off of early 80s Rowan Atkinson, just with higher tech. For the joke parts, my ""crap joke detector"" was beeping after only half of the setup, and as I have a similar taste in humour it was obvious what his punchline would be most of the time. Some of it was literally random, and not even pretending to be otherwise. Some was edgy just to be edgy, rather than being funny, which made an old greybeard like me look forward to him just growing up a bit. The production was razor sharp, but alas that made it almost look like he was just showing off, rather than entertaining. I've seen clips of stuff he's done later, and this definitely hasn't put me off watching more of his oeuvre.I'd be curious to know if, 11 years on, Bo is proud of this one, or now cringes at it? If he doesn't cringe, that's OK, I cringed enough for two."
tt3210258,"DISCLAIMER: FOR ITS TIMEThis special was peak Bo Burnham (EARLY) comedy. This was his comedy before he was subjected to cancel culture. I'm not saying by any means the jokes that used offensive language were right (or should be told this day and age), I'm just saying, when I watched this in high school when it was put on Netflix, it set the bar for comedy specials for me, and no special has ever reached it."
tt3210258,"Look. I think the best comedy shows leave a person's eyes wet. I'm elated after seeing this a third time, and I'm let down by the fact that I expected over a hundred reviews on this, and I only see twelve. In my ignored opinion, this special is just... underrated.I have my own performance tomorrow and I'm watching this to help me mentally prepare. It's not going to be nearly as big of a crowd, and it's not going to on Netflix like ""what."" but it's my 6th performance and Bo Burnham is the ONLY guy in this world (so far) that I identify with as far as the anxiety, creativity, dark thoughts, desires to please people, and a craving to stand out and be unique for the sake of being unique not ""Edgy"" like another review on here says.""Part of me loves you, part of me hates you. Part of me fears you."" I'm BLOWN AWAY by how similar I feel to Bo on a personal level. I don't know if it's just something that creative people understand, but I wish everyone could understand. Cause otherwise I may as well be talking to the dang wall. It honestly makes me angry. I don't want to be angry. I want to understand why people don't like what Bo is trying to do. I want to know where people's distaste for... ANYTHING stems from, rather than be offended by their differing opinions.I feel like ""Inside"" is the most relatable special he's ever done, and gets significantly more praise than his other specials, like this one. Rightfully and deservedly so, but still... I feel like I identify with this special the most because it's his FIRST Netflix special, and it's unlike any other comedy show I've ever seen. What an entrance he made with this one. His debut show, and yet, I feel like the crazy person in the room for liking it as much as I do. That's messed up.It FEELS like an experience for me every time I watch it, and it just... bums me out that I can't share that feeling with anyone else. I hate feeling alone in enjoying something I consider to be beautifully crafted and brilliantly executed. He even uses his ""awkward quirkiness"" as comedy. I can't wrap my head around that! Maybe I'm naïve or even stupid, but man, I just love watching what I consider to be a REAL, be it, damaged, artist at work.Whatever. I don't know if anyone is getting anything out of the message I'm trying to convey. I doubt this review is going to be helpful to anyone. So, bye.If anyone is still reading this, thank you for your time."
tt3521134,"With just two films to his name, both about the Indonesian mass-murders of the mid-1960's Oppenheimer has become the most important documentarian of his generation. His second film, ""The Look of Silence"", coupled with his ""The Act of Killing"" has created a sea- change in the Indonesian truth, justice and reconciliation movement. Forcing new laws to be written and putting the government in a defensive position against the nation's media.But Oppenheimer is more than an activist. He's an artist. His films are contemplative, playful and quietly confrontational. His visual attack is succinct, his marriage of form and theme is flawless and his moral intent is thunderous.Where ""Act of Killing"" was concerned with a larger study of post-massacre Indonesia, ""Look of Silence"" chooses a more intimate landscape. Geographically, emotionally and cinematically it is regional. Concerned with a single killing, the men who did it – directly and indirectly - the family it affected and the small village that has lived with questions about other killings like it for fifty years. Where ""Act of Killing"" lived in absurdist grand cinema, ""Look of Silence"" exists in tight close-ups of the perpetrators, survivors and truth-seekers. More than anything, more than words, their faces tell the story. So much happens behind the eyes, around the corners of the mouth, in unspoken glances. The horror, doubt, guilt and seemingly impossible reconciliation stirs below the surface. For all the cinematic flex of ""Act of Killing"", this contained take on the same material, seems more haunted and human.The star of the film, Adi the eyewear peddler, pursues this mission with intelligence and courage. We meet his family. His happy playful daughter, his thoughtful son, his cautious loving wife, his ageless mother (probably the most engaging character captured on film this year), his wisp of an ancient father, and his memory of a murdered brother, looming over everything. From them he finds the courage to question murderer after murderer face-to-face. The combination of his profession as an optometrist with his quest to seek truth would seem heavy-handed if it were fiction, but nothing here is inauthentic. In showing all of Adi's family, from the fresh and young, to the spent and dying, we see the full arc of life.Lastly, the film makes a glancing but firm indictment against the American anti-Communist fervor that fed into - and the American corporations that profited from - these killings. It gives strong evidence that the Cold War, the war of ideology and the murder of millions, allowed for, and was even fought for, Western corporate dominance in places like this. And here the grinding up of human beings for profit in this situation is undeniable. Oppenheimer wants to make sure no one involved gets off without having to face, if not their own role in the massacre of millions, then at the very least, their culture's.And so it goes, the people (wives, mothers, daughters, sons, fathers, husbands), the silence, the haunted jungle hum that fills most of the auditory space in the film, the great and overwhelming significance of it all everything pools together to show us something words alone can't manage. Something about how a horror can be so great that its impact can loom over generations. About living with debilitating fear of those who have claimed power over you through violence. About the most nightmarish tendencies in humanity, and our courageous capacity to overcome the worst of ourselves. About just how difficult it is to look into the eyes of a killer and say, ""I know what you did."" And more profoundly, more frighteningly ""I know you."""
tt3521134,"It's hard to ""review"" a movie like ""The Look of Silence"". You don't really watch it and evaluate it like you do anything else. You bear witness.I have never been able to write anything about its prequel, ""The Act of Killing"". I broke my rule of reviewing every movie I watch on here because I just wasn't up to the task. Watching that movie, and ""The Look of Silence"" to a slightly lesser extent, was like being dosed with heroin and hit with a sledgehammer. The usual ""disturbing"" movie, documentary or otherwise, has an impact that can be shaken off eventually. With ""The Act of Killing"", I never really felt it, but I knew it was there. It took something from me. The impact bled through into my day to day life. It wasn't just like a bad dream. It was real.Here is ""The Look of Silence"". It gives a different side of the story that ""Act of Killing"" presented, through the son of survivors of the Indonesian genocide. He learns about the fate of his older brother, killed two years before his birth. Then he confronts some of the killers and their families, though these meetings don't go as you might expect, especially for the son, Adi.This movie really should be watched alongside ""The Act of Killing"". Whereas ""The Look of Silence"" is no less horrible in its descriptions of actual murder, I have a feeling that it is the goodness of Adi and his family you will remember."
tt3521134,"The Look of Silence is such a brilliant title for this movie. For one, it's a good description of Adi's reaction when hearing about the murder of his brother. (And it's oddly fitting that he is an optometrist). It's also a description of the response they get from the perpetrators, refusing to show any guilt or remorse, preferring to pretend that it never happened. And that seems to be what Oppenheimer is tapping into in Indonesia, the look of silence, and what really lies behind it.This is definitely a companion piece to the previous ""Act of Killing"". Not because it does not stand on its own, which it does, but because they stand so much stronger together. Each documentary has an unique perspective on some mutual themes. Especially guilt and remorse.It's amazing how it all comes together in a movie like this. Oppenheimer must have done a lot of work for this. Adi is such a good subject for a documentary like this, and having him being willing to explore this dark side of his nation's history, and openly talk to the people who brutally murdered his brother - it's such an unique way to explore all of this. And Adi does a really good job with it all."
tt3521134,"""The Act of Killing"" is one of the best, weirdest, and most disturbing movies I've ever seen. Joshua Oppenheimer's follow up documentary, ""The Look of Silence,"" is more conventional in its approach, but it's also deeply affecting.Oppenheimer returns to the same material he mined in ""The Act of Killing,"" the slaughter of communists in Indonesia in the 1960s. The men who actually supervised the killings are alive and well for the most part, and still exercise a gangsterish kind of control over the country. Communists aren't still being murdered overtly and en masse, but one senses that it would be easy for someone to ""disappear"" if he/she pushed too hard against authority. ""The Act of Killing"" stuck close to the murderers, and we watched in stunned disbelief as they gleefully reenacted their killings, the heroes of their own demented movies. ""The Look of Silence"" follows a man whose brother was murdered as part of the Communist purges before he was even born, and now wants to confront the men who carried out the murder. It's unclear, probably even to himself, what he wants from these confrontations. Possibly just an apology, possibly simple recognition of what they did. The conversations run the gamut from cathartic to downright frightening (one man obliquely hints that he could make very bad things happen to the film's protagonist if he wanted to). But the reaction from all of the killers is essentially the same: the past is the past (even though in Indonesia it isn't), why are you bringing all of this up again, can't we just agree to forget?Of course agreeing to forget is what makes horrific events like these possible to repeat. The most fascinating interviews are those not with the killers themselves but with the children of the killers, the people who have inherited their parents' legacies (on both sides of the conflict) and now must make something of the world they share. In some cases, the children learn details they never before knew and we watch them process them on screen in real time. It's difficult as a viewer to know how to feel about these inheritors of their parents' actions. On the one hand, they really can't and shouldn't be held accountable for things their parents did when they were children or possibly not yet even born. On the other hand, like it or not, we all inherit our own histories and have to at least acknowledge them, both the good and the bad, if we are to learn from them.Both ""The Look of Silence"" and ""The Act of Killing"" are infuriating to Western viewers who have been raised to believe that freedom and justice eventually triumph and that evil, either individual or systemic, gets punished. These are brilliant films, and while they certainly sow doubts in my head about the state of mankind, I feel like a better person for having seen them.Grade: A+"
tt3521134,"Act of Killing I bought with some trepidation and settled down on my own to watch it (and watched again immediately after with the Josh/Werner Herzog background discussion - rather the film background to the discussion). Next day I bought Look of Silence. Watched it next night both without and with the background discussion. I was mesmerised (and still am), and so many questions come to mind.The two films work well together, Act of Killing being more overview and focusing on the killers and the political structure/mob rule that is still in power. Act of Killing doesn't particularly explore how they got away with genocide (why the world turned a blind eye), but this is alluded to carefully and specifically in Look of Silence.I could write so much because the two films together have provoked in me a profound perspective on human horror, which has gripped me most recently with what we see on the news with ISIS (Paris Masacre).What are human beings capable of, and why is an individual able to make such choices? What are the structures that facilitate the most grotesque of human acts of wickedness upon one another. Do we all contain wickedness, does a killer lurk inside us all? Does fear itself propel the killers - kill or be killed? Are we (cells in the human organism) enacting our worst imaginable terror, excising evil, I kill therefore I am?Josh Oppenheimer, I applaud your work. The sensitivity and attention to the finest detail employed in your work is, for me, beyond words. The cinematography, colours you choose, balance in composition. Even the subtitles were easy to read. Beautiful lingering pauses. You said of one still scene, a bridge, pale green, a river bank; you have no words to describe how this scene makes you feel, what the scene says. For me this scene (in LoS) is terrifyingly beautiful, sad, the weight of recent history hanging there in the stillness. Embodying the sadness and fear. I love that still scene.Superb, I do not have the words to describe what your films say to me... I will think about them for a long long time, and watch them again."
tt3521134,"The 2012 Oscar-nominated documentary, ""The Act of Killing"", garnered world-wide praise and many awards for its shocking look into the current lives of the perpetrators of genocide in Indonesia during the mid-sixties. Its filmmaker was Texas-born verified genius Joshua Oppenheimer who lives in Denmark and has been making films since 1998. ""The Look of Silence"" is its companion piece, and where the earlier documentary was outwardly horrifying, this one is more quietly disturbing and, I believe, the more important.After my viewing of it finished at 7 a.m., I was lowering myself into a warm bathtub when suddenly I became haunted by the feeling that headless bodies were floating past me as if I were in the Snake River where the corpses had been dumped. Indeed, I couldn't put the film out of my head the rest of the day, and haven't since. The film follows an Indonesian man named Adi Runkun whose brother had been brutally murdered in the 1965 purge of 'communists' as he confronts, in the present day and under the pretext of dispensing eye exams, the men who had carried out the killings (and who had boasted and joked about the carnage in ""The Act of Killing""). We also see Adi's humane care-taking of his nearly dead father whom he bathes and consoles, and other family members who have had to live among his brother's murderers for decades. What makes this film so effective is how Adi refuses to display any emotion at the killers while the director continues to portray them as human beings rather than monsters (no revenge film this), but Adi's silent stare keeps burning into their souls as they squirm uncomfortably, stubbornly offering lame excuses while refusing any expressions of regret. By this method Oppenheimer makes the film much more of an iconic document of man's inhumanity to man, forcing viewers to contemplate parallels in history, most especially the Nazis who perpetrated the Holocaust in Hitler's Germany.There is nothing easy about this film, yet it is one of the few films you must not miss if you have a heart that pumps blood."
tt3521134,"I didn't really know much about the mass killings in Indonesia in the 1960's before watching this documentary, but something about it was so compelling and unbelievable that it practically was a mini-ww2. The Indonesian government at the time were very much like Nazi's, which is sickening, and this documentary brings light about the disgraceful ways religious propaganda can persuade people to kill.What I got out of this documentary was that many of the killers didn't know what a communist was, let alone think they were people. They were spun lies about the communists and many took joy in killing them. One of the most eye opening documentaries I've seen, amongst one of the most sadistic and terrible mass killings in history."
tt3521134,"A companion piece to his haunting and unique 2013 Oscar nominated documentary The Act of Killing, Joshua Oppenheimer's The Look of Silence may not have the same gut wrenching impact of his first Indonesian set tale but it's still a highly insightful and quietly powerful look at the after effects of Indonesia's mass killings in the 1965 Communist round ups.Where The Act of Killing focused its attentions largely on Anwar Congo and his fellow death squad members who were responsible for countless murders of their fellow countrymen, The Look of Silence turns its attentive gaze towards average every day optometrist Adi Rukun and his quest to find those that played a part in the brutal murder of his convicted communist brother Ramli.It's a much more straight forward tale than Killing that became something of a fever dream thanks to its subject's willingness to re-enact and portray their experiences through bizarre home made movies and scenarios that had to have been seen to be believed. Oppenheimer this time around sits his camera on subjects and doesn't shy away from the silence of the film's title where questions are raised and eyes and facial expressions say more than words ever could.Rukun himself is also a likable presence and the way in which he deals and interacts with those that were involved with his brothers demise are the film's most powerful. He asks thoughtful and loaded questions and refrains from letting anger get the better of him and Oppenheimer never shy's away from allowing the story to play out without fanfare or manipulation and the true atrocities of what occurred in the beautiful countryside of Indonesia is never too far away from view even if this is very far from being a history lesson in the events.A finely made compatriot of the Act of Killing that would make for a great double bill with its more accomplished forefather, The Look of Silence is not entertainment but it's an important and effective study on war, loss and family and another reason to suggest that Oppenheimer is one of the world's most interesting documentary filmmakers.3 ½ self-illustrated books out of 5"
tt3521134,"""We'd drag them. Some of them screamed. 'Please, sir! Have mercy!' But we don't care. In fact, we beat him again to shut him up."". Two former death camp leaders proudly re-create the grisly scenes of the '65 purge of supposed ""communists"" under the instigation of the armed forces, which became widely known as the Indonesian Genocide. Documentarian Oppenheimer asks them an explicit question. ""from here, can the prisoners see the blood?"". ""Yes, because the place was lit by torches."", they enthusiastically reply. ""Because others went first. So he's given up hope. 'I'm about to die', he's thinking. 'I'd better accept it'"", they describe the apparent thoughts of their victims before decapitating, mutilating and kicking their bodies into Snake River. ""Feel free to take a photo!"", passing a digital camera to Oppenheimer. They joyously pose atop the butchered souls of thousands, their blood stains infused with the earth they stand on. One of the killers hoists two fingers in the air, offering a peace sign, before proceeding with a thumbs up gesture.Oppenheimer utilised this blood-curdling footage years later, by showing its profound horror to a middle-aged Indonesian man whose brother was an unfortunate victim of the national purge. Acknowledging the explicit nature of his country's past and yearning to learn more, he singlehandedly confronts the perpetrators who executed the killings with Oppenheimer documenting the anxiety-inducing conversations, under the pretence of an eye examination. Through the changing of lenses, this metaphorical dissimulation magnifies the retinas of ""Adi's"" brother's executors, allowing windows into their darkened souls to widen.Predictably, much like with Oppenheimer's creatively profound companion piece 'The Act of Killing', these individuals expressed minimal remorse. Proud to serve their nation and glorify their political ideologies. However, the purpose of these bleak confrontations was not to agitate those that committed such atrocities, but to perpetuate a historic generational divide within Indonesia. The current generation educated with false truths to adhere to the current sociopolitical climate. ""Communists gouged the eyes out of army generals"", students are taught. Yet the truth couldn't be any further from that manipulative fabrication. Everyone seemingly forced into silence regarding the questioning of their own national history. Therefore, producing such an unflinching documentary that dares to question the morality and legitimacy behind one of the worst genocides in recent history, is of paramount importance. Not just to Indonesia, but every nation that endures tainted democracy. Inciting societies to educate themselves and not ignore the grave actions of their previous generation.Oppenheimer challenges the boundaries of documentary filmmaking once again, crafting uncompromising perceptive enlightenment through one man. A man whom represented the nullified silence of those feared by their own government. A man whom fearlessly questioned the very individuals that shaped his current standard of living. Representing the suffering and fragility of an oppressed society. Understatedly profound, yet consistently unshakeable in nature. The inclusion of iridescent quietude, from expansive shots of village life to close-ups of metamorphosis, overemphasising the extinguished freedom of speech. Many of the confrontations delivering unwavering tyrannical sensibilities likening their ideologies to totalitarian repression, exhibiting minimal sorrow for the thousands they slaughtered. Conversations that rightly bury the words under the skin to those listening. Ranging from indirect threats such as ""be careful, what you're doing may be deemed as communist behaviour"" to Western influences including ""America taught us how to hate communists"". Undoubtedly disconcerting.Reservations for the confrontation with ""Adi's"" uncle, whom was guarding ""communists"" before they were massacred, is the sole criticism this documentary obtains. Staged, exploitative and unnecessarily producing familial drama in a nation that is already fragmented and traumatised. Consequently Oppenheimer overstepped the line in that particular instance, despite ""Adi's"" insistence, creating an artificially uncomfortable atmosphere for the sake of drama.However, whilst not creatively innovative as his former insight into the Indonesian Genocide, Oppenheimer's The Look of Silence unequivocally nullifies all emotive output, perhaps more so that his previous directorial efforts. It is unflinching. It is uncompromising. It is of paramount significance. We need boundary-testing documentaries like this to truly provide insight and to evoke human right activism. To microscopically magnify the actions of humanity's past and ensure they never happen again. ""That's politics. Politics is the process of achieving your ideals"", the former commander of civilian militia joyously states with a grimace. ""In many ways...""."
tt3521134,"I don't feel as though this film does anything different than its predecessor. The issue at hand is no doubt important but I don't think I got anything out of this film that I didn't get from The Act of Killing. I understand that it is supposed to be a more personal view of the atrocities but it seems like there isn't much new information.This is a review of the film on its own, not a review of the importance of the work that Oppenheimer is doing. I believe a film's importance and it's quality can be distinguished."
tt3521134,"A fantastic companion piece to The Act of Killing, one of the most deeply disturbing films I've ever seen. But it's not fair to call it a continuation of that film, and what this is revolved around is inherently interesting and riveting in itself. ""I knew nothing about it""... the whole film can be summarized in those few words. the film is infuriating in some of the same ways The Act of Killing was, but less so by the mere fact that it's less concentrated on the individuals who committed those acts. And because it concentrates on the family of a victim, it's heartfelt in a way it's sibling film wasn't. Fantastic, thought-provoking, discomforting in the ideas and questions that it touches upon."
tt3521134,"'THE LOOK OF SILENCE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A companion piece to director Joshua Oppenheimer's 2013 critically acclaimed documentary flick 'THE ACT OF KILLING'. The film centers around one man, who's brother was killed; during the Indonesian killings of 1965 to 1966. Oppenheimer once again directed the movie; which was nominated for an Academy Award, for Best Documentary Feature. I found it to be almost as good, as Oppenheimer's previous feature (which I ranked as one of the best of 2013). Oppenheimer follows an Indonesian man around, that survived the 1965 genocide; by the name of Adi Rukun. Adi's brother, Ramli, was brutally killed; during the 'communist' purge (as a young boy). Adi now wants to confront Ramli's suspected killers (with Oppenheimer's help). He bravely interviews these men, under the pretense of an eye examiner, and seeks uncomfortable answers; as the viewer awkwardly watches. The movie is extremely disturbing, and hard to watch; like it's predecessor. It's also very moving, at times, but never truly satisfying; as Adi can never truly get the honest answers he's looking for (and the suspected culprits show no remorse, of any kind). It's yet another masterpiece, from Oppenheimer; but some will feel like it's just an extension of the other film. That didn't bother me though.watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/A1MyBFioKXM"
tt3521134,"The Look of Silence. The follow up to Joshua Oppenheimer's incredible The Act of Killing, which focused on the unrepentant perpetrators of the under-reported (thanks to western support) 1965 Indonesian 'Communist' genocide. TLOS not as shocking as its predecessor (one watch was enough) but still eye opening and disturbing. TLOS focuses on the brother of one of the murdered who meets the perpetrators to seek solace and for them to express regret. A must see double bill - but the antithesis of popcorn fodder so not for a cosy date! 8 out of ten (The Act of Killing got 9)"
tt3521134,"""Every killer I meet, none of them feels responsible. They don't even feel regret.""Joshua Oppenheimer's follow-up to The Act of Killing is devastating, but important. He bears witness to crimes against humanity that were never punished - in fact, those who committed them were deemed heroes, and are still in power. He follows an Indonesian man visiting people and families with connections to the 1965 Indonesian coup, one that resulted in 500,000 to 1,200,000 people, labeled ""communists,"" brutally executed - including the man's older brother. Like the previous film, we see elderly members of death squads talking openly about the murders and barbarity committed, which is incredibly aggravating to watch. We see a teacher indoctrinating his students, telling them that the communists were ""cruel"" and gouged the eyes out of the generals in the coup, when it was actually the military who did this. Most importantly, however, we see this younger brother (anonymous for his own protection) confront numerous people who were directly involved in the massacres and his brother's death. His forthright, simple question elicit a variety of response, some squirming, some defiant, and some downright threatening. There are claims from some that they didn't know what was happening, or that they were just following orders (that from his own uncle!), the statements of which are right out of the German playbook post-WWII.All of these people seem to want the past to remain in the past, out of what seemed to be various forms of fear - the fear of being held accountable on the part of the killers, and the fear for their safety in the families of the victims. It's symbolic that the man who visits these people gives some of them an eye exam as a pretense to talking to them (hence the movie poster); it's as if he's trying to get them to ""see"" what truly happened nearly 50 years later, and to understand it for what it was - butchery, not heroism. His disturbed look as he hears the killers describing and justifying their atrocities echoes the viewer's thoughts, something which made this a more satisfying watch compared to The Act of Killing.Obviously, though, this is not for the faint of heart. We see a death squad leader, now 72, who drank the blood of his victims believing it would stop him from going insane, describe lopping off a woman's breast and hacking her up because she was a ""bad person."" We see others who dragged hundreds of people down to Snake River, gleefully recount beheading them, and how their headless bodies bobbed up and down in the river afterwards. We hear a man describe how he worked day and night for three months to ""exterminate"" communists, burying them alive. We see an adult daughter say she had grown up proud of her father for exterminating communists, and how he was famous and respected, that is, until she hears him tell her that he brought the head of a woman to a Chinese shop to intimidate the Chinese, and that he drank the blood of his victims. While absolutely brutal, it's incredibly important for Oppenheimer to have documented it.One thing that isn't touched on, probably because it was beyond the scope of the film, was just how complicit and supportive the United States and Great Britain were in all of this. One thug mentions that the Americans ""taught them to hate communists,"" but it went much further than that. (This was the guy who had the audacity to think he deserved a trip to America as a reward for his good deeds, hoo boy if this doesn't elevate your blood pressure or make you want to weep for humanity, I'm not sure what will). We do see footage of a man explaining life in Bali to an American news reporter in the 60's, saying with a straight face that the communists had asked to be killed, and the news report going to explain how communists were being starved in camps and occasionally taken out to be killed. We also see how the union for the plantation workers at the Goodyear Sumatran Rubber Company was branded as ""communist run,"" had its leaders and many members killed, and the survivors forced to continue working at gunpoint, which is practically a capitalist's dream. Think about that the next time you buy a tire.The mass murderers stole the property of their victims and took their wives, so it's another case of political ideology hypocritically being used for personal gain, from these death squad goons all the way up to the top of the power structure in Indonesia. You think of the worst massacres in the 20th century, and you see them coming from the left (Stalin and Mao) and the right (Hitler and Suharto), and there are plenty of other examples on down that list. The dreaded ""other,"" whose invented evils are cast into ""reality"" via propaganda, become the easiest means to power. One guy who was still serving in the Indonesian legislature (and had been for decades following the coup) essentially says that the ends justified the means, shrugging off a million deaths as ""politics,"" and that it was the ""process of achieving one's ideals."" Ideals, ha. The image of the anonymous man's face quietly staring as something outrageous or horrific is being said comes to mind, and it probably will for a very long time."
tt3521134,"In this ""sequel"" of sorts to the Act of Killing that focuses on the struggle of a man to know the responsabilities behind his brother's death, with stronger ties with Annah Arend't Banality of Evil than its predecessor in a sense that dehumanizing acts were done in 1965 without no one taking responsability for them and a hopeful idea behind the protagonist's will to still see humans and not complete and total inhuman beasts in the atrocious killers he interviews. A must watch after its main companion."
tt3521134,"Nominated for an Oscar for Best Documentary in 2015This is a sequel/companion documentary to THE ACT OF KILLING (2012) about the genocide in Indonesia, this time seen from the POV of the family whose one of its members been murdered.Everything about this is strange. From the calmness of the people talking about the killings, to the calmness of the members of the victim's family. It's like everything is either trivial or told from a distance.Plus, there is the strange situation of people talking about forgetting and forgiveness, while obviously remembering everything and basically threatening the brother. Again, very strange feeling throughout the entire movie.Like the previous film, there is a strange feeling of trivializing genocide and brutally murdering of people. I thought the first movie was better constructed. This film feels like bits and pieces of interviews without a real coherent structure."
tt3521134,"It's weird how a documentary can make something as deplorable as killing another human being a chilling experience. If the killings that happened in Indonesia were shown on the screen in all their gory detail, there's a certain point where a viewer's mind just shuts off from all the violence. It's almost too much to watch, which is why interviews with those who did the killings is a different and almost more horrifying way to go about exposing this barbaric event. The Look of Silence (2014) is a tough movie to watch, but it is crucial for understanding how anyone could do something so vile.Put in the framing of an optometrist trying to confront his brother's killers, The Look of Silence has this quiet, stoic energy about the horrific killings in Indonesia. I was in shock when these men talked so candidly, openly, and unabashedly about the atrocities they did to other people. There was no shame in what they did. They were either following orders or felt that it was their divine right to rid the world of these people in the most violent ways imaginable. The things they did to ""remain sane"" were just as gruesome.The cinematography of these series of interviews was quite stunning, even if some shots hold on for too long. I was also in awe of the calm and collected nature of the interviewer, as he was talking with the very people who had brutally killed his brother. He didn't want retribution or revenge. I think he just wanted closure, or at least for these men to start to realize what they had done. Perhaps these men were only part of an older generation who thought that the killings they did were acceptable acts. By modern sensibilities, I hope people like this never come to power anywhere ever again.A horrifying examination of killers who didn't know they were wrong, I give Look of Silence 4.5 stars out of 5."
tt4908644,"Not really, but it still is quite the ordeal and quite the ... well almost crazy thing to be watching this right now. While there is a war going on in Ukraine - a war that is unnecessary. Not that any war is actually and really necessary. But this one is especially hard to stomach.Bill Maher made a joke about one of Russias reasons to invade Ukraine (2022 that is): they claim that they are afraid Ukraine might get WMDs ... anyone who has a little knowledge of history knows the Americans did something similar some time ago ... that aside when I heard about the invasion I felt sick to my stomache. There is no reasoning and no valid reason for this to happen - no even if Ukraine or their politics ""provoked"" (mocked?) Vladimir Putin ... this is not even close to a valid argument for war. Don't even go down that road.So what to do, than to watch this documentary? Yes a glutton to punishment - no pun intended. I can watch this documentary from the safety of my couch or wherever I sit and watch, but the people here where fighting for their lives. And the camera does not shy away - we see the consequences of violence, we see the results of people being beaten or shot at. And it does not look pretty ... and yet the people of Ukraine will not give up .. they will not surrender, they will not give in.Harrowing and really grim, this may be a history lesson but one that I would imagine not many want to watch. Sean Penn apparently is in Ukraine right now - and he is allegedly doing another documentary about what is happening right now ... as if the pandemic was not enough madness this had to happen ..."

The 2014 revolution rightly known as The Revolution of Dignity started with few hundreds gathered at the Maidan as a response to a FB call put out by the journalist Mustufa Nayyem and in the days to come, the Maidan would be filled with hundreds of thousands of protesters. It ended after 93 days that left 125 people killed. 65 missing and some 1900 injured! It resulted into Berkut (special police forces) being disbanded, Yanukovych fleeing to Russia and was given asylum by Putin and Ukrainians triumphing as it signed for EU.This documentary is a horrendous veracious account of the events that took place during those 93 days. A direct diatribe against Russians ongoing meddling into country's politics. It will hit your bloodstream and nervous system. It may seem single dimensional but this is a revolution against a leader who was merely a Russian puppet. How Bertuts rifles got loaded with live ammo instead of the standard rubber bullets against the peaceful protesters. The triumph however, was short-lived as soon Russia sent military forces to assist pro- Russiann separatists and annexed Crimea in southern Ukraine and also, the ongoing pro-Russian protests in other parts of the country that has been escalated into violent wars... crisp editing, superb footage.. Despite of missing a comprehensive history aspect, it does not fail to achieve visceral impact. A MUST see."
tt4908644,"Filled with amazing and powerful images of resistance on both a personal and mass scale, this film is what can result when you have a revolution in the age of ubiquitous cell phones and personal drones. And it leads to a kind of combination of visceral immediacy and near epic scope in the telling of the Ukraine's 3 month long citizens' revolt against a corrupt, unresponsive and lying government that would have been near impossible a handful of years earlier. This is experiencing a revolt from the inside; scary, intense, exciting – a powerful emotional roller coaster. What it isn't, is an intellectually rigorous overview of the issues and conditions that led to the revolt, or what changes did and didn't result in the long term. Those are touched on, of course, but it's a fair criticism that's been leveled against the film, that the uninformed viewer (like me) comes away with only a schematic and simplistic view of the uprising. But, for me, that was enough. The power of this film is the reminder that it is still possible for people to come together from very different places, Muslims and Catholics, left-wing students and aging military men, the poor and the middle-class – and to band together to overthrow a tyrant with a remarkable limiting of blood-shed. It's a film that will make you shed a tear for the potential for good and for change in the world, and that outweighs whatever shortcomings the film may have."
tt4908644,"I'm a Ukrainian. After watching the trailer I got goose bumps. Whatever was going on in Ukraine and things that are still happening, turned all the people very patriotic, people could see the beauty of our country, they could see how unique it is. I guess this movie means a lot for all of us. We want to stop the war in our country, so we want to create the awareness among individuals from other countries. I recommend you to watch it, so you could see what's happening on your own. In the modern world, it is so easy to manipulate people using media, so I guess this is a great opportunity for everyone to decide what he or she thinks about it, not what society does. Revolution is basically a war with society. Its aim is change for better. Many Ukrainians passed away as they wanted to bring a change. Ukrainians have not reached their aim yet, but this movie can help us to take an enormous step towards it."
tt4908644,"An inspiring documentary about the Ukrainian people's uprising against an oppressive regime and their successful demands that the Ukraine join the European Union.Two years ago, my wife and I watched all of the Academy Award nominees for Best Documentary Feature before the big show. One of them was ""The Square,"" about a similar situation in Egypt. Yet things ended badly in that film; the people fought to overthrow the regime in place but didn't have anything to replace it with, so they exchanged one bad set of leaders for another. In ""Winter on Fire,"" a major difference is that the Ukrainian people were able to organize themselves into a de facto political party, with specific demands. Their ability to focus on a specific set of objectives is largely what made their effort successful, and the sheer joy of watching people unite and effect change for the greater good made me absolutely love the Ukrainian people and hope that Americans could do the same if faced with similar challenges.Grade: A"
tt4908644,"In light of the current political climate I am in awe. Ukrainian citizens are on another level, their resilience and complete dedication to freedom and democracy is inspiring."
tt4908644,"This is a must see documentary, even if you have opposing views to those displayed in it. Although many holes are left in deciphering what is really going on within Ukraine and between Russia and Ukraine, it does allow you to get one step closer to understanding. I thought it was near perfect!I am an American living in Kiev for a few months and have been wanting to learn more about this incredible country and the trouble it has been and is facing. I found this review very informative and patriotic. It was helpful in understanding the people and the current situation and I even gained some Ukrainian pride myself!"
tt4908644,"This astonishing documentary tells the story of the Ukrainian uprising of 2014. Considering what's happening in 2022, everyone should see it. Although it doesn't offer an in depth analysis from all sides, which isn't really surprising given the odious nature of the regime at the time, it was filmed within the demonstrations and by the demonstrators, and is often a devastating and horrific account given the brutality of the regime's reaction. It is often hard to watch, however, it's also ultimately inspiring and impressive, and is a great tribute to the tenacity and fighting spirit of the Ukrainians, their hopes for their country then , and now."
tt4908644,"This documentary is raw and bloody, and it describes the internal struggle of the Ukrainian people to overthrow a dictator who betrayed them. Ukraine wanted to become part of the European Union and to move away from Putin's Russia in late 2013. The pro-Russian leader of the Ukraine Victor Yanukovich stunned the people of his country by refusing to sign an agreement to join the EU and, instead, endorsed a plan to become part of Putin's Russian alliance. The Ukrainian people took to the streets of the capital city. What followed was a bloodbath as armed troops murdered unarmed civilians. The film shows an incredible degree of courage and determination to fight back against the government troops even when much blood was running in the streets.As the people took to the streets in greater numbers, Yanukovych assumed greater dictatorial power through the Parliament and attempted to rule an unwilling public through force. The film covers a period of about 90 days from the beginning of the uprising to the resignation of Yanukovych, who fled to Russia for protection from his people. The government escalated the violence throughout the uprising, but the Ukrainians were relentless in pursuit of a free country and their desire to become part of the European Union.I wonder why we didn't get much news about this in our media, although I am grateful that we got the full story on the Kardashians while this was happening. Is Lamar out of rehab yet?"
tt4908644,"In a historic moment when a dictator have started a cruel and bloodless war in Europe (only him by the way, not Russia) maybe all the Europeans and American viewers can have the opportunity of see this wonderful documentary on how the Ukraine people has stand up against the tyranny and cruelness of Vladimir Putin since he invaded Crimea in 2014. Ukrainian are so inspiring, and their president Zelensky is now became a global icon, something that Putin isn't. Slava Ukraine and Down with Dictators!"
tt4908644,"A very interesting documentary, great footage with inspiring people fighting for a cause they believe in. The viewer is presented to an idealistic, but informative account of the uprising in Kiev, Ukraine. We follow the events through Euromaidan, following demonstrators in their revolt against Yanukovych. We also get a glimpse of the different types of protesters, their Ukrainian nationalism and pro-European sentiment. This, along with the documentary's footage, is what makes ""Winter on Fire"" great.Even though I would recommend this documentary, it's important to note that the documentary is very biased. We hear almost nothing about what's going on in the Ukrainian Parliament, it leaves out facts and generally paints a very one-sided picture. Either way, watch it."
tt4908644,"I've been to Kyiv and seen Maidan Square. I've seen the photos of the people who died lining the street. This is the story of a country fighting to be a free, democratic nation, free from the grip of Putin. As you can see by current events, Putin will do anything to stop Ukraine from being truly free."
tt4908644,"As these events occurred an extremely recent history, I followed the events that took place loosely, with what I could regard as having an informed opinion of them – although not the full picture. What Winter On Fire achieves is to bring you face-to-face with the events that occurred over those months, something that it captures excellently. Hats off to all involved, and again shows how Netflix is asserting it's dominance and reputation.Beautifully edited and extremely linear, what I was impressed most with is WoF's attention to detail in showing the audience the struggles and turmoil of this dark period in Maidan. The piece really does immerse, with some very captivating hand-held shots.Winter On Fire is definitely worth the time, and am struggling not to give it a higher star rating – as far as the film goes it is brilliant. Where this film does potentially lack, however, is that it would need to include a more well-rounded view of all the surrounding events; I am aware that this film is an account of those involved, but needs more description around outside events."
tt4908644,"Is this documentary depicting the massive NED-investments in a westernised Ukraine and how Tech Camps at e.g. The US Embassy in Kiev inspired internet activists who would fight for western values? Does it mention that Janukovitj didn't commit a crime when he paused the EU-agreement? Does it explore his actual reasons for that? Does it describe his dislike of the russian and EU pressure? Does it question the claim that he was pro-russian? Does it investigate the Right Sector involvement in the sniper shooting affair in Kiev, which was blamed on Janukovitj? Does it point out the Nuland/Pyatt evidence of US involvement in the coup? Does it mention Poroshenko and other oligarchs financing the Maidan camping and western advert-firms marketing the protests in the world media? Does it describe that most of the southeastern population in Ukraine was against the overthrow of Janukovitj? Is the murderous fire in Odessa, which killed +50 anti-Maidan activists, while radical right forces praised Bandera, mentioned? Do we hear about the C-14 and the other streetbands?Just asking. Most western documentaries does not - and therefore many people are seriously poor informed on the events, that exploded the east/west conflict with Ukraine as the epicenter.Finally, I will ask all viewers to take a good long look at 07:40 in the movie. This activist says that Ukraine wants to be part of the civilised world, meaning having a close relation to Russia would be turning to the jungle. Pure ethnocentrism, colported as the ambition of freedom by this Netflix-production.Watch Ukraine on fire, The hidden truth about Ukraine 1+2, Ukrainian agony, Roses have thorns and The masks of revolution. They are alla available on various streaming sites and youtube."
tt4908644,Quer saber o VERDADEIRO significado de PATRIOTISMO? De coragem? De união e propósito? Esse chocante documentário é então imperdível para você. Fiquei muito impressionada. Want to know the TRUE meaning of PATRIOTISM? Courage? Of union and purpose? This shocking documentary is then a must for you. I was very impressed.#movieslover #netflix
tt4908644,"Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom is a 2015 Netflix-produced documentary, directed by Evgeny Afineevsky, which focuses on the ninety days of protests, referred to as the Euromaidan Protests, that spanned from November 2013 to February 2014, which eventually toppled the government of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. It was set off when this leader of the Eastern European country, a former Soviet Republic, refused to sign a trade agreement with the European Union, which the people wanted and which he had said he would sign, in order to pay favor to Russia and Vladimir Putin. The people see the cronyism and the corruption, and are determined to peacefully show their displeasure, in the streets, eventually numbering in the thousands. The government doesn't take kindly to this popular uprising, feeling threatened easily by public opposition (as autocratic regimes often do), and sets about to repress and squash their movement. The response from the people is, as has occurred with authoritarians doing similar oppression, is to not cower but step up harder and louder and grow their movement.Putting the politics aside--though I don't think it should be in any way be considered a controversial statement that the government acted in a very bad way--this is a fantastic, disturbing, and beyond all a riveting documentary, including amazing footage placing you in the heart of these heart-stopping scenes and put together well. It shows very well how the movement started and how it grew. I think I even liked this better than another really strong Netflix doc about a similar kind of revolution in Egypt earlier in the decade, the award-winning The Square, though this is many ways is a slighter film. I believe the narrower focus, putting it on these specific protests and the governments overreaction, works to its benefit. Afineevsky received both Academy Award and Emmy nominations for the film, which on the one hand I find strange, because the two award shows are clearly in separate entertainment entities, and a work probably shouldn't be eligible for both; on the other hand, I can't say he wasn't deserving for both nomination (the same thing happened to the director of The Square Jehane Noujaim, won some Emmys for it). I highly recommend seeing this documentary."
tt4908644,"The Good: It's easy, as a person fascinated by geopolitics and political science, to sometimes ""dehumanize"" the people involved. We talk about the powerful people and speculate about the power dynamics at play; what the ""Russians"" are planning and what the fate of ""Ukraine"" will be. Often, without thinking about the human beings whose lives, welfare, hopes, and aspirations are at stake. I think it's important for anyone interested in world politics to go beyond the strategy, the ideologies and macro trends to watch documentaries that illustrate the humanity of these sweeping historical moments. Winter on Fire does this incredibly well.The footage captured here is AMAZING. Not only because of how raw it is, but how visually stunning these scenes are. Yes, it's a little weird to say this, but the contrast between the snow covered rooftops of Kiev, with the piles of burning tires, the lines of policemen and protestors, the blood, the chaos...it's honestly quite the sight to see. I also loved how this film didn't romanticize or shy away from the trauma, the violence, the desperation, and resolve required to overthrow a government. It really humanizes these events for audiences who may tend to view these things as abstract and distant.Yet, in the bloody street battles and sieging captured in this film, there are countless beautiful moments of humanity. There's a tendency to talk about Ukraine as a doomed country; how it's the second poorest country in Europe, destined to be swallowed by Russia, whose young people are either fleeing or not having enough children to maintain the country into the future. But it's hard to think this way after watching this film, honestly.The documentarian also does a fantastic job introducing us to people whom would eventually be seen as heroes in the ""new Ukraine."" Yet, it doesn't valourize anyone to the point where we lose sight of the broader social movement that Maidan really was.The Bad: The movie is a tad bit on the long side, which I can see being an issue for some. After several repeating scenes of street battles, they do sometimes blend together. I also felt the film missed a bit on the context; while I was aware of a lot of Ukrainian history up until 2014, and I can see why someone unfamiliar with this history may be a bit confused. I see it primarily as an artistic choice and completely understand why they would prefer focusing on the Maidan, but you kind of need to know a bit about the Ukrainian-Russian relationship to fully get the picture.The Ugly: Winter on Fire is essential for anyone who is fascinated by this region of the world. The event post-Revolution are what the international media focus on; the proxy war between the EU and Russia, the Donbass War and annexation of Crimea. Yet, almost forgotten is the 93 day struggle that led to the sea change in European geopolitics seven years ago. It is one of the most compelling, accessible, and enthralling documentaries I've seen in quite a while, and perhaps, even more important today than in 2015."
tt4908644,I don't even know where to start as regards the events portrayed. Such courage in the face of adversity and death. The Euromaidan protests changed the path the country was going and instilled a sense of patriotism in a whole generation.This documentary is very balanced and complete. My Ukrainian friend says its spot on as regards their fight for freedom. Some of the best footage of this historical event. Even if you are not specifically interested in the Ukraine... certainly how a peaceful protest can get big and persist for months should be worth seeing. I certainly drew parallels to protests in my native Brazil... though my people do not have or need the same courage. Watch it... learn...
tt4908644,"This is one of my favourite documentaries for many reasons. This doco is quite shocking in many ways - the lengths to which the police brutality goes to, but also how this whole conflict seemed to be but a brief mention in many countries news bulletins. I couldn't believe that these events were not more widely shared on social media, news outlets and that there wasn't worldwide outrage at these crimes. Sadly, it seems to me that this would've happened if it occurred in a country like my home country, New Zealand, but because it was based in the Ukraine, it seems like many Western countries just don't care enough.Winter on Fire had me crying and feeling emotional throughout all its heroic and sadly fatal moments. There are so many heroes in this story, and so many positives on display of what non-violent protesting can accomplish and how bad it can make your opposers look. I'm sure this was something the people of Ukraine were very proud of. The footage in this doco is truly amazing, both those who courageously filmed it and also the giant admin task of collecting it altogether and putting it in one place to tell such a compelling story. This doco moved me and also gave me such a feeling of rage to the injustices presented here.It's very sad to think that these things are still possible in our day, and these docos need to be made continually to show how truly evil the human heart without God can be. Selfishness and a thirst for power or dominion at all costs is an ugly human trait, but the unity, grit, passion and courage of the very same people shines so clearly. Some of the more compelling scenes were those of the mothers pleading with the armed forces to remember the Ukraine of their youth and that they could change sides.This is not for causal viewing and this story needs to be told, not swept under the rug, hidden, ignored or forgotten."
tt4908644,"The Maidan unrest in Ukraine is one of the most impactful civilian unrests in contemporary times. The scope and the sequence of Ukraine's revolution is the subject of this harrowing documentary. Using interview accounts from known and unknown figures of the protests, ""Winter on Fire"" wistfully tackles the growth of the revolution, from humble beginnings of persuading the government to integrate with the European Union to powerful struggles to overthrow President Viktor Yanukovych. The raw video footage of the peaceful protests-turned-civilian riots will surely unnerve the senses of how much tormenting the revolution was. Though it centers more on the protesters and their experiences, the documentary also holds no bar of portraying the state as an antagonistic figure but a difficult challenge to overcome.I watched this without subtitles. And thankfully I did because it truly connects the country's weary conditions to every viewer, with the wise use of raw footage, powerful montages and emotional interviews that deliver a gut-wrenching picture of the fight for freedom."
tt4908644,"To start with the positive: The movie is well-made, nice but sometimes really shocking and graphic pictures showing Kiev at war. I really liked the individual approach of getting to know the background stories of some of the people involved. However, and that it is why it got some points deducted - it is terribly one-sided. One has no idea how the government reacts to it or what they do to calm the situation. It would have been nice to include a local as well as a global insight into politics here. Furthermore, a link to how things are now is missing too. A simple reference in the credits on how this has developed into a division of the country would have been sufficient (at least for me)."
tt4908644,"It must be stated, that this is not a ""Documentary"" in a way as most people expect a movie under such name tag to be. History Channel type of documentaries only are made decades or centuries after the events it covers. This movie is more of a message or a inside view in the protest- made Revolution. This movie shows how a simple non-violent student protest for a Pro- European Ukraine, resulted in a genuine revolution. It did not throw out bland charts and historians, talking about the long term effects and etc. It shows the events through the eyes of the protesters. It shows the brutal acts of the police, BERKUT and the Titushki. It is very emotional and shocking. All those live streams and news segments I watched during the time it all happened, do not hold a candle to the level of detail of this movie. Of course, there will be Pro-Kremlin trolls that will scream bloody murder and will use ridiculous statements to defend the actions of the police. This movie is not for them because it will not agree to their echo chamber mentality. This is a movie about people that believe in freedom of speech, democracy and human dignity. This is a great peace, an excellent way to commemorate the sacrifice made by the people in Maidan. The people that risked death, so that they could live in a free country and be in charge of their own destiny. Slava Ukrayini! Heroyam slava!"
tt4908644,Inspiring and confirmation as to why this is going to be an unwinnable war for Russia. They have no chance of retaining this country long term whatever the outcome of the fighting. Required viewing for the youth of this country. In fact required viewing for everyone.
tt4908644,"This should have been good. It should have opened my mind to what I and the whole world had not seen in the frontlines of the Maidan protests of 2014. Yet with all of it's interviews with people who were there, it almost never gives a detailed account of any of their day to day experiences nor personal lives, instead relying on ""we demand our freedom"" rhetoric voiced over and over and over and over and over to the sound of (though beautiful) swelling violins.It just felt as a missed opportunity to get some real insight into the actual personal stories of those who were there but the only new things it showed was some footage of the brutality of the Berkut. I'm all for seeing the footage, I've never seen but make it important. Include real lives. Here we just have a propagandic advertisement for the revolution. The exact opposite result of what these people were standing and fighting for."
tt4908644,"First off, the production value is through the roof. There's technically nothing wrong (that stands out at least) about this documentary. It's like many others by Netflix, it's sleek and compelling. From that position, there's nothing wrong with it. Unfortunately, this would fall in the realm of ""propaganda"" more than ""documentary"" (which several other Netflix documentaries do as well.)There is another documentary that came out a year later called ""Ukraine on Fire"" which isn't as sleek and emotional as this one, but has far more context and sacrifices emotion for factual information. So if you want to be ""feel"" something about this situation, by all means, watch this. But if you want to ""know"" something about this situation, watch the other one.I won't go into too many details so we can avoid spoilers, but this movie left me (because I watched it before ""Ukraine on Fire"") with a lot of questions. There are a lot of things presented which in the flow of story telling don't need to be explained, but any thought after watching you'll probably find yourself saying ""Wait that doesn't make any sense."" or ""How is that even possible?"" and in one situation ""That's literally impossible.""Again, it's a nice movie and it certainly makes you ""feel"" something, but it's like your friend who was in a fight explaining to you how the fight started: ""I was just walking down the street, minding my own business. Being a perfect angel like I always am and this guy just came over and punched me for no reason."" When it reality, he was mouthing off to someone and shoved him first. So take the ""truth"" of it with a grain of salt."
tt5192124,"The last 10 minutes are like unlike anything I've ever seen in a comedy special.Bo really has his own special away of making ""Happy""."
tt5192124,"It's not really my type of humor, but the guy is genuinely talented and passionate about delivering something with substance, and that should be valued."
tt5192124,"I know I said I wasn't posting another review for a while, but I have a couple days free so here you are.I've been following Bo Burnham since ""words words words"" and ever since 2010 his work has only improved (I'll have to rewatch ""what""). It's clear to me that he is an extremely intelligent person who understands humanity.He injects personal more ""serious"" elements into his act which actually resonate with me a lot. He touches on mental health/illness which is something that has affected me for a long time, he touches upon this among other things.All the songs are great, I especially enjoyed the country song, it's perfect satire and commentary on modern music as a whole, not just country music.I could talk about Bo Burnham for ages but I'm not going to. He's one of the most intelligent celebrities working today, I feel this way about a few comedians funnily enough.Before you go, if you don't mind answering I have a genuine question... Are you happy?"
tt5192124,"It is scary or even frightening to see a ground-breaking, innovating performer like Burnham be this unhappy. Fighting his fans who see in him the role model he doesn't want to be. Terrified of today's commercial based entertainment industry which he ridicules over and over again to convince his audience stop looking for answers in the words of performers. Seeing the irony of his own fans blindly following the young comic this one hour special consist of a constant fight between Burnham and his audience with a goal to make them really listen. Where his previous shows 'What' and 'Words,words words' showed a generally happy kid making fun of everything about performing, 'Make happy' shows an angry, depressed soul begging for answers. This dark, mind-bending moving one-hour piece which elevates from being a stand-up piece to being existential monologue makes you wonder. What does it take to be satisfied?"
tt5192124,"I'm a long time fan of Bo Burnham (started seeing his stuff on YouTube back when he was in his bedroom) and every special he's put out has left me feeling different. Words Words Words made me see art differently, especially performance art. What made me question how I think and perceived my identity.But Make Happy made me realize how shitty being a creative can be and how ageist the society at large can be surrounding ideas of love and acceptance.This show explores the system surrounding commercialism of the music industry, how the rich shape the minds of the poor, how being down to earth can be an act, and how looking okay is a mask.I loved the show. I felt awkward and uncomfortable when facing the realness of depression and working through it because life must go on. I laughed at the impressions, at the face value jokes, at the wordplay, and the interesting lyrics. I teared up at the end because it's hard to put into words how fleeting happiness is...And Bo captured it."
tt5192124,"I have watched it already a couple of times but never saw the ending of the special after the standup. That 5 minutes end after the standup. Man, I don't even remember the last time I cried watching something. Standup is good, but it doesn't even hold a candle to the emotional ending. If you have netflix account, watch it from start to finish. By the end, you will be crying with laughter and at the end, you will have real tears of emotion. Do watch it."
tt5192124,"It's rare that a comedy show makes you think hard about the world, about your relationships, and gives you concern for the happiness of the performer. Make Happy does all this at once, wrapped up like a burrito that's too full.I watched on Netflix, then a second time that same night with a group of friends. Then a third time with a new group of friends a week later. And honestly, I'd gladly watch it again this week.There were plenty of burst out laughing moments. There were plenty of clever classic Bo songs that mocked the state of ""mainstream"" problems and the way the public thinks. There were tons of jokes, then there were some very serious mentions of mental health, depression, and trying to appease the crowd (all of us.) All-in-all it was an incredible performance, unique, hilarious, and deep. A refreshing new dip into your standard stand-up comedy routine.At only an hour, it's not too long that you'll feel like you wasted your time even if you hated it, and will leave you satisfied, yet begging for more if you love it. If you're reading this, give it a try."
tt5192124,"Bo Burnham does it again... I've only been following Bo for about a year so I was excited to see that he was going to make another comedy special! I really enjoyed ""what."" and I couldn't wait to see his new innovative material. What I got was very unexpected.This special is not comedy, it is art. From the deep lyricism in the last act to the cinematic camera-work throughout, this show took my breath away. I never thought that a comedy special could be so... well... special! It's truly not you everyday stand-up comedian.When compared to ""what."", the jokes are realistically not as strong. I was going to give this a 9 at first, but then I realized that I was comparing apples to oranges. I think ""what."" is a 10/10, but I wouldn't lower the score because it's as not deep as ""Make Happy""!In conclusion, don't watch ""Make Happy"" expecting a full on comedy show. The comedy is pretty good for about 3/4's of the special, but the last quarter is not a happy fun time. If you want some really good comedy, go watch Bo Burnham's other special, ""what.""."
tt5192124,"I have fell in love with this man's mind. If you think you know what true comedy is and you don't know Burnham, you really don't know what true comedy is."
tt5192124,"I rewatched this after the release of, Inside, and I have to say - The lyrics to the finale was ""Mr. Burnham"" (what.) (See what I did there?) opening up about his mental struggle with stage anxiety. But, without any previous context its hard to truly understand or appreciate that he was writing about hiding what he was going through and his inability to continue preforming. Hits pretty hard. Bo Burnham remains on a level that he created and, to me, sits above the rest.More than just a comedy special/10."
tt5192124,"Review for those, who liked it but not too much. There are a lot of simple jokes on this special and sometimes you may consider it not really funny, but needless to say, the show is amazing on the technical side. Everything is perfect. And the ending is great, still funny and clever, but with something more. If you decide to watch it, you will have a nice time."
tt5192124,"Burnham's most well crafted and honest stand-up to date. A performance that is both a slap in the face and a warm embrace to Sartre cliche ""hell is other people"". Sartre suggests we can not escape the judgment of each other, and Burnham laments a life lived in that judgmental spotlight. Burnham then flips the idea and adds a fear of the darkness outside the public gaze.This leaves the audience wondering if the spotlight is truly a product of the external world, or is it a brightness radiating from within. Is our happiness self-determined, does it come from others, or is there a codependency to happiness? Maybe Burnham was right before, maybe life on earth could be heaven and we could all make happiness. Maybe we just need to try...."
tt5192124,"""Come and watch the skinny kid with a steadily declining mental health and laugh as he attempts to give you what he cannot give himself.""66/100Hitting on Burnham out of the blue with Inside gave me this strange sight of contentment, his classification for his humor feels like an aspect a ton of people may be able to identify with, yet nothing quite like it has still come fully upon...The most substantial problem I have with this special in particular weren't just the micro aggressive jokes that might've been a good idea to swerve even back in 2016, but the fact that, even though the obvious intent for making the special feel like ""too much"" or to ask for permission to get away with that sense of intolerability have only that intent, which as a result makes them funny, the show lacks depth, only at the end we got to see that particular self-deprecating style Burnham has grown to become proficient in.Luckily, that unpolished potential has fully reached its peak now and, at least Bo is self-aware of the problematic jokes.... I even liked some of his jokes in this, so who am I to judge?"
tt5192124,"I really don't know what is special about this special.
From the get going the jokes are pretty much flat, predictable or childish.
At the 20 minutes mark I gave up on this.Technically amazing with the interaction of prerecorded pieces and live stage, not to mention the music, but these alone cannot save a show that is not funny.I went back and watched till the end because of many times ""dat ending"" is mentioned in the comments and I have to say: not worth it at all."
tt5192124,"Watched ""what."" some time before and really liked it, so I jumped right into Make Happy, when it was uploaded on Netflix and i loved it. I have to admit, he already has gotten my favourite Comedian now and I hope for a few more shows that can make you think and laugh in a different manner than other Comedians do. Highest Recommendation on my part, obviously. And even if you didn't like it, it's just an hour long, so don't worry about ""spending too much time on something you didn't like""."
tt5192124,"The way Bo uses music in his performance really proves his originality. His shows are so unlike any other comedian I have ever seen, he is able to change mood and tone instantly allowing for some sharp and witty moments. He is able to turn any subject into a fully fledged masterclass of a joke so effortlessly. Bos facial expressions and hand gestures only improve upon hi comedic effect. Overall this performance is really strong and quite enjoyable to watch even when alone :/ noice."
tt5192124,"This Netflix original comedy special is one of the best out there. One of my top 3 along with Relative disaster and both Dave Chapelle sketches. This is one of the comedy specials that you should show your friend if he asks which comedy specials are good. But just as a warning, viewer discretion is advised when showing to kids and certain people due to some subjects being talked about like suicide and other offensive subjects."
tt5192124,"Never would I think such a unfiltered ""offensive"" comedy show could make me so emotional and reminiscent, but not sure what of. Bo is a genius in his satire, comedy, story-telling, wordplay, performance, energy and all of the above. You can see how creative he is but in this show he relates his over-the-top skits to something more real. This show comes close to being perfect not just for laughs but to feel something, you come for the gut-wrenching humor but leave with tears."
tt5192124,"I mean, of course I had to watch this after what Inside did to me.Is it as good though? Well...no. But only two complaints arose for me. One is that I don't think Bo should be saying a gay slur on stage, although the salt and vinegar joke was hilarious, and I think is only made even better when you remember he was specifically talking to all the white people in the crowd.And the other is that the opening of this special seemed to be implying that there would be a consistent theme to this, much like Inside, but there wasn't really any such thing. It goes from straight white privilege, to nursery rhyme rap, to country music slander, to Pringles cans, and I might not have minded this if the opening part wasn't there, because I was kind of expecting something more consistently going for anti-humour, and for the most part it wasn't.But that aside, this is amazing stand up. Every song is memorable, has really funny messages and lyrics, Bo is an absolutely perfect performer throughout the whole thing, he's captivating, has a great personality, and an on point sense of timing, and the lighting happening on this stage is honestly amazing.I can even say there's a few shots that impressed me from the directing, which isn't all that common for a stand up special, where all the director is really required to do is just keep the focus on the guy doing the funnies.So I wasn't let down after Inside, which is a pretty amazing feat all by itself, and I can't wait to see his other special too."
tt5192124,"So this is the first show I see of him. I see the potential, I see the talent, it is something different then all the people who are just standing there and talk and talk and... So I give him one extra point for that.While it is different then most of the comedians, I have seen it much better, more clever and much more suprising then this. The jokes are mostly about making fun of something or about something sexual. And there is always something with music or effects, it is too much for me. It are just small pieces that have to be together because it must be one hour and that should not be a problem if the jokes were more in depth, more clever.I have the feeling he can be much more then this. He makes fun of how a song is being made, but it annoys me that many comedians on Netflix have an intro and outro. Why?! It makes no sense for me. But this intro was a nice one I must say. Maybe it is the high light of the evening ;)."
tt5192124,"Yet again Bo delivers an extraordinary blend of existentialism, social commentary, witty humour, catchy songs and, above all, a handful of masturbation jokes. I have personally been a fan since early on as he was making YouTube videos and loved his first Netflix collaboration 'what.' and 'Make Happy' in my opinion is further development for Bo as his show starts to take on more of his unique onstage personality and the best vocals I have seen from him. Overall it is a unique experience with some genuine laughs and also questions of the human experience.8.5/10JH"
tt5192124,Is this supposed to be comedy? Why does he need to sing? Absolutely awful.
tt8784906,Director has done the exceptional job and all actors have given the best performances to make this excellent biopic. And what can i say about Subodh. He is already proved himself in 'Balgandharv' with his intense acting. While watching this movie i feeled like It's actual Kashinath and not Subodh anywhere.
tt8784906,"Its always challenging to present biography of any popular person on screen as people have their own concepts about that person and they may have read books,heard news about that person or seen him.
And if it is about popular and complicated person like Dr.Kashinath Ghanekar it is more difficult.
But Abhijeet Deshpande has succeeded in lifting this bow of Lord Shiva!
Subodh Bhave has done full justice to the character and is supported by Prasad,Sonali,Vaidehi,Sumit ,Nandita etc.
The make up artist has failed in showing the growing age of any character as the story covers so many years.
The inner conflits of a narcissist actor and his downhill journey is well portrayed but it doesn't touch you emotionally and you remain just a spectacter without getting involved.
Also that particular period is not exactly elaborated (so it remains a drama on screen)"
tt8784906,At the end Dr. Ghanekar couldn't do his comeback on stage. His audience lost their legendary Hero.... It hurts a lot!! But....but now he did his grand come back again through this movie. Subodh had done an excellent job! While watching movie you just see Dr. Ghanekar on screen and not Subodh. Can't understand who is superior. There's still magic in Dr. 's name. Subodh had completed Dr.' s dream of come back!!!!!! Hearty congratulations to the team and especially Subodh!!
tt8784906,"Best depiction of the story of first marathi superstar, his personal life, his friends and family, his ups and downs all are shown very gracefully.. It is a must watch for all of them who want to know his contribution to marathi cinema !!"
tt8784906,"Hats off to Subodh Bhave for taking such efforts. Excellent casting and no one will do rather than you. Also, Sonali Kulkarni and Sumit Raghvan did superb work. Waiting for next biopic."
tt8784906,This film tells the real definition of natak..hatts off 😍😍 subodh bhave great work...kashinath ghanekar sir the bestest
tt8784906,"What a great actor Subodh is, thrilled by his performance ."
tt8784906,Subodh Bhave and the entire cast has done an exceptional job in portraying the Marathi theatre dynamics of the 70's. Watch it for the awesome performance of Subodh Bhave
tt8784906,"Only after seeing this movie did i came to know about the legend named Dr. Kashinath Ghanekar. I have been hearing the two classic songs featured in this film since my childhood but only after seeing this movie did i come to know that it featured the legend. The biggest plus point of the film along with pace of the movie was the performance of its main cast and supporting actors whether it is Subodh Bhave (who is becoming a master of acting in biopics) or Sumeet Raghavan or Prasad Oak or Suhas Palshikar and many more & the chemistry between all the actors were equally good especially the scenes featuring Oak & Bhave. But the shooting locales & the sets featured in the film did not feel authentic and at times the flow of the film trudges the path similar to what we see in other biopics (i.e. the rise and fall of the personalities).When the result for the national awards were being announced i felt that this year it should be given to Subodh Bhave for the best actor performance but those hopes were dashed. Hope he gets a National Award for the best actor in the future. The reason being that Marathi actors apart from Nana Patekar, Sachin Khedekar or Shreeram Lagoo have not received the desired recognition.(On a funny note if Ayushmann Khurrana has in mastered in acting in films of social taboo then Subodh Bhave has mastered in films of biopic genre. )"
tt8784906,"Dear readers,What a movie!!!!!!!!! I am amazed with Mr. Subhodh Bhave's performance, an excellent star cast and screenplay. I am a hardcore Marathi Cinema fan and this movie was a great tribute to Dr. Kashinath Ghanekar. I felt like an old soul while having an opportunity to watch behind the scenes of my most favorite song - ""Shoor Amhi Sardar..."" I literally sang that song during the movie (haha!). I want to watch this movie again, but unfortunately, I am in Boston, MA, wherein the movie only ran through last weekend and Monday! So much for being a Marathi movie fan!!Lots of respect for Subhodh Bhave and the entire star cast!
Three cheers to Mr. Abhijit Deshpande."
tt8784906,"Ani... Dr. Kashinath Ghanekar: Just as the title of this movie, the director depicts exactly the thrill and power of the name every time we hear with a deafening applause by the crowd. This is about the personal and professional character of the best theater artist in that era. The craze and passion of performing on stage as an actor made Dr. Kashinath pay huge prices. Very well explained on how the character gets addicted to praises from the viewers and when the time changes, the same profession takes a toll on him. Nearly a sole performance by Subodh Bhave who has nailed the character. His way of characterization just sticks in your head even after the movie. Also brilliantly accompanied by Sumeet Raghavan and Prasad Oak with stunning screen presence. There is a similar touch to the direction as that of Natsamrat which revives the contemporary Marathi stage acting. The movie has everything from struggle to the stardom and downfall to the rise. The name Dr. Kashinath Ghanekar itself had a unique, crazy, charismatic attraction which drew the crowd to the theater in any circumstances. The movie is a bit stretched and the climax is not as great as the whole script was written.
Rating: 7/10"
tt8784906,Defames sambhaji Maharaj by showing false history.Hatred campaign by Brahmin writer against sambhaji Maharaj
tt8784906,This will be the milestone of Indian Cinema and Subhodh bhave is new perfectionist. Every Cinema lover should enjoy this movie.
tt8784906,"The movie has all the essential elements to make it one of the best movie of all time..It ticks all the boxes , be it casting or performance of characters or the storyline.
The hard work and dedication of the actors shows in their performances.
Subodh bhave as Dr. Kashinath ghanekar is outstanding!👍
Kudos the team of Ani..Dr. Kashinath Ghanekar !"
tt8784906,Once again a great performance by Subodh Bhave. Everyone will remember Subodh Bhave As Dr. Kashinath Ghanekar. Whole squad did fantastic job. Very good screenplay and fantastic direction. Special to see : Subodh Bhaves last appearance and 100th show as Sambhaji Maharaj. And lastly Sumit Raghavan as well.
tt8784906,"What a performance by subodh bhave
He has proved all these years
What an amazing actor he is !"
tt8784906,"Superb performances, & music. Even the new faces have also done the fabulous job. Personally I was confused between this movie & TOH. Because of the positive reviews I did turn to this movie, and this movie did not disappoint me. Good job. The performances of all make you involve in the movie. You will love Kashinath, and even hate him. A worth watch movie."
tt8784906,This film has the potential to take you to a wonderful journey. You will truly experience the life of a brilliant stage actor who also happens to be the first superstar of the marathi theatre stage. Subodh Bhave has again managed to impress the audience with his dazzling performance on the screen. I will recommend everyone to watch this beautifully made biopic of a blazing and thunderous legend.
tt8784906,"ANI DR KASHINATH GHANEKAR REVIEW-Teasers and trailer of the film had created so much hype that one might have had humongous expectations especially knowing the fact that Biopic is the genre which increases the chances. Film fulfills its Writing and Story entirely but unfortunately does not reach the high level bar. This problem usually appears just because the film carries a burden of huge expectations, so even Good films looks Average. Another reasons is, Subodh Bhave has done 2 Biopics before, out of which one was a Classic and the other one too went on to receive good response. Kashinath probably carried the burden of these 2 films like, will Subodh make an Hat-trick this time? He certainly does but again how far he goes, not really far honestly.Ani Dr Kashinath Ghanekar has a Big Acting team loaded with Big names. Starting with Subodh Bhave, he's Phenomenal, his looks, his dialogue delivery, his Versatility, he has just explored an Actor himself even more widely this time. Prasad Oak does justice to his role, Vaidehi Parahurami looks cute. Sonali Kulkarni somehow manages to bring that Somberness of Sulochana Didi. Other cast members are brilliant too. Writing is Excellent considering we knew its a true story so the truth has to be there rather than filmy non-sense just to make a film out of it. Screenplay is kind of Very simple as it doesn't really offer any entertainment or wow factors. Music is somewhere on down side but the Background score recovers that loss. Abhijeet Deshpande as Writer wins it but as a Director of the film, destination is far away. Some more reaserch, quite more attention towards quality and this film would have reached that expected height.There were many Legends in Marathi Cinema and drama world and we have so many stories to make films on them instead of wasting time and money doing remakes hence Ani Dr Kashinath Ghanekar deserves the Respect for choosing this subject and moreover attempting it fully with tremendous efforts and on large scale. Expecting a Classic isn't a Crime but it surely reduces the impact of the film. There were 'Balgandharva' kind of vibes passing throughout teasers and trailer, obviously that film had Genius director like Ravi Jadhav though, Ani Dr Kashinath couldn't match that level yet manges to gift you a good product this Diwali with unbelievable story to tell.RATING- 6/10*"
tt8784906,"Nice and must watch movie.........
Marathi film is growing very well..
Start of new era of marathi film"
tt8784906,Theater lover mush watch this movie. very well directed with some of the best oin industry.
tt8784906,"It's a masterpiece movie and should be awarded. Direction is good. Actors Subodh,Sumeet,Vaidehi,etc everyone done superb acting. Really appreciating movie. It is a diamond of Marathi Film Industry. Very different from those typical Marathi stupid and dumb movies."
tt8784906,"The casting of Subodh Bhave as the titular character is just perfect. He wins our heart with his performance. This film portrays the good and the bad shades of the legendary actor, Dr Ghanekar. But in the end, this is what makes you love him more, for he would not have been the first superstar if he didnt have grey shades.Overall, an amazing movie after a long time in Marathi cinema. A must watch!"
tt10810424,"Dave still reliably dropping some awkward truth bombs, especially on the witch-hunt of Louis CK, the LGBTQRS folks, offence archaeology, false accusations and the terribly oppressed French actor Jussie Smollet. Some of the relentlessly anti-white-people stuff made me feel a little uncomfortable, but, to his credit, he's made a show that will make pretty much EVERYONE feel a little uncomfortable at some point or other, and that's something we all need from time to time.His last few Netflix 'specials' have felt rougher around the edges and more haphazardly thrown together than an old-school, studiously crafted stand-up comedy movie, and this is no exception. Very little of it is ingeniously devised, laugh-out-loud jokes, and really what you're getting here is Dave Chappelle's opinions on the world today presented in a light-hearted, rambling manner. Going into it with that expectation, I found him to be a very enjoyable companion for an hour."
tt10810424,"About time stand-up did what is supposed to do...make us laugh, make us uncomfortable, make us think and make us laugh again. Dave did this and did it well.There are several instances of where Dave 'trapped' the audience by taking the joke one direction then twisting the punchline in a 180 turn which made those that was clapping realized how hypocritical they had been....and still got laughs.This is something everyone should see, but many will miss the point of the whole special and only concentrate on one joke that 'offended' them.Those that are tired of PC, want to laugh, want to learn...this is for you."
tt10810424,This performance should be required viewing for Colleges!
tt10810424,"I don't know but I've always found that a lot of the most offensive comedians are usually the funniest and most entertaining ones like Jo Koy, Ricky Jervais, etc. and Dave Chapelle is definitely one of those, making jokes about Michael Jackson, the LGBT community, Jussie Smollett, Louis CK, among others.And he also got to say what I've always thought about Anthony Bourdain's killing himself despite having one of the best jobs in the world. Incredibly entertaining for me, definitely a Must See, one of the best comedy specials on Netflix."
tt10810424,I hope Dave will change the world with this. It was brilliant.
tt10810424,"Another phenomenal standup special from Dave Chappelle. Netflix should just give him their entire budget because his specials are the ONLY ""Netflix Originals"" I have ever enjoyed from beginning to end.He takes the PC garbage we've been force-fed for the last decade, puts it in a blender, and then pours that sh** down the drain.He's the only comedian that can get away with these hilarious jokes. I should probably say he's the only comedian with the audacity and confidence to pull it off... ON NETFLIX, the biggest Neoliberal Corporate shill on the planet.WELL DONE, sir. WELL DONE. :)"
tt10810424,"Dave Chapelle flys in the face to controversy, producing comedy so refreshing in the current climate of censorious Woke-ness.He tackles on the nose topics, making the audience undulate between gasps and roaring with laughter!He evokes the best of Lenny Bruce, unapologetic, unbowed appreciating that everything is a topic for humour or nothing is.Take a bow."
tt10810424,Its been awhile since I saw someone navigate landmines with such mastery
tt10810424,"Dave Chappelle is definitely still the best comedian. This is not for the weak hearted and easily offended. Dave goes in and says what he wants. Not gonna lie, it was refreshing to hear someone truly saying jokes with no regard to ""correctedness."" My wife and I were laughing really hard the entire time. Don't listen to all the click bait news articles, they're just trying to get your clicks via outrage. Watch it for yourself, it's worth it."
tt10810424,"We thought it was truth, so sadly HILARIOUS. The only reason for the 9 instead of a 10 is because there were a few things we didn't get haha. Otherwise still love Dave!! Don't ever cave to PC culture man!!!"
tt10810424,"This special is pretty good and reminds me of old Dave even though it focuses more on politics and what's going on in the world. That's what's good about it though, it pokes fun at all the goofy things we have to deal with as a society now. He's never overly mean too so those he makes fun of shouldn't really have too much of an issue with it, he just shows that what's going on is a bit odd and points out why. He's gotten some hate for the Trans jokes but I never thought they were that bad."
tt10810424,"Always been a fan of Dave, the dude is a legend. He didn't sugarcoat anything in this special, he was brutally honest and hilarious at the same time. Dude called a spade a spade and didnt care who got offended because he knows EVERYONE gets offended by literally breathing these days. He said what everyone else is too afraid to say and did it in a way that makes you laugh. Bravo man, I hope he does more like this, sick of this PC world"
tt10810424,"Only than his early work in stand up, I'd have to say this is the best one to date. I was laughing out loud constantly and he doesn't shy away from making fun of everyone. Great show, I'll probably watch this a couple more times to be perfectly honest."
tt10810424,"Amazing as always, telling all the truths nobody dears to talk about now a days. Super smart and Funny. Dave is the best!"
tt10810424,"I rarely laugh at comedians, but Dave had me laughing the whole time.
I think it's because the topics are real and genuinely delivered, the jokes always go in a different direction to where you think they're going, and you're always left thinking about possible contradictions in what society thinks and what is reality.
Strong political and social messages in such a funny manner with fantastic punch lines, timing and delivery.
Such a fresh set, he has his fingers right on the pulse of conflicting thoughts in peoples minds on current issues and knows exactly how to make people laugh at themselves and question the norms.
I don't understand why there are people out there that can't take a step back and think about what message or question he is asking, instead of picking out words and red flagging them, like their real life is a twitter algorithm blocking and reporting naughty words."
tt10810424,Most comedians are scared they will be cancelled if they talk about a particular group or certain individuals. They have spent the last 3 years making jokes about Trump wich has become draining and not funny. I'm glad we have Dave who reminds us that there is funny any every situation
tt10810424,"You can't get better standup than this. This is the reason he is the reigning champ of comedy. Nobody nails the ""sensitive"" stuff like Dave. Congratulations Dave! You are the man."
tt10810424,"Funny, insightful, and he carries on the tradition of stand-up comedians wearing dumb outfits. He's a voice worth listening to."
tt10810424,"As someone who constantly supports no barriers within comedy, I respect and admire Dave Chappelle for the work he's put into this stand-up special. In a time when everyone is apparently allowed to make their feelings well known, we've succumbed to an age when political correctness means more than the right to free speech. And the entertainment group that gets hit the worst, are comedians.Comedians are seeing a decline in their audience, because you can sense that they're afraid to be themselves in the material they present. While folks like Kevin Hart and Aziz Ansari are riding this out based on their established audience, Ricky Gervais and Dave Chappelle are pushing forward, doing their best to show how comedy is meant to be unrestrained.With no apparent fear, Chappelle takes on the topics of school shootings, feminism, homophobia and opiod addiction, by elaborating their funnier elements. They're jokes that you're bound to make when you're drunk within a safe space, but wouldn't dare say out loud in public environments. This is exactly what we're missing. If a collective group of people can ruin a comedians life based on tweets made 15 years ago, you're effectively killing their art form. Their art is expression, and someone telling them 'how' or 'what' to express, is counterproductive.I'd encourage everyone to give this a watch. Its extremely controversial, but you need to understand why that is relevant to humor; why hearing these bits are important for comedic progression. I hope this does well enough to bring back old-school stand-up."
tt10810424,"This is the best thing I've watched on Netflix in many years, I love Dave Chappelle even more than I did when he made Chappelle's Show. We need more people like him who aren't afraid to speak their mind no matter what others think instead of everyone being so afraid they might offend somebody."
tt10810424,"First I'll say that this is funny enough to past the time for an hour. But it's certainly not vintage ""rolling on the floor funny"" Chapelle circa. 2001.Having said that, Chapelle has no boundaries and there's no line he won't cross. It's refreshing especially in this era of people being perpetually offended. He's still the insightful story teller he's always been, but a lot of the jokes are pretty superficial and only a handful have that ""funny but true, make you think"" characteristic.I love Chapelle and this was good, but if you're expecting ""Killin' Them Softly"" this ain't it."
tt10810424,This is literally Dave showing he does not care about saving his career. He lays it all out and it's hilarious! Dave shows he's one of the last true comedians left
tt10810424,It seems to me that his recent specials have been More on the commentary side than the jokey side. Like many great comedians his older stuff is much funnier in my opinion. There are no memorable bits in his new specials. For example there are no cops sprinkling crack on dead bodies. But he is always interesting to watch not only because he is funny but for his insightful views and social commentary.
tt10810424,"Dave Chappelle used to be one of my favourite comedians. These days I don't find him nearly as funny as I used to. I must have outgrown him. To be fair I can still acknowledge his talent. He has great delivery, timing, he knows how to work a crowd and can improvise if he has to. He is very good at his job and I'm not going to even try and deny that. The problem for me is his newer material. I can't relate to it the same way as I used to with his old stuff, but, honestly I don't even really like that anymore. There are some types criticising this for being offensive. I don't think that is fair. There were a few jokes I did not like, but, I'm not going to waste time complaining, I just didn't laugh at those. There are other people saying this show is edgy and brave. It isn't that either. He doesn't take any real risks in this, the world has just become so insanely politically correct so maybe it seems that way. What I will say is that I don't think he is trying as hard as he used to. His old work was quicker and there were more jokes. Now he will spend as much time doing over the top reactions to his own jokes as he will actually telling them. It gets kind of annoying. He has always been a bit smug, but, it is only getting worse. I suppose it must be difficult to stay relevant as you get older, settle down and have a family. I liked this enough to watch it, but, I will not be rewatching it and I think it is safe to say his best days are behind him. If you are a fan then you might as well watch it, but, don't expect too much from it."
tt10810424,Dave Chappelle back and firing on all cylinders with this latest video . Laugh from start to finish and if your one of these outraged soy boy from vice or similar news sites that claim you are reporter lol or have a blue tick in twitter time for you all to get a life
tt0179552,"Firstly, let me affirm most of this series IS very faithful to the source. There are times you can follow the show and the book together for pages in a row with every scene and the dialog faithful captured to screen. But for such a faithful adaptation it's astonishing how little of the depth and variety of the comics is retained.At the most basic level, the Tintin comics are adventure tales with some charming whimsy (sidetracks and double takes) and slapstick comedy... enough to appeal to an 11 year old. But there's intrigue, suspense, irony, politics, and (speaking only for the English translations) wonderful verbal humour also... material that unfolds well through one's teens and continues to appeal to an adult.So as a repeat Tintin reader for decades I was delighted to find a complete box set of DVDs of the TV series. And subsequently most disappointed with the adaptation.I've recovered from my initial disappointment to enjoy them as offered. Over the last couple of weeks I've re-watched the series from start to fin, with the books in hand as reference material, and I realise the flavour of the (usually but not always subtle) changes is consistent and intentional, with a presumption of a younger audience.A BRIEF CATALOG of adjustments in style should serve to highlight what to expect...Plot lines, sense of adventure, danger, and escape are generally well presented.Ironic humour is in general removed entirely or at least dumbed down.Any sarcastic dialog is also removed.Much of the dialog is subtly adjusted to be more straight forward.Suspense and intrigue are significantly diminished. In the comics there is often a slow unfolding as to who the major villain may be and with what motivations, but on screen they've chosen to lay details out for us as early as fit within each story. And sometimes sledgehammer the points home in case we miss them.In a couple of cases, whole major players (individuals or nations) are removed, presumably for simplification... eg in ""The Calculus Affair"" only the Bordurians appear. The Syldavian's are not mentioned.Political and economic backdrops are left out. eg in the Blue Lotus there's only the briefest mention of Japan occupying China, no mention at all of the ""International Settlement"", and aspects of the story related to those are simply left out.""Here we are, right back where we started"". Or... not. While book- Tintin may experience more or less failed attempts escaping a situation (and we get to enjoy the efforts), on screen they generally show us just his successes to keep the plot moving along.Similarly, almost all the whimsy is taken out. The sticking plaster that won't give up, the Thompsons investigating wrong lines of enquiry, etc. ... I guess to pack the ""real"" plot into the screen time they've had to drop most of the tangents.Captain Haddock doesn't drink! This significantly alters the character (eg without alcohol he's dependable) and makes for a couple of only semi-successful story adjustments.Snowy doesn't talk! He's a clever and communicative dog, just no inner dialog. This is a shame since in the comics he has some superb lines to offer.The Thompsons' banter is ... simplified to the point of being plain. You'll hear no ""Thompson, with a 'P' as in 'psychology'"", and while they say ""to be precise"" a great deal it's rarely followed by the wit of the comic. This one's a real comedown.On a number of occasions, a scene is played out ""faithfully"" but misses either quite enough setup (due to the above edits) or else adjusts a crucial turn of phrase to be more straightforward ... and thus loses the playfulness or wit that comes out in the comics.All of the above and more are a consistent editorial style serving what adults perceive would be suitable for the presumed younger audience.Overall as I say the basic sense of adventure story is preserved, the comic artwork style on screen is a match in almost all detail, and taken as presented the shows are done quite well. On *that* basis these shows are still OK entertainment.For my own taste though I would have preferred all the sidetracks, irony, charm and wit of the original to be captured even if it meant the two TV episodes per story became three. Oh well."
tt0179552,"Probably the best screen adaption of Belgium's most famous reporter, Adventures of Tintin stays faithful to the spirit and stories of original comics. The stories themselves make for brilliant adventures whether it's finding buried treasure, going to the Moon or venturing to a far off land.The animation is also of very good quality and considering that it was made on a TV budget back in 1991 is actually quite ahead of it's time, for example 'Explorers on the Moon' has one of the earliest of 3D cartoon animation. These shows will appeal to all ages and everyone is bound to have a favourite out of the various crazy characters, whether it's old sea dog Captain Haddock, the brilliant but hard of hearing Professor Calculus or even Tintin himself (not forgetting Snowy)."
tt0179552,"Unpretentious, exciting and fun, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" was great viewing despite the blandness of the title role. Being the only dull character in the team, Tintin and his smart dog Milou were a great contrast to the insane people that surrounded them: the foul-mouthed sea captain with a great vocabulary, Captain Haddock, the somewhat confused but brilliant Professor Calculus, and the always-ready French detectives Dupond and Dupondt.Throughout his adventures Tintin visited the moon, fought giant spiders, stopped wars, investigated meteorites and huge mushrooms, and unraveled mystery after mystery. And it never got boring, not once! Absolutely amazing show that can be watched again, and whose plot won't insult the intelligence of adults, either!"
tt0179552,"The previous television adaptation of the cub reporter with the Hugh Grant-type fringe and the twisted taste in legwear was in serialised five-minute form (all together now - ""HERRRGEEEE'S ADVENNNNTURRRRES OF TINTIN!!!"") way back in the 1960s; this newer version was less bite-sized in its presentation, and was much better animated as well as remarkably faithful for the most part to its source material. (Unlike virtually all other famous fictional creations, Tintin's adventures on film, TV and radio have all come from Herge's work - in accordance with his wishes, no one's allowed to concoct new stories now that the original creator is dead.)Of course, there were a few tweaks made to bring Tintin, Captain Haddock, the Thompson Twins, Professor Calculus, Signora Bianca Castafiore and the rest to television this time, but nothing story-wrecking (in the adaptation of ""The Broken Ear,"" the two villains of the piece are brought to justice alive - in the book they drown and go to Hell). The writers, animators and voice cast preserve the spirit of the tales wonderfully; Tintin may speak with a Canadian voice, but so what? It's not like the series has been thoroughly butchered. Far better than ""Tintin and the Lake of Sharks,"" and one of Nelvana's best.""PRODUCED BY TELE-HACHETTE AND BELVISION!!!!"" (The '60s one, that is. Sorry, I couldn't resist.)"
tt0179552,"I used to love watching this when I was young. I noticed that with some children/family shows, I hated them when I view them now because I sometimes see them as rip-offs or a way of making kids dumb (some of the playhouse Disney shows for example, and even some of the Asterix films). However, in this case, watching it again after a long time made me like it even more.Tintin and the Lake of Sharks was a total screw-up!!! An absolute disgrace to the comics. The voices (Captain Haddock sounding like Popeye), the ridiculous music (especially when there is one part when the two kids sing an annoying song, making it a musical), the cheap animation and a number of Tintin-related factual errors like Calculus hearing badly and hearing well most of the time, the inaccurate characters ...all of it made it horrible a movie. The series has none of these flaws.The visuals remain true to Herge's fantastic drawing style and the animation fits really well with it. The music in the series is perfect for Tintin. The humour remains the same(just as good), with a couple of clever add-ons for the Thompsons. The characters remain the same as in the comic books. The voice-cast is perfect and the voice-acting by everybody makes the characters portrayed exactly like they were in the books. The Thompsons are really hilarious and their voices were a joy to listen to, making the two detectives in the comics really come to life. My congrats to them, the voices of Tintin and Captain Haddock and the rest of the cast.The stories remain true to the books even though any fans of the books will easily spot a few differences. I am pleased to say that they actually fit really well with the episodes, because picturing some of the edited parts being identical to these parts in the book instead of being altered, just wouldn't work. And hearing me say that the stories are reasonably true to the books clearly means that they are fantastic, matching the clever imaginations and twists that Herge came up with in his books.A flawless adaptation is perhaps the best way to describe the series. Forget about that movie which rips off the books. If you want an enjoyable, loyal series, then pick this one as soon as you can."
tt0179552,"Based off of the long running comic book series. Tintin is about a young Belgium reporter and his dog Snowy who both travel and experience adventure together around the world. Tintin is kind hearted & friendly. He feels that it's an act of good to help out in other people's business. Sometimes it's a good thing to get yourself involve even if it'll endanger your life. Throughout the series, Tintin will eventually encounter new reliable friends, as well as making new enemies along the way. Life is an adventure when your with Tintin.Very few adventure/mystery series are comparable to Tintin. The brilliant idea about Tintin himself is that his background is unknown. His name is neither his surname or first name. And his childhood was never mentioned. Making his character so interesting, where you only know him as a friendly Belgium reporter. I never knew the comics existed. But when this cartoon was still new, I was very fascinated by the stories and characters. I never knew much of it's history till years later.I do know that this cartoon was made years after the creator Herge past away. And it was made because of Herge's disapproval over a non-truthful 5 minute Tintin series made several years ago. However, ""Adventures of Tintin"" reflects the original books as it was meant to be. Something Herge would of liked to see.Became an international success like the books themselves in more than 50 countries. Sadly it's coexisted here in America. But not for long, until the upcoming Tintin Movie comes out to shine it's existence. Those who like action/mystery/comedy related animated series will enjoy this series.Coming to DVD in 2008."
tt0179552,"In general, The Adventures of Tintin is very loyal to its source material, the art style is straight out of the comics, the characterization is spot on, and the music is amazing!The theme tune is, hands down, my pick for the most amazing theme tune ever! It perfectly captures the adventure element and the danger Tintin goes thorugh and is accompagnied by a visually engaging montage of clips from the series to show.Since I know the comics and is a huge fan of the famous reporter and his canine friend, I can tell that some scenes are edited to suite younger viewers, like some of the drinking scenes with Capt. Haddock for example.But that doesn't take away anything at all and I will always love The Adventures of Tintin on screen as well as on paper. Great show for everyone to enjoy."
tt0179552,Good remake. Even better or at least as good as the books
tt0179552,"""The Adventures of Tintin"" was another example of a show I used to love watching in my childhood, and I still love it now. The stories are exciting and clever, and the scripts are engaging and funny. The animation is excellent, colourful and just wonderful to look at, and the music is top notch. The voices are very well done, and the characters are appealing. Tinton is likable enough, and Snowy is very cute. Professor Calculus and Captain Haddock are both a lot of fun, with distinct personalities, but my favourites are the Thompson twins, they are absolutely hilarious. Overall, I absolutely love ""The Adventures of Tintin"", it is well animated and a lot of fun. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

As a child, Herge had a gift for drawing but never had any formal training in the visual arts. He attended both school and the boy scouts during the World War 1 and post-World War 1 era. After he finished school Herge published his first ever cartoon: ""The Adventures of Totor"". 1929, Herge introduced a cartoon about a traveling Belgium reporter , Tintin , accompanied by his fox terrier (Snowy) traveling the Soviet Union. By 1930 ,Herge published the very first Tintin book: ""Tintin in the Land of the Soviets"". After that , followed a weekly magazine in 1946 . Later on , it's published successful comic books as ¨Cigarrettes of pharaoh, Treasure of Rackam the Red ,Tintin and the scepter of Ottokar¨. Tintin soon became Herge's ""ligne Claire"" (French for clear line) legacy. The later adventures of Tintin involved other locations of the world from China ¨The blue Lotus¨ all the way to America as ¨Tintin in America¨. After completing 23 books, Herge passed away on March 3, 1983, leaving ""Tintin & the Alpha-Art"" (The 24th book) unfinished . Later on , Raymond Leblanc produced the following films: ¨Tintin in the lake of Sharks¨ and 1970 ¨Tintín in the temple of the sun¨. And recently Steven Spielberg produced and Peter Jackson directed ¨Tintin and Red Rackham's treasure¨ by means of Motion Capture technique .The series will appeal to Tintin comic-books buffs. An agreeable , fun adaptation from a great comic book. Full of humor , it's a funny and familiar entertaining for kids and grown-ups ."
tt0179552,The series stays very true to the original books and is by far my favourite adaptation of Tintin. I spent many happy Saturday mornings watching this. Give the movie a miss and enjoy the real Tintin experience.
tt0179552,"First things first, I am an avid fan of the Adventures of Tintin by Herge. What makes them so great is the intriguing world that resolves around Tintin the intrepid reporter and the Brilliant characters that portray different types of people, the hero, the drunkard, the mad scientist, opera singers, detectives and even insurers! The stories appeal to everyone as they can include humour, excitement, detective, sci-fi and just downright fun. The books are exhilarating stuff to say the least, but this is a review about the show, not the books. The adventures of Tintin could never disappoint as long as it kept to the original stories, which thankfully it did. However, there are still some unnecessary changes to characters and plots including the complete eradication of the international settlement in ""the blue lotus"". But what stops what is an exciting and interesting show from being a cult phenomenon is the child-friendliness of it all. I could go on for ages about all the changes they make to tone down the darkness of some of the books, but I'll narrow it down to the necessaries. Firstly, the fact that They've toned down Captain Haddocks drinking obsession is intolerable. And they've also taken out anything which might for a moment seem the slightest bit prejudiced. Another major disappointment is the toning down of using guns and fistfights. But now on to the portrayal of the characters themselves. Tintin being Canadian is rather annoying and Haddock sounds peculiar as well. Calculus is probably the only amusing portrayal out there but does sound too squeaky at points. The Thomson twins are fine but not perfect and Bianca Castafiore sounds more like a Scottish man than an Milanese nightingale. Because the animation was timed to the English soundtrack if you watch it in French the voices are way to rushed. Overall a great few seasons none the less with no bad episodes due mainly to Herge's craft but could have been perfect had they not intended it to be watched just by kids."
tt0179552,"I can't imagine Tintin or any other characters from the Tintin books played by actors, I just think it would botch up the characters. I can only imagine them either as comic book characters or cartoon characters. This Tintin cartoon series is as close as you could possibly get to the Tintin comic books. The characters all look and sound exactly as they do in the comic books. Each episode of the Tintin cartoon (either one or two part episodes) has basically the same story as in each of the Tintin books. Not just the same story, the same characters the same settings even some of the same quotes. I've enjoyed the Tintin cartoonseries as well as the Tintin books ever since I was a child. Tintin is basically meant for children but a number of adults like Tintin as well. Some episodes of the Tintin cartoon have been available on video but I wish all the entire series was available on DVD.For those who aren't familiar with Tintin, the main characters in the Tintin saga isn't just Tintin the intrepid reporter and adventurer and his clever little dog Snowy. Tintin has friends who are often with him on his adventures. Theyinclude Captain Haddock the grumpy sailor, Professor Cusburt Calculous agenius scientist but at the same time a rather stupid person, and Thompson and Thomson the clumsy detective twins. Captain Haddock is a rather bad tempered seaman, most likely because hedrinks too much whiskey. He often uses exclamations like ""BlisteringBarnacles!"" or ""Thundering Typhoons!"" or if he was really outraged or amazedhe would say ""Billions of blistering blue barnacles!"" or ""Ten thousandthundering typhoons!"" Professor Calculous is an amazing inventor. He's invented some amazingthings for example a ""shark-proof submarine"", a drug which makes alcoholicdrinks taste disgusting to cure alcoholic addicted people and a rocket ship to travel to the moon. But he's also rather stupid because he's deaf and alwaysmiss hears what people say. He also ignores non-verbal communication andpretends that he doesn't understand how angry Captain Haddock is which really drives him mad. Thompson and Thomson or ""the Thompson's"" as they're usually called are bothrather stupid detectives and often have clumsy accidents. One of theThompson's is often saying ""to be precise"" correcting the other Thompson andsince they're identical twins and always wear the same clothing you've no idea which Thompson it is. They think they're the worlds best detectives but Tintin always proves to be a much better detective then they'll ever be. So the the Tintin saga is more than just great adventure and detective stories for children but also a combination of rather humorous characters which will delight audiences of all ages."
tt0179552,"This kind of fun and knowledge, I don't often see in these days tv show."
tt0179552,"First, this is basically done in classic Saturday morning cartoon style. After all, that was its budget and target. It's a mistake to expect it to be a Disney movie. Next, it's better than most animations in its class... especially since it benefits from keeping all the plots and comedic details of the original books. The 19th century adolescent delighted to the tales by Mark Twain and those of us adolescents of the middle 20th century got Tintin and related to the adventures in the books. I only recently discovered that this series existed on Netflix and I'm happily reminiscing some of the stories I knew and freshly enjoying some of the stories I missed.Note: I own several of the books (including a couple in Esperanto) and I felt the animation was quite faithful to the original art. I'm not quite sure why others are saying it's not.At the time of this writing, the series has an 8.5 rating on IMDb with over 4000 votes. If it were a movie, it easily would be in the IMDb top 250. If you're not yet a fan, have a watch of the TV series, recent movie, or any of the books. You'll soon be hooked."
tt0179552,"I bought this series when I was on in Singapore. I bought this Complete Season 1,2,3 in DVD Format and cost me around US$ 80 including the TAX from Indonesian Gonverment . When I watched this series for the first time whoa Its a really nice movie. Thats on the local Indonesian TV and it was dubbed in Indonesian so I wasn't enjoy the movie. I completed watched this movie in 2002. Because Now I was 17. And I Got some idea why the director of the films not make this as an movie. Example ""The Adventure of Tintin :The Movie:. Just like Final Fantasy series that can turn into a movie. I really wanted see Tintin become a movie (wether it animation or real people playing).I hope so(Rating) Music:A Story: A+ Character: A Story Line : A+ Character Design : A+OVERALL TOTAL: A Comment: Must WATCHED movie/series"
tt0179552,"Compared to the Belvision series of the 60's, this series is the most faithful adaptation to Herge's timeless comics. Not only are the stories very faithful to the books, but they are also animated in Herge's characteristic 'ligne claire' style. The show's musical score and theme song are great (and often catchy - I still find myself humming them). The voice actors in both French and English versions are very well chosen (even though Tintin sounds too Canadian at times in the English dubbing).A couple of criticisms though, as a die hard fan of the books and of Herge's masterpieces. Many of the adult themes Herge tackled in his stories are altered - eg. the conversation between Tintin and Chang on stereotypes in the Blue Lotus was removed (in fact several themes in that book are missing in the episode), Captain Haddock's drinking problems are toned down. My other criticism is that the 'Tintin and the Picaros' episode was the least faithful to its' book, differing in the era in which the story was set, and neglecting Tintin's own character development (physical and internal).All in all, this series is definitely worth watching and buying. It's fun, and for a Tintin lover it's heaven. It's also a great introduction to perhaps the greatest comic creation of the 20th century."
tt0179552,"This series greatly exemplifies the greatness of the Tintin comic books. I have always loved the Tintin comic books and this show treats the stories well. From the animation to the personalities of the characters, the show is true to the comics. I do agree that Herge would've been proud of this series."
tt0179552,"This fantastic cartoon series, which is not only children's animation, follows the journalist Tintin in many countries of the world. The accents of the voices are also very beautiful. People speak English, but you can hear which country they are from."
tt0179552,"A bit of a boring young man, but quite a good cartoon based in the second world war. Tintin is a reporter looking for stories and always thinking of his friends. His friends are the very good Captain Haddock, Professor Calculus (who just loves his umbrella), and twin Detectives Thompson and Thomson. Tintin has many interesting and dangerous adventures with his cute dog Snowy. These include episodes with tanks, speeding trains, boats, rock climbing and many more. But it's Captain Haddock that stole the show for me. With his good voice, sometimes selfish, helpful to Tintin, and a lot of ways to make you laugh. It was number 77 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Good!"
tt0179552,"The global adventures of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his faithful dog Snowy. Often assisting him in his endeavours are his friends Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus. Bumbling detectives Thompson and Thomson do their best to help.A wonderfully entertaining TV series. Very faithfully to the original comics written by Hergé. I loved the comics as a kid and, while it has been a while since I read the comics, the adaptations here seem very unadulterated, like exact moving picture replicas of the comics. The artwork is pretty much exactly like the Hergé's originals.While it is meant for kids, the stories can easily be enjoyed by adults too. There's great creativity on display plus some wonderful light-hearted moments too."
tt0179552,"This animated TV is the adaptation of the famous Hergé's comic books. Generally, it makes a good adaptation. Some episodes do better than others, but the adaptation is reasonable. Even so, the books are clearly better and more complete. In the animated TV series, they usually miss lots of parts that should be included.I own some of these comic books. I used to watch this TV series as much as I used to read the books I have back then, but I always liked the books better. Anyway, about the TV series, I used to watch it both spoken in french and dubbed in Italian (on Rai Uno, in the case of the Italian dubbed version). Of course that I prefer the french version for the simple fact of being the original version.The stories of Tintin are (the majority of them, apart one or another) quite entertaining, thrilling, great fun, simple and delightful. They are, without a doubt, good adventures with classic humor. It should satisfy most everyone: children, teenagers and adults.The characters are interesting: Tintin is a cool and intelligent chap; his dog Milou is really cute and fluffy; Captain Haddock is grumpy, sarcastic and humorous; Professor Tournesol is the eternal distracted who doesn't listen and understand a word of what the others are saying and, as such, always understands everything very badly. There are also the two police detective twins (Dupond and Dupont), who are absolutely stupid, silly and hilarious.The song that plays during the opening credits and the final credits is great."
tt0179552,"As someone who grew up with Tintin, The Adventures of Tintin was a delightful trip down memory lane. Directed by Steven Spielberg and using state-of-the-art motion-capture animation, the film brings Hergé's iconic characters to life in a way that's both modern and respectful of the original material. The animation is stunning, with attention to detail that makes every scene visually captivating.The film is packed with action and adventure, staying true to the spirit of the original comics. Jamie Bell does a great job voicing Tintin, and Andy Serkis is fantastic as the boisterous Captain Haddock. The plot, which blends elements from several of the comics, is engaging and fast-paced, making it an entertaining watch from start to finish.For fans of the original Tintin stories, this film offers a fresh yet faithful adaptation that captures the essence of what made the comics so beloved. It's a movie that can be enjoyed by both longtime fans and newcomers alike. I give it an 8/10 for its entertaining storyline, impressive animation, and the nostalgic joy it brought to me as a lifelong Tintin fan."
tt0948103,"This show is so very stoic and awesome. The way it plays out reminds of some of the Ancient Greek epics like the Odyssey. The characters are expertly designed as well as the action and visuals. If you're looking to get into anime I recommend you start with this one, it's really a modern classic."
tt0948103,"Personally, I'm not a massive fan of anime, but I can get down with it. This is the first show I've watched all the way through, based on the recommendation of a few anime fanatics, and it was incredible.Generally, the show defies realism by a long shot and is fairly lighthearted, although it expresses very abstract and interesting concepts, and also tense subjects we can all relate to. The first 10 episodes will probably make you think the whole show is going to be about fighting machines battling on a barren landscape, but everything changes dramatically halfway through. The last few episodes nearly had me crying in pure awe. Honestly, this anime is so well done, words cannot really describe it.The show illustrates one primary message: willpower and love are much greater than you can imagine. If you're a bit unsure in the beginning, hold on until halfway through. I promise it gets intense."
tt0948103,"Gurren Lagann is action-packed, funny and colourful to the viewers. It's an absolute feast for the eyes and every hard-boiled otaku should watch this show. It's got robots, busty yet rough-and-tough babes, and ultra-masculine protagonists who inhabit these shonen-esque stories and can be role models to boys that have low self-esteem and look upon these larger-than-life characters as inspirations. Simon and Kamina are great leads for the show; and their big-brother/little-brother dynamic is nearly comparable to FullMetal Alchemist. Gurren is a romp that doesn't really break any new ground; but the thing is its memorably creative take on the mecha genre helps Lagann identify itself as a unique show that knows all it wants to do is have fun and not be taken too seriously.The Japanese hardly ever cease to amaze animation lovers the world over; and this lover here approves of this cult-classic show big time! Wonderful stuff!"
tt0948103,"After a long time of evaluating I think I've finally admitted to myself, this has become my favorite anime (sorry, Berserk).On the surface it's a ""more power"" anime with giant robots, over-the-top action and ridiculous characters. However, the show knows this and plays into it while basically saying to itself, ""I'm going to be the best more power anime with giant robots, over-the-top action and ridiculous characters that anyone has ever seen, and make it so epic that no other giant robot show can compete"". And for me, it basically is.If I could only use two words to describe Gurren Lagann, it would be ""pure energy"". As far as entertainment value is concerned, I don't believe I've felt more entertained by any other anime. Not a single episode was boring filler (well half an episode, which is common in most anime), and along with the theme of the show, each episode is progressively bigger and better than the last. They could have easily made this a 2 season show by breaking it after a certain point, but instead kept it compact and fast-paced.I think what makes the show special is that it never takes itself too seriously (evident by artwork and animation), but ultimately is quite serious in its message, and very thought provoking by the end. Most philosophical anime tend to bog the viewer down in loads of symbolic jargon, and in the end, often end up confusing or boring the audience. Gurren Lagann has all that symbolism that loves to pop up in anime, but basically stays in the background and plays a secondary role. If you wanted to completely ignore the philosophical undertones in the show you could do it, and it would still be very entertaining.The story is pretty straight forward, but if you're wanting to dig deeper, I think the spiral concept used throughout the show is the most unique theme that has been done in an anime. The music is memorable and used very well throughout, with the Libera Me From Hell track from the final three episodes still occasionally being chanted by me, years after hearing it the first time. The ending is feel-good and appropriate to the series.I know this review will probably be seen by only a few of the already converted, but to those who are on the bubble, give the show a shot and there is a good chance it might just become your favorite."
tt0948103,"People usually think of Gainax for Evangelion, and its obvious because Evangelion got all the people of my generation into anime (even if they don't want to admit it...) It was a freakin crazy i-don't-understand-nothing kind of anime series i've never seen before... but nowadays, now that we've seen more and learn more, its not thaaat great, except for the fact that everything we saw after Evangelion was heavily influenced by it, even western stuff.Why do i talk about EVA?, well after all (except for the giant robot part) its nothing nothing at all like Gurren Lagann, its not serious, its not heavy, doesn't keep any information from you, and the main concept of the series (you know, like getting better day by day in Dragon Ball, the search for your own ideals in Samurai x, or the blues in Cowboy Bebop) its completely the opposite. While the main idea in EVA is quite dark and depressive and tries to reach the heart of people through emphathizing with the main character weaknesses, the spiral concept of Gurren Lagann is a call to heroism and faith.So why do I want to compare this two?, first of all the style Gainax made for EVA is clearly present in Gurren Lagann like in most of their series... And second, because for me this two made the same thing in their current time periods, they reminded us why giant robot are so cool!!! Yeah, Evangelion is clearly built for the nineties's standards, being secretive and revolutionary in its way of telling the story, its what we wanted in those days, an anime series that we could call a masterpiece in front of people that didn't watched anime at all... but today we don't care anymore, and Gainax know exactly what we want, super attacks, great fights, great fun, a good story without too much unnecessary story weight, and the best relation between all those parts, if you don't know what i mean go check Gurren Lagann out. It didn't get me addicted like Death Note, Code Geass, claymore or the first Fullmetal alchemist, but later i started to realize i love each one of the episodes of Gurren more, i don't really want to repeat all those series but its been two years and i still watch a Lagann episode or the movie now and then.I love Gurren Lagann, and yeah it has issues, i got bored in one episode (Yoko's episode), but damn its good, even though the second half gets really transformed and sometimes gets you confused you will finally make one big universe in your head for this series... also has the best first episode because it puts in line the main concept trough the chapters of the story getting you all the way to the greatest oh-my-god final episode in anime history, the best.love it love it love it, highly recommend it!"
tt0948103,"Let me throw this out there.....I don't usually look at reviews before I watch something. With that said, I had NO idea what was in store before I started watching this show.Simply put - this is flat out the most absurdly motivating, surprisingly deep, ridiculously awesome show I've ever seen.Question: Does it matter that at a few points I said to myself ""I'm not really sure I understand what exactly is happening right now""?Answer: NO!This show is so over the top it really doesn't matter if you 100% understand whats goin on at certain points (don't get me wrong the story is SUPER good and well thought out). That's not the point. The point is that whatever you believe to be within your grasp....go for it!Just watch this and enjoy it for what it is....EPIC!"
tt0948103,"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Quite a mouthful. Anyway, I won't go on and on here, but I feel compelled to say something about this show because with its perfect blend of comedy, drama, action, and romance, (with no aspect of either feeling forced just for the sake of having it), it is quite simply one of the best animes ever made. Ask a few anime fans to list some of their favorite shows and you'll start to hear quite a few of the greats being repeated. This show easily stands shoulder to shoulder with any and all of them.To give a little idea of the overall feel of this show for the anime fans out there. Let's say you hold, ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", in one hand and, ""FLCL"", in the other. Now put your hands together and you've got Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.Epic is probably the single best word to describe this show; epic in both scope and scale. From the technical aspects of the truly incredible, fluid and stylish animation; to the story with it's take on humanity, evolution and the potential finish lines to which we're sprinting; to the battles, ranging from underground guerrilla warfare in the early stages and ultimately culminating in a climactic finale of truly galactic proportions. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say it involves literally tossing whole planets like baseballs and even flinging entire galaxies like so many shuriken. Epic.Nothing is perfect though, it does stumble a bit in the audio department. However, it only falls short in comparison to the rest of itself. That is to say, while the rest of the show is, ""excellent"", some of the audio aspects are only, ""very good"". The character designs are also nothing special, but that is easily countered by the spectacular animation and the personalities of the characters themselves.It's probably not for everyone. Some may be put off by the artistic styling such as the unconventional and often bizarre angles and techniques as well as the hyperkinetic feel of the animation. I, for one, couldn't be more thrilled with all of it. I've seen a lot of anime and quite frankly most of it is mediocre at best. After wading through so many anime lately with virtually interchangeable story lines, art and characters, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is like a breath of fresh air.Sorry, I guess I did kind of go on and on after all. Anyway...9.5 out of 10, but since IMDb doesn't allow the .5, I'll have to round it up and give my first ever 10."
tt0948103,"I'd like to make a few things clear before I say what i'm about to say about this anime. And that's: ""I didn't want to like it."" I'm serious, when I saw all the hype surrounding it and claims of ""THE best anime"", I felt antagonistic of the whole idea. I never believed it, I mean THE best? There's no way... But then I watched it...Now again, another thing, I don't usually cry. Like, at all. Not a bit. Nor do I scream in excitement, which is why I didn't very much like watching Football with my uncles growing up. But man does Gurren Lagann rip me out of that state of mind. Never before have I seen such a perfect blend, just the right amount of episodes, just the right amount of characters, just the right amount of plot progression, and topped off with a PERFECT amount of action and romance to give me an experience I wouldn't believe. Bawling at some parts and jumping up and chanting ""FIGHT THE POWER!!"" at others, this is definitely the anime to watch, and absolutely the best anime ever. With an ending so satisfying and bittersweet giving you the proper closure you needed for letting go of such a perfect experience. If you haven't watched it do so now. It's Dub is just as good as the original, a rare case indeed, so get out there and become part of the Dai-Gurren Brigade!!"
tt0948103,"If you want a series that can bring entire classes of people together. If you want a show that can make parents, kids, teens, and even my 60 year old uncle watch, then watch this show. TTGL(Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann) is a perfect mix of the elements that make anime the great product that the have become. When most people say cartoons are for kids tie them to a chair and make them watch TTGL. It's comedy has the high and low brow elements that you miss from Hollywood movies. It's action-sequences beat every single anime and action movie I have seen other than Gundam Wing and The Matrix. And the dramatic themes of love, coming of age, depression, grief, forgiveness, friendship, revolution, combine with this underdog as dominator feeling that out does anything you have seen before. You will finish this series and start quoting it after the very first episode. I defy you to not quote Kamina when he says Don't believe in the you that believes in me, or the me that believes in you. Believe in you, the you that believes in yourself. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is truly epic. And to quote the shows fans, completely chock full of GAR!"
tt0948103,"Gurren Lagann follows the story of a young man named Simon who lives in an underground village in a seemingly post-apocalyptic future, where humans beings are forced to live below the surface to avoid the wrath of the evil Beastmen, and their King, Lord Genome. Simon and his friends must venture to the surface and destroy the Beastmen, reclaiming the Earth in the name of humanity.The series is very intensely action oriented and all of the fight scenes are masterfully crafted and are very entertaining to watch. The animation in generally is beautiful, with the exception of one episode which was apparently directed by a different director.The characters in the series are predictable, but lovable at the same time. However, Gainax certainly didn't take modesty into consideration when they designed Yoko, the female lead. Her half naked body, while fun to look at, takes center stage in almost every scene that she's in. However, despite using her to sell out to sex appeal, Yoko is revealed to be subjected to loss, sadness and pain throughout the series just like the other characters, and personally, is my favorite character in the show.The problem I find with Gurren Lagann, is that half way through, it exits the land of bad ass giant robots fighting giant robots, and enters the land of obscenely huge robots doing battle with entire universes and alternate realities and all manner of ridiculous science fiction. I feel like Gainax spent almost no time brainstorming the plausibility and design of the antagonists from the second half of the series as we are mostly treated to our heroes fighting giant stone faces and hands and other stupid shapes, which is also found in their other notable series: Evangelion.Overall, Gurren Lagann is fun to watch until the point where the story enters the realm of absolute absurdity."
tt0948103,"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is the pinnacle of anime insanity. No Dragon Ball or super robot show can come close to the ridiculousness of TTGL. It breaks the record, then reaches a million miles further. Its so over-the-top that any anime that would try to beat it would only chase its coat tails.But what really makes TTGL one of the best is its controlled juuuuust enough for you to take it seriously. It isn't amped to 11 every episode. Its well-paced, and gradually progresses. The characters are very likable, the animation is solid, and the music is great! The best moments of the show are perfectly executed, working on so many levels. Its more than gigantic explosions and drills.You'd have to be a sworn enemy of fun to hate TTGL. Its awesome, but emotional too. Its easily one of my favorites.Final note - The movies are mostly rehashes of the TV series. But the final battle...well, let's just say it managed to top itself, somehow. See the second movie's ending for the stunning conclusion to the series, skip the rest."
tt0948103,"I only have watched 15 of the 27 Episodes of this anime, which concludes the first mayor ark of the story, because I really wanted to give this show a shot. And I must say, the animation is quite stunning, but the story isn't too good, pretty basic in fact, but so over the top like only anime can. Most of the characters are pretty annoying, and aren't really that likable, because they scream almost all the time, which in itself is pretty aggravating . At least the dub isn't too bad. A few characters you grew to love. And many of the gunman designs are very creative and fun to watch. Still, I can't really get warm with it, it's just isn't my taste, which is why I only give it 6/10 I see that they put a lot of effort in the animation and style and did the best they could with the source material. I wish other anime would get that good animation as well."
tt0948103,"I enjoy anime and have watched tons of them, so when I was looking for a new one to start, I came across Gurren Lagann. It was ranked high and seemed to have a cult following, so I decided to give it a shot. Even though I was not enjoying the initial episodes I continued watching as lots of reviews said you need to give it a few episodes to get into the groove. Well, I watched it till the end and got to say I didn't enjoy it one bit. The story is basic, the dialogues are silly, the characters annoying, everything which happens is over the top. According to me, the target audiences are kids. I simply don't comprehend the rave reviews the show got."
tt0948103,"I'm speechless.. this show has left an enormous hole in my heart, i feel like a pet or family member has just died after finishing the last episode just knowing that its over. This is possibly the deepest anime or show I've ever seen, it speaks on so many levels. I didn't think a show could have so much substance. I put off watching this show for about 2 years because i knew it was a ""mecha"" genre and i can't stand that type with very few exceptions, i believe that to be one of my biggest regrets. This show is a master piece in every aspect, there's not much more i can say that can sum it up better than that. The story is absolutely amazing from episode one to the very end, the animation style is breath taking and my favorite from any style. The music is crazy, its perfect in every way. The opening and ending themes are catchy and you can just sit there and listen to it endlessly and the voice acting is spectacular. And for any people that are like me and are thinking of passing it up because ""mecha"" this is one title you absolutely need to take a leap of faith with and i am 100% positive you'll fall in love with this show, it doesn't even feel like your typical mecha show even slightly. There's not much more i can add without getting into the show itself, i'll just add this is what every anime or show in general should stride to be.5/5 Why? It IS perfection (imo). The story is just..perfect. The artwork and animation is just so good i want to throw up from excitement, and the music matches it all perfectly. I literally can't think of a single thing i disliked about this show. Do NOT pass this up, it'll become one of your favorites."
tt0948103,"You know that feeling of total shock and awe that you get after finishing a really good show or movie? Where you just sit there staring at the screen, unable to process the sheer epicness of what you just saw? Imagine that feeling, but ten times stronger, and you might get a taste of what I felt while watching Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Every time I finish that final episode, I get this euphoric feeling that lasts for several hours on end, often keeping me up the entire night on pure adrenaline. There isn't a single day that goes by where I don't have flashbacks to certain scenes from the show and start getting the chills all over again. Yes, it's that good.One of the most common misconceptions of Gurren Lagann I hear is that it's a simple, mindless show that's all about over the top fight scenes and cheesy inspirational speeches. And while the show has plenty of those, it has way more than just adrenaline rushes to offer. The story is very well written, following several intertwined character arcs and thematic ideas that all spiral around a very deep and thought provoking central message. The attention to detail is ridiculous, with extended metaphors that can be applied to almost every aspect of the show. On top of that, there are several plot twists and surprises to keep the viewer engaged. The only issue I might have with the story is with a couple episodes near the beginning, which I feel are weaker than the rest of the show, but the last few episodes more than make up for it with my favorite ending of all time.The major characters of this show are brilliantly written. Kamina's bold relentless attitude has its own charm, and Simon ""the Digger"" has one of the best character arcs I've seen in any form of media. Other characters like Yoko, Viral, Rossiu, and Lordgenome all have their own traits and well written arcs throughout the series. While their world is very different from ours, the characters feel very real and relatable through their growth. And of course, the villains are also great, with justified and believable motivations that serve as a near perfect contrast to our protagonists.The visuals are animation are outstanding in this show, especially when considering that it was made in 2007. The fights are beautifully choreographed and visually appealing with vivid color palettes. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen in anime. And there's plenty of visual symbolism that adds meaning to the story and characters. The art is especially good in the final few episodes, which the creators saved 40% of their budget for. And it shows; those final episodes are some of the most beautiful episodes I've ever seen. That final fight, oh my god.The show is just as amazing in the audio department. The voice acting is powerful for both the sub and dub versions. In fact, it has one of the best dubs I've heard, right alongside Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. But where the sound truly stands out is in the music. There's a large variety of soundtracks that perfectly capture every scene, whether they're happy, sad, spine-chilling, or pure hype moments. One track in particular, titled ""Libera Me From Hell"", is the most unique and symbolic soundtrack I've ever heard. It plays during some of the best scenes in the entire show, and it makes those scenes that much better.Yeah, as you can probably tell by now, I love this show. It's my favorite piece of fiction across all types of media and storytelling, and I've had more fun watching it than anything else. Hell, those last few episodes are probably in the top ten best experiences of my life. The show's messages have genuinely made a positive impact on my life and how I view the world. And while I don't expect everyone to enjoy it as much as I do, I think anyone would be doing themselves a huge favor by watching it. So what are you waiting for? Open a new window and experience one of the most epic shows anime has to offer."
tt0948103,"No show this short has ever given me the amount of chills as this. The only comparable shows would be the giants: One Piece, Naruto, Haikyuu.This show is a masterpiece."
tt0948103,"Gurren Laggan is a brilliant work done. It is funny and at the same time serious. However, its strength lies in the characters both supporting and major as well as their depth. In my opinion, the anime develops in three phases; the first phase is from episode 1-8. The second phase picks off from episode 9-16 and the final phase is from 17 to the last episode. The first phase does not take the show seriously. Watching the first 7 episodes, the show might appear like a comedy series. Don't take this phase seriously and write the anime off; it is actually building up and setting a pace for a great story arc that follows. On episode 8, the show matures taking a brilliant approach we rarely see in anime. The second phase was on fire. The show now envelopes into a serious anime while maintaining the comedy. It creates simple battles between our heroes and opponents but the fight scenes are so brilliant it will have you cheering on your seat. The third phase was a Revolution. The anime becomes so good, transforming the entire story from a simple ""save the world"" plot into a complex, politically sophisticated ""save the world"" plot. It is here that the characters shine the most. The development of the characters and their depth is nearly unmatched by other anime. The construction of the main and side characters was originally simple but it transitioned them into characters who were actually ""human"" in the third phase. When people speak about Gurren Laggan, fans love to point out at the brilliant action scenes which are well done. However, people forget the political side as well which I dare say is on par with Attack on Titan, Galactic heroes, Code Geass etc. Gurren Laggan is truly among the most amazing mecha animes ever made because it takes a very unique approach to that ""humans vs monsters"" plot we've seen all the time. It serves as a role model for animes with well developed large characters."
tt0948103,"Long ago, in a distant land, I the Transformers ripoff of darkness, unleashed an unspeakable anime. But the foolish Spiral warrior wielding a magic drill stepped forth to oppose me. *slashing sounds* Before the final hole was drilled, I tricked them into a different way of thinking where my evil is law. Now the fool seeks to travel 27 years in the future and I guess he really can't undo the past that is Lord Genome!But seriously, it's a great show with depth, creativity, emotion, and great animation, music and atmosphere. It is one of my favorite shows of all time. Everything is handled perfectly and you can tell that everyone that worked on it cared a lot about the show."
tt0948103,"Gurren Lagann is ridiculously stupid and illogical and it knows it, which of course works it its favor. It knows that it isn't a deep character study with a rich, deep fulfilling plot, so it fills most of the episodes to the brim with beautifully animated kick-ass action scenes, though the show has its share of faults. It takes a while to really pick up, at least it did for me. It was only up until maybe halfway through that it started to become awesome. Up until that point the show wasn't terrible. It just didn't really capture my attention. The show did come to a bit of a halt for maybe 3 episodes, when Rossiu decides to turn into a dick, but it's brief and didn't hurt the show overall. Other than that, I had no problems with this show. It's incredibly stupid, but man if it isn't some incredible popcorn entertainment. ( I forgot to mention: the last episode may contain the most epic fight scene of all time. Brace yourself.)"
tt0948103,The first half was crazy but then the second half happens. I was actually at the doge of my seat physically watching this. The animation is amazing for the year it came out and it has aged really well. Go watch.
tt0948103,"I just watched it for the 3rd time. I cried, I laughed . But more than anything I really enjoyed it another time and that never happened before.
Watching animes since 40 years I've seen many cool stuff but this one is over the top. Animation, character development , story, crazyness and feelings. Dudes in Robots having strong and humans feelings, this is what TTGL is about.Hm. I don't even know how to describe this. Go and see it, best anime . Ever."
tt0948103,Nothing can compare with this one. I am glad people around the world now have a chance to see it on Netflix.
tt1695360,"Avatar: The Legend of Korra is by no means as good as the phenomenal The Last Airbender, but you can tell that the team behind it had a lot on their minds regarding the Avatar universe. And that may be its biggest flaw.What I mean is that all the elements that made its predecessor so great is still in here, but at the same time it's trying to be its own thing which ends up making it feel all over the place with world-building, character arcs and romance plots either scattered across all four seasons or hastily concluded without feeling fully developed.The first season is in my opinion the most successful at blending it all together with Korra coming to Republic City to discover a colorful crowd amongst the many inhabitants and what they do in their leisure time and the way the higher-ups run the city. And a dark side of a seemingly peaceful place for all which include the chilling Amon on top of a rebellion.So, while there is a promising premise for season two about the spiritual side of being the Avatar which leads to an epic conclusion and an interesting result, it is here it all starts to jumble together with various subplots which makes it feel disjointed and rushed.In the character department we have Korra as the main character, a young woman with a temper who sadly often comes off as arrogant and bratty. She learn throughout the series, but is also a victim of the messy writing. The characters are a mixed bag overall.Animation is still top-notch, and when the series keeps its focus, we get an expanding look into the world of the Avatar and the people attached to her/him."
tt1695360,"To those uncertain about The Legend of Korra: watch it. It is every bit as good as the original Avatar series was. Set in a more modern world, the new avatar is faced with struggles of a different kind, struggles that relate more to our modern world. Technology is booming, crime is rising, and a revolution is awakening. This is much more real than the last series was.The characters are built incredibly realistic, too. Korra is a revolutionary heroine: she is realistic, imperfect, hasty, rebellious... all the things that a teenager girl really would be. Faced with difficult decisions, she doesn't always choose the right ones, yet she always learns from them. The other characters also show these strenghts and weaknesses along with equal depth to the characters of The Last Airbender.While different, troubled, and darker than the original, everyone should give The Legend of Korra a chance. It has many wonders to be seen as of yet and her story is only just beginning."
tt1695360,Zaheer had so much potential and i think he should had more screen time. He could have been a much more terrefying villain. I do recommend to people who like avatar in general to watch this. It does pay off. The second and the last seasons are my least favorite. The first and the third were my favorite. A must watch for avatar lovers.
tt1695360,"Going into this series after having finally watched Avatar: The Last Airbender, I was expecting it to be a classic sequel-case with excessive fan-service and more one-dimensional plot lines and characters.I'm very glad to say this this really isn't the case. The series does not use The Last Airbender as a crutch - it evolves past it, exploring characters completely different to those seen in the original series, all the while expanding the Avatar universe - everything that a sequel should aim for. This show is wonderful journey not dissimilar to ATLA, but it also stands on its own, and is no less enjoyable.I cannot recommend this series enough to anybody who enjoyed The Last Airbender."
tt1695360,"The Legend Of Korra is a very worthy successor of the first series. It's a totally different environment, and the circumstances are also entirely different, but you can see that the makers of the series have put a lot of work and effort in the second series. The only downside I can think of is that, because the series will only concludes two seasons, is that, in my opinion, everything's a bit rushed. It's like they want to fit a lot of content into the 2 season time-frame. On the other hand, the series is brilliantly detailed, just like its predecessor, and has it's typical quirky humour. And the tension that they're building up throughout the show is an excellent way of keeping people tethered to their screens and to the series!"
tt1695360,"Legend of Korra appeals to be way more mature than its prequel: The Last Airbender. Whilst that gives an edge to Korra, it also removes that childish and innocent humor enveloped in rather serious conflict. Still, do not be fooled - Legend of Korra is an impressive animation work; it goes flawlessly in graphic and motion design, it doesn't lack a humor nor a good, intriguing story. Korra is basically everything Aang wasn't: She's stubborn, hasty, inpatient and not as shy as Aang. I think they made quite a good move here since we already have three season with over twenty episodes to watch a mindful, calm and shy Aang. The gathering, or gang if you wish, are also kind a different. There's that innocent, teen ""Love squared"" as I like to call it which is more amusing than serious, though. Then there's again one ""wisdomous"" guy with only patience and non-conflict solution on his mind. There are also many others; lots and lots of different characters that you will surely enjoy in. It's actually still early to judge the show because it unravels itself episode by episode. As the more episodes are aired, the more you realize about the story of Republic City and all its mysteries. To short the long talk, Legend of Korra is most likely more mature than the Last Airbender (which actually brings another question: if Tenzin is the Aang's only child (or so I understood), then there's only four (upcoming fifth) remaining Airbenders - We'll see), with not so much a childish humor (which is still there, don't worry) and a story which untangles really slowly and forces you to watch the show from episode to episode. If you loved the prequel, you'll love its sequel."
tt1695360,"I enjoyed the previous series, ""The Last Airbender,"" and I had been checking every month or so to see if the new ""Legend of Korra"" had been released yet. Yesterday I realized that five or six episodes had been released so I watched them all while typing up some notes for school. I have to say, the first couple of episodes I was pretty worried. Many of the characters seemed very harsh and unlikable. Yet, as I got to know them better, I really started to like them and enjoy the show. ""Legend of Korra"" is lacking the hilarity which made ""Airbender"" so fun to watch, yet it is replaced with more menace, intrigue, and (I want to use the adjective ""page-turning"") excitement. The bits of humor that are present are perfect and I think they have captured a good balance. I'm really hooked. 9/10. The one missing star is in case the show takes a turn for the worse."
tt1695360,"The Legend of Korra starts pretty high paced and the new avatar is found fast, in contradiction to the previous series (where they take more time with the intro). This means that the adventure also start fast. Also, note that you should have seen the ""Avatar, the Last Airbender"" before you watch this one.They have put some new concepts (for this series), like: after 70 years there is new some new technology, more love story, and a lot in the city (where Aang travels a lot over the entire world). I like this, but I have the feeling that there is a little too much, like too much new technology and too much love. I would have found it better that some technology is still being developed or missing (which other technology could be made clumsy in use). But there are also some new cool elements, such as the way of telling what has happened ""previously on avatar"", and a new sports game. The humor is still good (I had a very good laugh somewhere in episode 10), and it's nice to see some of the previous (aged) characters back. I rate this 8/10 because of I really like the concept of newer technology in a fantasy world. But not higher because some elements are a little too much (to my opinion). Anyway, I couldn't stop watching and saw this entire season straight."
tt1695360,"I just finished all 4 seasons and I can not say anything else than that Korra is a pretty average show. By itself not a bad thing, but going into this with the high expectations after having seen the original series. Damn.Let's start with the good thing. The animations. By far the best thing about The Legend of Korra. The scenery, characters and fight scenes all look amazing. You will not get dissapointed by that, coming from The Last Airbender. It might even look a bit more polished than the original.Once you take away the beautiful cover though, and look at the insides. It was a bit of a chore to watch the entire show, I felt myself being disinterested by what was happening on the screen a lot during these 4 seasons. Boring if you will.Unlike The Last Airbender, the characters are not as fun or interesting. That goes for the good guys as well as the villains. A cool antagonist like Zuko or the rest of the Fire crew? Not even close. So while the action scenes looked amazing, I just sort of felt numb for them as the series didn't do its job by making me care what happens.I didn't really care for the 1930's aesthetic of the show either. It just made things goofy in my opinion, and not the good kind.If you're planning on watching Korra, there's a big chance you have watched Avatar already. And if so, it doesn't matter what warning people give you as you will watch Korra regardless just for the chance it even has a glimmer of quality that ATLA has.So here's a consolation hug in advance to help you with your dissapointment after having seen this. I know, it wasn't as good. There there."
tt1695360,It was never going to be as good as the original series and although does deliver some good episodes you cannot help feel wanting with it. It is clear that the production team have attempted to bring more of the characters thoughts and feelings into it whilst also making the storyline more complex. I suppose they had to try something different otherwise it would have been called a rip off of the original. Its a decent series and had a hard act to follow but was lacking for me.
tt1695360,"The Avatar is back and this time she is a teenager who is far from calm and peaceful.Compared to Avatar: The Legend of Aang, this sequel has its own appeal: it's really energetic, featuring mostly city environments, has an older cast than the one in Aang, and just has an overall faster, flashier and more forceful pace than its predecessor. That makes it a lot of fun, and a very exciting show, but at times it also makes it hard for me to warm up to the cast, and hard to just take a moment of contemplation, peace, and relaxation like I would with The Last Airbender.Visually, like ""Aang"", this show is stunning. Beautiful, intricate and unique environments, with lots of fluid and well-crafted motion. Awesome soundtrack with the series' trademark mix of eastern and western music, but ""Korra's"" music is more rocky and jazzy, to match with the show's tempo, than ""Aang's"" smooth and calm scores. The storyline seems to be picking up quite nicely as well, with civil conflict brewing up in Republic City. The show is definitely making its own path and tone, and setting itself apart from ""Aang"".But I still found myself really missing ""Aang's"" serene environments, gentler characters, and the cute, quirky humor. In fact I kind of found it hard to warm up to the characters in ""Korra""....Korra is overall a very cool character, but is too aggressive and forceful. I hope that changes throughout the show, as Avatar always shows the evolution of its characters. Her newfound city friends, as well, are not that likable and their friendship is a little distant -- Aang, Katara and Sokka's friendship was as naturally progressing, fun, and close as they get. I also really miss the silly humor! Who can forget the cabbage seller from ""Aang"", and Sokka's silliness. With ""Korra""'s older cast and a very serious conflict and villain already introduced and confronted, I really want more humor to balance the show out.I think the show needs to calm down a bit, take a breath, and let its characters meaningfully interact a little more before ramping up the action to the 1000th degree. Still, a flaw due to excess is better than a flaw due to lack. The Legend of Korra is an excellent and well-crafted show, and I look forward to seeing it form into a series worthy of its predecessor."
tt1695360,"Rating 8.0Favorite Episode: Venom of the Red LotusNot as nearly good as ATLA, but still a great watch."
tt1695360,"It's very rare to come by a good, western-animated show that has so much depth, emotions and darker/more complicated themes to it. The avatar series, and the legend of korra specifically, are absolutely top notch with combining deeper themes and animation. The show's artstyle is stunning with very well thought out battle scenes. The story follows Korra's journey of realizing herself as the avatar, post- 100 year war and Aang's time, where she has to deal with incredibly well written villains, the declining image of the avatar in a more modern world and mental struggles all at once! It's never easy being the avatar, and the writers sure didn't go easy on her and her team.The main reason why it's so fun watching this show is because it EXPANDS on an already great universe, created in the first series, with Aang. I can never get enough of it! If you consider yourself an avatar fan- GO WATCH IT RIGHT NOW. I can 100% guarantee you won't regret it and have a great time."
tt1695360,"The Legend of Korra seriously takes some steps into the right direction by throwing in some more or less ""new"" concepts (new as new for Avatar) such as love stories and relationships from the get go and a more ""modern"" world. If you watched the original Avatar (if you didn't go right to it) you may appreciate that, although Korra really has some of Avatar's good old content such as fast-paced element-bender battles, it also feels new and fresh and in no way ""forced"" to be a sequel on it's own. If it really will be as entertaining and as good as the prequel only time can tell but for now (seen 6 episodes so far) the story is more promising than I ever could have imagined it to be. Last but not least I really want to point out the storytelling: If you pay attention you'll notice that the script for this series is much more than just a foolish attempt to catch the fame of ""Avatar"": Many old characters can be ""found"" here, revived as new roles. Great humor and action awaits."
tt1695360,"LOK takes place 70 years after the TLA, with a new Avatar emerging in an ever changing world. Let me start by saying this is not the TLA part 2, while it exists in the same world, this is a brand new story filled with new characters. The show is very good in that sense, as while keeps the charm and environment of the TLA, it makes sure to change the world so we don't have a complete rehash of the same story. While the characters are good, especially the development of Korea herself as it becomes a true joy watching her change into a respectable Avatar. With the story Itself (with the exception of 1 or 2 things) is excellent and truly shows a new take on the Avatar. This is a series that you must watch if you liked TLA, and admittedly season 1 isn't where the series shines the brightest, but the coming seasons show why this is worthy of the Avatar name."
tt1695360,"Korra's struggle is hard to overcome.Because her struggle isn't just with villains,also her struggle is with her own mentality and sense.I think Aang's story is funnier.But Korra's story is more melancholic and deeper.Also Korra is one of us.The villains have a more purpose and reasons to being a bad .in The Legend of Korra, The ideologies of the villains are very meaningful and trueI liked so much, soundtracks, emotional moments and off course Korra.
It was just perfect except for a few plot holes"
tt1695360,"Yes, The Legend of Korra is not as great as ATLA because this show is something different than ATLA. The Story , Characters, Action sequences, political elements were very good and enjoyable. Some Plot twists were Predictable , some were unexpected.
The Seasons 1-3 were very enjoyable but the final season was kind of a mixed bag.
Overall the show is WORTH WATCHING!"
tt1695360,"Korra's story is very different from Aang's, and it has some major problems going on but overall it's a great story and any fan of the original should watch it. The flaws seem to have primarily emerged due to the creators not having a guarantee for successive seasons of the show. Each season is essentially its own self-contained story with little overarching plot from season to season. It's just not quite as compelling to watch as the original and if you go into with an attitude of comparing it to its predecessor, you'll likely be disappointed.On its own merits, The Legend of Korra offers interesting plot lines, decent-to-great characters, and builds on the fantastic world of the original. Korra undergoes significant growth over the course of the series, having experienced great hardships. The tone of this series is more mature and it addresses serious issues masterfully. As did The Last Airbender, the show broadens your soul to appreciate some of the important personal growth we should all have. However, the fact that the show delves into such topics (while certainly beneficial to an adult), is a bit heavy for a child.Is it as good as the original? Certainly not. But holding anything to such an impossible standard isn't fair, even if it is a sequel to it. I watched it with an attitude of comparing it to the original a few years ago and was disappointed, the second time through I had different expectations and thoroughly enjoyed it."
tt1695360,"This show really grew on me. Expect more adult topics in this show. It is different from the original Avatar, but it greatly stands on its own. The creators did a great job."
tt1836037,"I actually enjoyed Longmire a lot more than I thought I would. I'm so glad Netflix picked this up after it cancelled. It was originally cancelled after season 3 and then Netflix picked it up. It didn't drop in quality at all either. If anything it got better on Netflix because they had a bigger budget to work with. I never watched it when it originally on but was looking for a new show to watch recently and Longmire was that show. It took an episode or two to get going but after that I was hooked. Once I started watching I couldn't stop, I binged all six seasons in just a couple weeks. The acting and writing is so good that it just pulls you in and you start to actually care about these characters. It's a classic modern western so if you're into that kind of genre then give this show a chance. I promise you won't be disappointed."
tt1836037,I'm so glad that I finally gave Longmire a chance. I've heard nothing but great things about it for years but for some reason I still put off watching it. Once the pandemic started and I had a lot more free time I thought I'd finally give it a chance and I couldn't be happier that I did because I really dig it. It has good plots and well written characters. The shows continues to grow and get better as the seasons go on and it finds what kings of show it wants to be. I originally thought it was just another police procedural like the thousand other ones available but this one is easily one of the better ones. If you haven't watched this series yet do yourself a favor and go watch it!
tt1836037,"I can understand some of the negative reviews. Some of it I agree with. On shows like this, if it is in your wheelhouse, you buy in completely, and I'm there. Some of the supporting characters are over the top, but one thing is for sure, Robert Taylor is amazing. I wish there was someway to get a buzz going on the Internet about a Best Actor nomination for an Emmy.It's a good procedural and plenty of dramatic elements. I'm never bored and it's quite different from previous attempts at Western cop dramas. I'm glad it's not another fish out of water story like Coogan's Bluff or McCloud. Robert Taylor's screen presence is the glue that holds it all together."
tt1836037,"Having been raised in New Mexico, I love seeing a cop show set in the West...... It reminds me of seeing the Sheriff Department's deputies driving out in the desert when I had the opportunity to go target shooting out in the ""boondocks"" with my brothers. These deputies would be out on the job making sure everything was cool; Longmire reminds me of these guys: good people, down to earth, wise in their ways, and knowing how to do their jobs. I love this show; and Robert Taylor, to me, is the Matt Dillon of the 21st century. I didn't realize Mr. Taylor was Australian until I read his bio. This guy passes the test with flying colors! He acts and sounds like he is from the old American West. It doesn't get much better than this."
tt1836037,"We're not in Kansas anymore both literally and figuratively. Literally Longmire takes place in Wyoming. Figuratively it represents yet another persuasive piece of evidence for the view that higher quality product is coming out of TV than the studios these days. Whoda thunk it? Following JUSTIFIED and HATFIELDS/MCCOYS, we have this new entry and it is prime Grade A Entertainment. Arguably a little less showy than JUSTIFIED, it serves up each week a visceral portrait of an old-time lawman in the modern world -- Taylor is brilliant -- along with some intellectual thrills as well. In the first episode, Longmire justifies (pardon the pun) the fact that he was seen ""reading on the job"" by revealing the book he was reading -- and it's Sherlock Holmes. Recommended to keep your skills sharp, he explains. Also a nice blending of testosterone and estrogen, with Katee Sackhoff and Cassaday Freeman there to remind viewers that the Wild West was not merely a bunch of cranky old guys so macho they could jog home from their own vasectomies. Lou Diamond Phillips, a bit older now, is excellent in a supporting role. If all TV was this good, Hollywood would be out of a job..ADDENDUM; I just upgraded my rating from a 9 to a 10 as I finished season 1. This show is a jewel. No wasted dialogue, no wasted camera angles, no wasted cuts. Easily one of the leanest productions in recent memory, and possibly should come with a warning that it is addictive. Sackoff's voice contains so many tones and nuances that I Google'd her, turns out she is not only a superb actress but a tier-1 animation voice too. Wow.FINAL ADDENDUM 2018 -- Goodbye Team Longmire you will be missed -- this show had a ""near death experience"" with its original network and was ""rescued"" by Netflix. (Netflix in 2018 is growing so fast it needs a constant supply of product -- a topic well beyond the scope of this review). This is the point where i would like to tell you that, during the ""Netlix"" episodes, the quality was unchanged -- but I cannot say that because the quality fell significantly as did, I am sure, the budgets available under the new production deal. What used to be a legitimate ""mystery"" show with astonishingly strong background characters morphed into a character show with an actual mystery popping up only occasionally. Which meant that the Netflix episodes were really for diehard fans only. If you are newbie to the series, you cannot go wrong with the first few seasons. They are brilliant. If you are a fan, the last season and the big FINALE are a bit maudlin, but still comfortable. Will miss this show. A lot."
tt1836037,"I really enjoyed the show. It reminded me of a Louis L'Amour novel. I haven't read the books this show is based on, but I plan to soon. I appreciated the pace, and overall feel of it. I felt completely absorbed in the realness of the characters, and really felt like I was in Wyoming. No glitzy computerized special effects, and no unrealistically fast crime scene analysis. I am looking forward to ""getting to know"" the characters. I loved the little town square, the Wranglers, and the scenery is breathtaking. I also enjoyed the music. Very happy the show includes one of my favorite actresses, Katee Sackhoff."
tt1836037,"Watched Longmire four times in the past 24 hours - stood up to my personal test! No wasted dialogue, all conversation is relevant to the story line, no unnecessary ""action,"" great scenery, interesting character development....I think the sheriff may be the Australian actor Robert Taylor - with a terrific American accent. I've seen him in Ballykissangel on PBS and in a couple of UK mystery series but didn't realise he was the same person until I read his credits.As to the portrayal of Native Americans, I have been privileged to have had a few American Indians as good friends over the past decades. As stated by a previous poster, we all come in all types and varieties. I found the depictions to be realistic."
tt1836037,"I have been a fan since the beginning of Longmire. When I heard it had been cancelled I just couldn't believe a show with this class could be dumped. There was never a moment when Longmire was disappointing. The whole cast was always in top form, building with each episode characters with edges that were always clear but bendable, making them interesting and surprising. Scripts that kept you thinking. Then after 3 great seasons cancelled. The news that Netflix had picked up for season 4 made me hope.Well, thank you Netflix. Season 4 is here. I have watched them all, loved them all, they made me sad, made me smile, and most of all they made me hope that there will at least be a season 5.Ps. Watched the final episode today. I was, I admit it, in tears for the happy ending(s) and for the fact that such a great TV show was allowed to come to an actual end. All seasons have been exceptional and I will be recommending this show even in years to come because it will never get out-dated. Thanks to everyone who made this so great."
tt1836037,"Crime, drama, good vs bad, characters and great actors all make for a good story line. There is enough subtle humor to keep it interesting, and the action is fast moving, so that it doesn't get boring. Conflict among the characters make it more real life. There is potential for the development of romance as the storyline unfolds. Some of the characters are recognizable from other major shows, which makes the show even more appealing. The characters display the true western tough-guy, no-nonsense approach to dealing with wild-west crime. The tough-girl on the show makes it even better. I look forward to seeing where the writers will take the various characters in future episodes."
tt1836037,"So I watched the pilot and fell in love with the show for many different reasons; the beautiful countryside, the cleverly written mysteries, the sly Indian friend, the spunky deputy..... But above all, I fell in love with Walt Longmire played brilliantly by Robert Taylor. (Who I was slightly crushed to find out was Australian, not American.) I loved his Character, a strong, silent, funny-in-a-wry-deadpan-kind-of-way, all around good man.Then I found out that there where books, and my heart sank. No way was I not going to read them, but I was afraid that the book Walt Longmire would be different from the show Walt Longmire, who I really liked.I stand by the view that the book is always better that the movie or TV show, because let's face it, things suffer when you transfer to the screen, usually the characters. That is why when a character is done well, the success is all the sweeter.You can sacrifice a lot, in the form of story line, if the characters are acted and written well. (Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings, or Colin Firths Mr.Darcy in Pride and Prejudice) I read the books and found that I had nothing to be afraid of! If at all possible I got more excited about the show because I read the TV Walt in the pages of the book, and the book gave me more depth and back story to this man's character that I now saw played out in the show. That's how good a job Robert Taylor does.Read the books! Watch the show! And enjoy them both for that are just extensions of each other!And that is why I am a fan!"
tt1836037,"I'll admit I only gave this show a chance because it premiered at a time when a lot of shows are on break. I'm glad that I did because this might just turn out to be the next great law show (Justified being the most recent). Have to wait and see how the season turns out.After watching the first episode, you can immediately tell the producers and writers are keen on character development. With the only about half the episode devoted to the first case itself, you'll learn a lot about Sheriff Longmire quickly. That's not to say you won't enjoy it though. This show is VERY watchable. I actually went back and watched it again the next day. A&E hasn't produced a lot of shows I've enjoyed but I'm looking forward to the episode.Set in Wyoming, viewers can expect to see beautiful scenery and the pilot certainly did not disappoint in that sense. Native Americans play a major roll in this show and it seems the hostilities will progress throughout the season. The show focuses on old school methods of law enforcement rather than the recent trend of C.S.I. semen under the fridge kinds that have been dominating in recent years.Give this the show a chance."
tt1836037,"I had not planned to watch this series, but luckily caught the Pilot. The characters are multi faceted, deep and interesting. The scenery is beautiful. It is wonderful to watch a program that doesn't depend on special effects and empty chatter. Granted there have been a couple of scenes I would have left on the editing floor, but overall, great. I love the Wyoming and Indian Reservation setting. Be careful, you might actually learn something. Robert Taylor is well cast as the sheriff. Personally, I would have loved John Corbett as the Sheriff. I love ""Ruby"". Is she an actress or a real sheriff office employee? The actors are that good. Louie Diamond Phillips is always excellent. I'm looking forward to the new season."
tt1836037,"Seasons 1-4 were really great, I blew through them in a week and was totally hooked, but after that the writing went downhill unbelievably fast. Season 5 almost did me in but I stuck with it and I suffered through Season 6 just to see how it finally ended and it was excruciatingly hard. Walt became an utter cliche by the end, as did Vic, to the point that I really couldn't stand either of them by the last episode. Just so unbelievably sad to see a good show ruined by such horrible writing over the last 2 seasons. And the actual ending was so utterly ridiculous and disappointing I just had to write this review to warn people. Take my advice please, watch the first 4 seasons of a great show then STOP! Sure wish I had..."
tt1836037,"Longmire is an interesting character driven show. With some unique situations and breathtaking scenery, this series deserves a long run. Let's give this show time to develop. The relationships between Longmires daughter and the deputy sets the stage for a possible rocky three way feud. Lou Diamond Phillips, as the bar owner part time tracker, does some of the best acting that he has done in years. The supporting cast is believable and the guest roles have been filled with creditable and sometimes quirky characters that give a different sense of style to each episode. AMC has served up several excellent series and this may just be one of the best yet."
tt1836037,"Seasons 1, 2, and 3 were excellent, but Season 4 is outstanding!!!!!!!! The characterizations are right on and the intermingling of the various stories is intriguing but nowhere near confusing as these sorts of things sometimes are. It seems as if Robert Taylor was born to be Walt. Lou Diamond Philips never disappoints. Kate Sackhoff is right there. Good cop, beautiful woman. The rest of the cast members are top notch. The show has all the elements of a great western while being a good modern mystery.I am tempted to binge watch, but I find it good to contemplate each episode for awhile before going on to the next one. This show is a reason to subscribe to Netflix. 11 stars."
tt1836037,"I was a little late to the party to finish the Longmire series, but with a very nasty spring in the Northeast, I finally was able to hunker down and watch the whole thing again from the start over the course of a week or two. I am so glad that I took the time to finally finish it. I noticed some bad reviews about the Season 6 episodes, so I was quite wary when I approached the final season....but wow, I couldn't agree less with those reviews. I thought the Season 6 episodes were just as good, that is if it didn't get actually even better with age!Great show, highly recommended."
tt1836037,"i watch a lot of old westerns and western TV reruns. Longmire reminds me of the Marshal Dillion TV show. Excellent! My favorite episode so far, The Dog Soldier. Am sitting here with Marshall Dillon on at present. He tall, a gentleman and will kick your ass when necessary. They are one and the same. Hope it doesn't go the way of the good TV shows and TV has the intelligence to order more seasons. There's already too much that isn't watchable these days. As a N. American i like the fact that the series shows the difficulities N. American STILL face. With all the stupid reality TV shows this one with is simply reality stands out. And thats a good thing. As my mothers people would say Nuwedi! (Thank you)"
tt1836037,"This is a fun show in a less than common setting. Sure, not every scene or storyline is realistic but for the most part they keep it on the right side of plausible.
Taylor fits the role of Walt well enough (as far as how I pictured him from reading the books) and I almost never hear his Australian peek through the American accent, which must be tough.
The real stars of the show are Sackhoff as Vic and Lou Diamond Phillips as Henry. Phillips doesn't have the physical stature of the Henry from the novels but, despite my concern it would change the character, he nails it and shows why he's been around so long.
The scenery is another star. New Mexico stands in for Wyoming and the wide open spaces and big sky are put on good display here. I've never been to either place but regardless of accuracy it is a fine backdrop for this country cowboy cop action/drama.
I quite liked the look at the Native American viewpoint on some issues that don't get much attention. The Cheyenne are an honourable and proud nation and while I'm sure it's not all accurate the show doesn't just use the res and the native people as props like some shows I've seen.
A lot of strong guest actors both recurring and episode-specific appear and really improve a lot of the stories. I liked Zhan McClarnon as Mathias the chief of the Tribal Police and Graham Greene, the Canadian legend, appears in several episodes a few seasons in and is excellent as always."
tt1836037,"Currently what I'm watching on Netflix and I'm addicted. If you're looking for something different, check out this series."
tt3358020,"This show as brutal view on the real parasite who lives on our planet.Although a alien parasite feeds on people, we get to see that the diferences are very small from the humans who kill and disrespect other creatures on Earth. The main character is well constructed and fits perfectly on the story. The battle scenes are intense and leave no trail to imagination because all things like body deformation or severe damaged are showed. The main story has the needed fast and slow pass so the viewer can enjoy some fights and then have some emotional moments.Definitely one of the best animes I've ever seen. Ps: The ""side-main character"" also a genius character :D"
tt3358020,"I honestly enjoyed Parasyte more than I thought I would. I was consistently hooked after every episode. The pacing is really great; I never found one episode boring or uninteresting. The story is just really wacky, and its originality really makes the show more entertaining. The characters are by far the best part about Parasyte. The friendship between Shinichi and Migi is so strange and yet so well developed. Plus, the English dub is really, really good; it's far better than the average dubs you'd get. Overall, Parasyte's a great show, definitely worth your time."
tt3358020,"For those who shy away from gore I'd suggest trying to make it through the first few episodes, unlike the major of the last 20+ years worth of ""horror"" this is not ""gore porn"" but brutality with a purpose, critical to the story.The violence and pain all serve a purpose, telling a story and helping to define what is/not human.For such a short run (24 Episodes) it does a unusually good job of capturing the stages of grief and the resulting ""hollowness"" that can be felt by those subjected to repeated trauma.
It doesn't stop there and even highlights the growth that can occur as a result of enduring these hardships."
tt3358020,"Everything in existence undergoes a process of change; therefore, change is inevitable; one might go so far as to call change a natural law, a universal ""maxim"". Parasyte: The Maxim is a stunning new science fiction anime with a unique story and rock solid character development. The series examines themes of transformation and change - Ovid's literary masterpiece ""Metamorphoses"", after which the opening episode is named, immediately comes to mind for comparison. Parasyte: The Maxim (2014) is based on a manga series that ran from 1988 to 1995. Most of us won't realize this fact now, but bizarre science fiction focusing on alien lifeforms was quite popular in the 1980s and 90s. Great science fiction films like the Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), The Thing (1982), The Fly (1986) and They Live (1988) are but a few examples of films that popularized the genre. Parasyte has successfully resurrected bizarre sci-fi for a new generation, and the timing couldn't have been better. The protagonist of Parasyte is not your typical hero and the plot is far from cliché. As a caterpillar undergoes change by transforming into a butterfly, so the protagonist undergoes change by transforming into a new man; your job as the viewer is to ask questions about this transformation and find the meaning behind it - ergo, what exactly has transformed and why does it matter?The plot is believable and not outside the realm of possibility considering our limited knowledge of the universe. Like Ovid's masterpiece, the anime expertly probes the meaning of humanity; what it means to be human and what makes us human; as well as the psychological and physiological state of sentient beings. Ultimately, the series focuses on the protagonist's intellectual development or more precisely his intellectual ""evolution"". The evolutionary concept of survival of the fittest comes into direct conflict with the protagonist's views on empathy and altruism which proves problematic for decision making and creates for him a moral dilemma: should he place himself in danger in order to help others? The human part of him says yes, while another sinister part of him says no. But perhaps I've said too much.The first 5 episodes set the stage for an astonishing and action packed story that follows. The series will make your jaw drop. I've seen every episode thus far and I see nothing but a bright future for this series. If you haven't seen Parasyte, what are you waiting for? This is the best new anime of 2014. It will become immensely popular. If you watch it now you will be amongst the few who can say that you were a fan from the start. Parasyte rivals Attack on Titan and Steins; Gate. If you loved those shows, you will love Parasyte as well.A top notch science fiction anime with unlimited potential. DO NOT MISS! 10/10."
tt3358020,"**This review is done by a guy who watches/plays a lot of action/violent movies, games and anime... and yet the dumbstruck reviewer finds the prominent theme of Parasyte to be way better than just mindless fighting.**Parasyte is something of a one time enchantment. Just one season and thats just it. Its something you get when elements like action + sci-fi + gore + romance + psychology are added and created by the godlike Japanese. Let me say that after 5-6 years of me turning into an adult, this is the pretty much the one that brought me close to uhh... crying, something that I never do. It made me all giddy up inside with the story driven around a high school guy with an intelligent alien as his right hand, how his perceptions about being a human and how he views humanity changes, how he becomes inhuman (mentally, NOT physically) to the point where its visible to near and dear ones. Love life aside, the protagonist often ponders about how he got this way much like we think at night about ourselves. But its the essence of the protagonist's mental/psychological change that takes the cake. He concurs that regardless whatever humans go through, certain human elements (read: compassion, envy, self-preservation,but also sacrificing oneself for the greater good etc.) can never be given up, for they are in our blood, in our DNA (though I might be overstating a bit!).Also, the pain and suffering of losing a friend (who has a crush on you and you know it) is beautifully depicted and enhanced by the heavenly music. Oh, the music in this anime plays with your heartstrings, I kid you not. And this comes from a guy who isn't affected by romance genre. Im not going ahead and praising the action and the boss-battles (well implemented), you will have to treat yourself to it but the music really is divine, combining piano with dub-step, it gets your heart pumping. I personally award 11/10 for the BGM. Trust me when I say, the music is on par with Shingeki No Kyojin (Attack On Titan). A segment of Episode 02 will tell you that, you will know what Im talking about once you hear it. I actually watched that segment repeatedly ~20 times, just to hear the BGM.It was this combination of awesome elements mixed together beautifully that had driven me to binge watch the entire dubbed series. My only *minor* sorrow (not disappointment) is that I probably will not get to watch a sequel of this legendary franchise, for the manga this show is based upon, ended 20 years ago.I have already (personally) recommended this to all my friends and will do so here, because you will do yourself a big favor by witnessing this anime. Like I mentioned, for an action- maniac, I barely got into describing the tense action sequences. Treat yourself and go for it, its on par with Tokyo Ghoul (Season 1) and a great experience.Long Live Japan, Long Live Anime!!!"
tt3358020,"Action , emotion, romance , etc it touches on everything and tugs on your heartstrings while also being to the point and no nonsense .One of the best anime out there , a must watch. If u don't like anime , this will change ur mind .Pls try"
tt3358020,"Incredible. This story is so well done I won't be surprised if it quickly surpasses the most popular TV series today. I know for absolute sure it will be on the top 10 highest rated or most viewed shows in the next two years.The social development of the characters progresses very well. The action is mind blowing. The newly grasped understanding of human nature is compelling. I just can't contain my excitement for this show. I can't wait to see it explode in popularity.I have to fill out more lines apparently, All I want to do is praise the show without any spoilers."
tt3358020,"We humans are the dominating species on earth, deciding who lives and who dies, controlling all creatures we consider to be 'inferior'. Until one day spores, containing worm-like aliens, come to earth, starting to control some of us and, in order to survive, steadily consuming mankind. These events, witnessed though the eyes of the main focalizer Shinichi Izumi, confront the viewer with many concepts and themes from modern philosophy: Egoism, altruism, deciding who lives and who dies, and who is the real parasite on earth? Is it the human who exploits his environment or the alien creature, which reduces mankind? Not to mention that Shinichi, due to circumstances explained in the first episode, lives in a symbiosis with one of the parasites, being confronted with the problems of both species. He is now a human-parasite-hybrid, with all the flaws and advantages.I personally liked this anime a lot, always catching myself thinking how I would have reacted in this or that situation :).I've been hooked from the first episode onwards! Highly recommended."
tt3358020,"after a long long time, i have been watching a quality anime.the strong point of this anime is that it has a excellent storyline,amazing body bizarre alien action, superb plot and characters,and story progresses in each episode in a good speed... it has all the ingredient to make a series a hit.only negative point of this anime is the story setup ,whic h is in the high school,which i find very common ,boring,and sometime annoying,,,,,but hey!!!as this series progresses on shinchi doesn't spend much of his time in school,rather he is busy in dealing and exploring the outside world problem.. ..................................... just keep it up!!!! worth a watch!!!"
tt3358020,"I will try to be,relatively,short. This is great anime show that will keep you glued to the screen for hours. Only thing about this anime that i can't understand is why it's labeled as horror? This is sf anime with the elements of action and drama(there are even scenes with good sense of humor about them).You will probably sense uneasiness while watching some scenes but i doubt that you will be truly frightened at any moment. Anyhow i highly recommend this one to all of you who like intelligent, interesting,drama-action anime with a bit of violence and gore every now and then.Plot is excellent and character development is very good even if it's slightly predictable in general.I will rate it 9 out of ten for now but i believe that my rating will go to full 10 if they can keep it at this level until the end of the show."
tt3358020,"Parasyte: The Maxim is a modern anime that intrigued me immediately because of its premise. With only 24 episodes, it's very easy to get into and is worth the time. There were some incredible concepts introduced in this show and they delivered. The main characters are all very likable and have great resolutions. Although I dislike the Opening, the rest of the music in this show, including the ending theme is great. Although at first the action seems like a mess, it very much grows on you with time and eventually becomes awesome and unique. Parasyte: The Maxim is a consistently great anime all the way through and is worth the watch."
tt3358020,"Great anime with a crazy bizarre story, watched it all in one weekend, well worth the watch."
tt3358020,"I really wanted to like Parasyte. Hell, for the first 11.5 episodes, I did. The parasites felt unique, the interactions between Shinichi and Migi were entertaining, and there were loads of great action sequences. Of course, even back then, there were problems. I hated Murano, the love interest with no personality other than to be either a whiny bitch or a blank slate, and few of the other characters were that interesting, either. There was also a tendency to hammer in pretentious morals about life. But as bad as they could get, they were tolerable, as the rest was generally good.But then, episode 12 ended with a really dumb middle to anyone wanting answers to a certain character's burning mystery. And it only got worse, leading to one of the worst final episodes I've ever seen. Plot threads were either ignored or ended in incredibly lame ways, characters either were utterly wasted or turned into complete balls (think Reiko Tamura) Murano continued to be pointless and unlikable, and the hammering in of its hippie morals turned into full-on dropping an anvil-no, 50 an-screw it, there's not enough anvils in the world to describe the utter lack of subtlety. There's a place for ambiguity, but Parasyte overdoes it to the point of creating full-on plot holes.In the end, Parasyte is a prime example of a good show that completely crapped on itself on the end. I'm surprised how many people love it, because whereas they see a deep, compelling show, I see a pretentious mess."
tt3358020,"The plot of Parasyte is essentially a much more violent version of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers.' Parasitic aliens (we assume, the audience never gets a definitive origin story) covertly arrive on earth and begin taking over human bodies and eating humans indiscriminately. They accomplish this by ""eating"" the humans' heads and replacing them with their own bodies. However, some humans manage to stop the parasites from taking over their brains. But as a result, the parasites eat and fuse with a different part of the body in order to survive. The Main Character, Izumi, is one of these people. The parasite was only able to take over his right arm.Because of his unlikely situation, Izumi ends up between a rock and a hard place. Since the only people who discover the parasites' existence are subsequently eaten, Izumi is the only living human who knows of their existence (at least in the beginning). However, Izumi's parasite, known as Migi (right), threatens to kill anyone who he attempts to inform. Nonetheless, the duo eventually grow to be allies as their number of mutual interests increase.I have only one complaint about this series, regarding its pace. In my opinion, the series ""crescendos"" too early. The most emotional events of the series take place in episodes 5 and 12 (out of 24: less than halfway through the series), rendering the remaining half of the series a little deadpan and slow-paced. If I had to quantify the difference, I'd say that the first half of the series is a 10 but the second half is a 7. But when compared to other horror series, 'Parasyte' is still rather amazing.Parasyte is a Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Horror series; but more than that, its very philosophically and emotionally stimulating. This series delves into the issue of the existence/purpose of altruism, which is left rather open-ended. I took the larger meaning to be that altruism, while pointless in-and-of-itself, is an unavoidable side effect of happiness, because comprehending happiness requires empathy. But every viewer will draw their own individual conclusions."
tt3358020,It's hard to say it with so many nostalgic ones or ones that transport you to other worlds but this is so well done and not to be missed.
tt3358020,"The series raises a lot of philosophical questions about human nature, What does it mean to be human? How humans relate to the environment, and whether human standards of morality can be applied to other species.. Migi, is motivated by survival instinct. It's acceptable to kill if it means sustaining himself. He's not driven by any emotion. Migi always tells Shinichi that humans do the same. They kill animals and eat them. They even harm other humans to advance their interests. What difference does it make for a parasite to do the same? Why when a superior being feeds on humans it's considered wrong? What makes it wrong/ immoral when humans do the same? This question wasn't completely resolved in the show Though."
tt3358020,"There are many reasons why this is my favourite anime of all time..The Character Development. I am always a fan of proper character development and this show is very rich in that. Some changing quickly others more slowly and some not at all but regardless if that is something you enjoy this show does it very well. The main character in particular undergoes extremely rapid change and affects how he relates to others and himself. His struggle, their struggle.. It's Heavy. I would love to talk about this in detail but to me its the most essential element of the show and I dare not spoil it.The Philosophy, as a result of the rich character development, many characters find themselves pondering the situation they are in, who they are and what things mean. And I really empathized with many characters, especially once some of them have undergone some change. I am a sucker for quality philosophy. On that note it also deals a good amount with psychology.The horror. Okay so this show isn't terrifying, and that is very much due to the way it was animated. If the anime style was darker (which I wish it was) this show would probably given me nightmares. Still there are some scenes where it is very easy to tap into what some of the characters are feeling, and it is pure dread. There is a good dash of lightness to the show at the same time.. And there has to be otherwise this show would just be so dark.The heartbreak. I cried several times throughout this series.The action. The action is the main of the show but there a good deal of it and it is done well for different reasons. From intense moments of power and gore to tactical contemplation in the heat of battle. And finally the soundtrack to this show compliments it so well. During intense moments they play this hybrid dub-step in a horror setting.. my first time through this show it threw me to the edge of my seat. The opening theme is also epic.I wouldn't consider this a show for everyone, but if you are one of those who it appeals to then congratulations! You are in for a treat."
tt3358020,"The show isn't bad, but what bothers me is the fact how dumb and stereotypical the female characters are written. Everything they care about is shinichi, they don't have a life and one of them even collected one of his hairs so she can smell it."
tt3358020,"It started out strong and I was obsessed. It's got everything, action, gore, psychological, drama, crime and even romance. My favourite parts are the ones with Migi and Shinichi, They're back and forth and character development is what sets this anime apart.The downfall of this show, in my opinion, is the romance. Satomi (The love interest) was the worst thing about this show. I hated her and her stupid voice and her stupid face and her constant stupidity. She was just so intolerable and the romance was ridiculous. I understand what Shinichi saw in her in the first few episodes, But as he developed and saw monstrous things one would have expected him to move on to someone with more brains in their head instead of idealistic naivety. I really wished he had.Look the plot and character development is good enough to carry the show, And yes the romance is annoying and terrible but you can skip it without missing much.All in all, It's worth the watch and has great potential."
tt3358020,"Today when I sit to write about this series, I honestly fail to write anything bad about this series. In the past couple of years we have seen shows of immense potential and sheer popularity, a la SnK (a big fan here). However, I would this show is even better made than SnK.All the elements like action, drama, good soundtrack, romance are present and by Gods grace not just for the sake of it. It's a cocktail of these things added in the accurate proportion that give it the real natural feel.But according to me the real meat of the show is the character development of Shinichi and Migi. How they slowly and organically come to understand each other better as the show progresses. The philosophical talks they have and the justifications of their actions.If not absolute it surely is a master of character development.P.S.: Music is one of the best I have heard, after SnK.Can't honestly give is less then 10.10/10. Go watch it. It will show you we are."
tt4277922,"It is impossible not to like this show. It is a comedy with the brilliant idea of actors playing their own role. The acting is great and the screenplay is excellent. I have not seen Season 2 yet, but Season 1 is definitely worth watching. I hope that the French sense of humor translates well in other languages. I would bet that a US adaptation is on its way (because this is what happens, they pick ideas from others). So ""très charmant"", my dear."
tt4277922,"Strong characters, good jokes, plenty of drama, glamour and de l'amour. Starts to grind its gears in season 4. First three seasons get a nine. Keeps the ninth star for Jean-Gabin the dog.Did you watch the later Mad Men seasons? A lot of frantic office and bed-hopping, people setting up rival agencies, crisis after crisis thrown at mainly well-defined characters. Dix Pour Cent (CMA) is sort of Mad Men: The Next Generation with much better jokes, less death, and well normalised LGBTness, (though race less addressed). The matriarch Arlette might well have been one of Don or Roger's party girls back in the day.Call My Agent (set in the present!) has a much more romantic French side, complete with baroque soundtrack, great views of Paris inside and out, and let's not forget the stunt casting of every French film star you didn't know was still working, playing themselves. A clever device, only possible in a drama about high-end movie agents. Times have changed - in Sunset Boulevard Norma Desmond was washed up at 44(!)I'm on S04E03 and enjoying it more for the humour and 'where will they take this-ness' than any suspense I feel for the characters. The inter-agency rivalry gets pretty one-dimensional, and relationship break-ups over and over can seem pretty forced. Glam-soap by the finale, I expect, but that's Netflix.I can see why they introduced Hicham as the psychopath venture capitalist -there wasn't quite enough darkness in series 1. But then they went and gave him a heart, too. I don't know if it's the awful man bun, his slim physique or his acting; I just don't believe the character.An image search for Fanny Herrero will reveal that the casting of Camille Cottin as the pivotal Andrea character is very likely self-referential."
tt4277922,"A fantastic show. The language is beautiful, intelligent, with a wonderfully dry sense of humour. I've watched all three seasons with fascination, and because of my brutish english ways I never even knew the stars were playing themselves!! I didnt know them. That just raises it to new levels. Nicholas Maury stands out as a shining underdog I believe. PLEASE release another season..."
tt4277922,"Just finished the second series and loved every minute. It is very smart and entertaining. I love French film but sometimes while brilliant you find they take life too seriusly. This is the first French TV series I have watched and it has won me over. Of note, season 1 was good but season 2 was much better. The characters just grow and grow on you. Can' t wait for more."
tt4277922,"I've just binged through 2 seasons of ""Call my agent"" and loved it. It's really funny and surprisingly often thought provoking. They point fingers, rub it in, caricature and tease without a hint of value judgment or sentimentality. I'm likely missing some insider jokes and some bits get lost in translation but overall it's a hoot. Keep it coming!"
tt4277922,"Dix pour cent (Call my agent) is a fantastic comedy. It's well written and acted, modern and fresh but without any politically correct preaching (because it's French, the same concept made in most other western countries would have been a disaster). The characters are human, flawed and likable, their problems relatable. Like all good comedy there is an element of drama and some sad moments. This is fantastic television.Highly recommended almost regardless of who you are, assuming you have an ounce of sophistication."
tt4277922,"Call My Agent is fresh, funny and so well done! It's pleasure to watch. From the behind the scenes aspect of a theatrical agency to the human interactions that can get twisted it's - to borrow a book phrase - a ""page turner."" Fresh perspectives, lies and blistering truths all wrapped up in a comedic bow, but a sophisticated, intelligent bow. Just such fun to watch. I can't wait for more episodes."
tt4277922,"Behind the great cast, storylines, wonderful guest stars, excellent soundtrack music and lotsa fun, there is a great deal of cleverness. Unlike American shows it is not wearing a PC corset."
tt4277922,"I really enjoyed watching the series. Superb acting, interesting characters I cared about.
Can't wait to see season 3 when it becomes available on Netflix."
tt4277922,"Wonderfully observed portray of agents and their actors, their actors playing themselves in a spoof way, at the same time hilarious and then vulnerable, and so real that you attach yourself to each agent. Very witty satyre of the movie business made with such affection that you fall for it. Awesome."
tt4277922,"I really enjoyed this series. Actually learned some French! Lol.
It had to develop. I didn't get it at first, actually turned it off midway through the first episode.
But, I read so many good reviews and I went back. Glad I did."
tt4277922,"I adored the first 3 seasons of the show. However, the last season was such a disappointment. The script writing quality went down the drain, and the show lost its soul. They should have stop the series when it was great. The absence of Fanny Herrero can be felt throughout every single episode."
tt4277922,I stumbled on this show & couidnt stop watching it. Great character development & storylines. Looking forward to season 3. Highly recommend!
tt4277922,"This little French gem of a comedy, is what you get if you combine The Devil Wears Prada and The Office (American): there are slightly sadistic bosses, demanding clients which are impossible to please and tasks for assistants that border on mission impossible but have to be on someone's desk by the end of the next day. Fanny Herrero creared a brilliant narrative with enough chemistry between the characters to keep your attention all the time, the humor isn't cheap or vulgar as it tends to be too often in Hollywood these days, and we get to see why there's such a big difference between European and American cinema. The episode with Juliette Binoche embarassing herself in Cannes shows a comedic side of her that one rarely gets to see, and it's driven home in the scene where she's sharing a pizza in her hotel room with her bodyguard. Already in a sweatshirt, but she forgot to take the diamonds off, while he asks what kind of movies she's been in. This brilliant clash of celebrities and those that make their careers happen is one of the numerous reasons to see Call My Agent. And there's even a dog called Jean Gabin."
tt4277922,"This is a delightful, easy to binge, series. The language makes you want to take up French! The writing is top notch and here is why. The characters are fresh, well developed and we feel for them, especially Camille. The theme is clear, their wants and needs clear cut. I'm not finished with Sea 1 yet, but I want to savor this series like a good burgundy. Netflix at its best. (as opposed to all the Satanic dark content they've been shoving down our throat)"
tt4277922,"What a great surprise this series is; there is no violence, murders, guns and still it's so dynamic! It has everything: talented writing, complex characters, great acting, good humor and flawless directing. It's so enjoyable, never boring and often full of unexpected turns. After so many generic Hollywood series Dix pour Cent was such great pleasure to watch. Highly recommended for connoisseurs!"
tt4277922,"I loved the first two seasons of this series. It is truly delightful, wonderful actors, attractive, flawed but seductive characters, carefully constructed scenarios, sharp and memorable dialogue and consistently funny, often laugh-out loud (not generally a French speciality) and less often but in nicely judged moments, poignant and sweet. Parfait quoi. And like all the best TV you learn to follow the characters and the subject matter, necessary of course and super fun (French cinema, show biz, the often tough business world of a medium-sized agency, but less important than the drame comique. Nothing ever goes over the top, it plays with the cinema, the jobs actors have to do, their narcissism, of course, the sheer silliness of the films and nuttiness of the directors, but it is never cruel, cliched or mercilessly satiric. The Actors, real stars all take part in a particular story and the aura of their stardom is secondary, which is quite a testament to how good each episode is, Binoche Adjani Baye etc. are merely part of the story, they don't throw anything off balance., they are humanized but not with any larger drama in mind than shaping the story.
Looking forward to the next two seasons."
tt4277922,I loved this - great characters and to see well known actors game for being involved in sometimes sending themselves up. Loved it all.
tt4277922,Last season is bad after three exemplary seasons.I stopped watching after four or five episodes unfortunately
tt4277922,"Lately I've been watching more than a few of these European productions; The Life Ahead, Bonfire of Destiny, Suburra, to name but a few, and I have to say that they leave most of the North American series in their dust.This one is a spoof on the lives of movie stars and their agents and it's top quality stuffThe scriptwriting, the casting, the lighting, they all seem to be in the hands of people infinitely superior to all but a few on our side of the pond. And here I'll give a nod to ""The Sopranos"" and ""Breaking Bad""Mostly we've had to suffer through crap like Borat and Papillon and, worst of all, Fire Saga to get us through the lockdown.I don't know what it is about those middle-aged (and old aged) French and Italian actors but they certainly bring elegance and sense of reality to the screen. The way they do wardrobe, make up and style is just perfect.In Hollywood movies they're in their track suits chompin' down on a Big Mac just after they've blown someone's head off. The continental plots have them dining with white linen tablecloths and the entire array of cutlery after doing the same thing😎
This series has you hooked from the getgo, even though the dialogue is in French the subtitles do a fantastic job and after a while you don't notice that you need them.
It's funny, it's droll, it's a different type of movie star tantrums and dirty business intrigue. If you love double dealing, lying, cheating phoney personas then you'll love this"
tt6354518,"Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan(TV) AKA 'The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.' is a Japanese gag anime based on the manga of the same name by Shūichi Asō. Kusuo Saiki is a high school student who was born with all manner of psychic abilities, including telepathy, psychokinesis, teleportation, and more. Despite having all these powers, Saiki faces all kinds of hardships and tries to avoid attention as much as possible. The story follows Saiki as he attempts to secretly use his powers to live a normal high school life while dealing with his less than ordinary classmates at P.K. Academy. Story: 8/10 There isn't any rigid story-line or synopsis. Saiki is more out to be a slice-of-life comedy anime. Animation: 8/10 Animation is good. The characters are well made to fit in their comic roles. Voice & Score: 9/10 The voice actors are doing a really great job, although the dialogue is pretty fast sometimes and it may be a little hard to follow, but it is understandable for such a short anime. The intro song is very short , but it is catchy and fits the anime. The background music, also, fills the scenes nicely. Characters: 10/10 They are core of the anime. Each and every one of them are quite hilarious(especially Kaidou and Nendou). The protagonist himself is the center of this 'flood'. Entertainment: 10/10 I mean you can't possibly count the gags and comic situations in this anime. The more you laugh, the more you forget about the previous ones. This makes the anime a watchable one to its very end. Overall: 10/10 I'm trying to be honest here that 'The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.' is 'Most Underrated' Anime of 2016. It didn't receive quite an appreciation or recognition from the anime audience. But those who had watched the anime hail the series with unanimous positive responses. As for enjoyment, Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan will definitely make you laugh with its hilarious jokes, interactions and characters! I sincerely suggest you guys to watch this 'awesome-flick' and laugh out loud!! :))"
tt6354518,My god I had such a fun time watching this anime. The japanese humor in this series is just gold. Mainly focusing on beeing non enthusiastic in every situation which to me is hilarius. But of you don´t really like anime or thinking about trying this as your first it might not be a good idea. Definetly not for everyone. Only thing that did not give it 10 stars was that some episodes where really not that great compared to others.
tt6354518,"This is the first anime I've watched that is entirely comedy-centered, and I have to say that I like it a lot."
tt6354518,"I was looking for something uplifting, so, my girlfriend suggested this beautiful show to me, and guess what? I binged it like a maniac. The colourful characters and the topsy-turvy life of Saiki K is so enjoyable it can lift anyone up, usually I also keep an eye on the technicalities but I just couldn't while watching it. This show gave me happiness and I can't thank the creators enough!"
tt6354518,"One day I was scrolling through netflix and that's when I saw disastrous life of saiki k and it sounded really ironic but I was dead wrong this show is most funniest anime I have seen in my life, i have watched this show three times and every time has been incredibleSaiki Kusuo) is the main protagonist of the series who has all kinds of ESP-related abilities. He usually avoids getting into troublesome situations. His trademark appearances contain his green-tinted glasses and two pink antennas located slightly above each ear which have the function of limiting his power"
tt6354518,"This is one of the funniest things that I've ever seen, and I watch a lot of comedy. Every single element about this show works, from the great voice acting, to the comedic timing, to the characters, to the magic, to the simplistic art style that helps make the actual animation more intricate and fluid. I would highly recommend watching this show.I don't have anything else to say except for redundant praise regarding literally every aspect of the show."
tt6354518,"Saiki has ultra strong psychic abilities, which makes me dare say that he is the most powerful anime character of all time (even more powerful than One Punch Man or Goku). However, trying to live your life as an ordinary kid among ordinary people will surely produce so much tension-- which is the where The Disastrous Life of Saiki K revolves around.Saiki is a very introverted, extremely self-reliant, boring teen, but his commentaries and how people (and animals) interact all around him make this show hilarious.The show does not follow a linear storyline and features several mini-episodes for each 24-minute episode. There is no culminating plot and the series doesn't require you to invest too much time to see the next episodes to understand a grand story. This anime is light to watch and is very entertaining and enjoyable. Highly recommended anime!"
tt6354518,"I really like how the creators mixed fantasy, comedy and romance. I don't often watch shows that fall under the romance genre but I really enjoy this one. I love the characters and setting, definitely recommend!"
tt6354518,This is hilarious show full of hilarious moment from episode 1 episode 100 i cant stop watching this hilarious Great show .
tt6354518,"After the first few episodes, I thought to myself that this could very well be the funniest show I have ever watched. The humour was spot on, and the development of Kusuo's stoic character and the exploration of his powers (and its limitations) was creative and interesting.Now, for Kusuo it is very important that others (especially his classmates) don't find out about his powers because that would create all sorts of problems for him. But this also somewhat ruins the show because after a while, all it is about is how Kusuo finds creative ways (by abusing his powers) to avoid his classmates, instead of just telling them that he doesn't want to hang around with them. For example, there is a girl who clearly likes him, but instead of just telling her that he isn't interested, he plays the very cruel game of just avoiding her and playing mean tricks on her.At this point, he ist just getting obnxious, and the show gets tedious to watch as most of the episodes just feel the same. The supporting characters only fasten the demise. The initial humour is completely gone."
tt6354518,This anime is incredibely funny! The jokes and the stories are always out of this world! I got so addicted this anime that I finished watching the first season (24 episodes) in just 1 day and I never do that so that's amazing!
tt6354518,"I thought the jokes on this were way too overpowering, maybe its the fact I don't get some humour but clearly for this one, I just couldn't just always laugh at. I mean there are bits to laugh at but most of it were not at all that funny. Dissapointed this anime didn't do the good for me but oh well..."
tt6354518,"The writing and story really works and is rather amusing.Even if you drop in at a random episode like I did originally then this series just works.
Well worth worth a few minutes of your time to check out even if you are not a anime fan."
tt6354518,It's kind of - the main character is roasting everyone in the anime. It's fun to watch. Enjoyed very much.
tt6354518,All of the charecters are so amazing and so funny i would recommend this anime to anyone who likes comedy i have watched this anime 3 times and i still love it so much. 10/10
tt6354518,"Saiki K is one of anime's greatest comedies that is less known despite being acknowledged as one of the greatest ongoing animes. Check all the funniest animes and I'm shocked to notice that this series still does not have the fame it deserves. It must be on par with gintama.
The show appears first not to take itself seriously as most things are rushed through in the early episodes but it does one thing perfectly- makes you laugh on the turn of every single episode. Never have I enjoyed any anime comedy like this. The D.L. of Saiki K made me laugh so hard. The main character Kusuo is not the funniest centre of the show unlike Gintama, school days, or Toradora. The true gold of the show are the side characters: Nendou and co. So much attention is given to a large side characters who never disappoint and really make us laugh our hearts out. For Saiki having such abilities, one will think there will be main villain or something but no. Rarely is there a bad guy threatening the protagonists. Instead the show focuses on the slice of life, and really works on the comedy. What I like about this comedy is that it doesn't invest too much in parodies such as race jokes, poking other countries, anime titles, movies, etc. Instead the anime focuses on its own unique way of comedy and trust me it will really make you laugh.
The animation is great and the pacing is great. However, more sequels should be released quickly because there is a whole lot of great arcs that can be taken from the manga. However, this anime is still stereotypical as art styles for black characters suck hard! Zolbe Kageyukouji is given a terrible art style. His lips for instance is the same as Takahasi's which is described as ugly by everyone in the show. That's very disappointing for these great Japanese shows. Look at Kilik Rung of Soul Eater and some blacks in Bleach. These are worthy of emulation. Zolbe also has those typical stereotypical ghetto character. Japanese artists and writers must really step up because there are a lot of black people who love anime but many turn away in disappointment because of silly blunders like these."
tt6354518,"Saiki's powers and introversion compound one another in this comedy series. I love that the episodes are mostly self contained so you can pick up at different episodes without missing too much of the story, although you might miss some of the character profession arcs.There is a little dialogue humor as well, but not as much as the character and situational humor. Watch the first episode and you'll be able to tell immediately if this series is for you. It's totally great for me."
tt6354518,"Best anime I have every seen, comedy, characters, jokes, everything is top notch."
tt6354518,"If you want a show about a person that's too powerful or smart for his own good watch Mob Psycho 100 or OPM. They do this character study way better overall and have great animation and action.AS FOR THE SHOW ITSELF
The first season of the show is great and enjoyable but after that it gets very repetitive and boring. Every ""arc"" is a woman falling in love for Saiki for some random reason and Saiki spends a few episodes messing with them/avoiding them. Why does every new woman character like Saiki? Whatever. Same jokes over and over. Saiki has his weird friend or he meets some weird crazy character and everyone is basically a nuisance to him."
tt6354518,"Totally waste of time.Boring
Childish
No action
No story
Just pathetic.Even saiki is like a boring person who plays the lead role in it.Don't waste ur precious time here to watch this shi.!"
tt6488862,"Having watched this drama for the third time now, I can say it is a drama worth watching again and again because at the core of it is a beautiful story of love. A love that spans many lifetimes and thousands of year. This is an epic love story of gods and goddess, placed in a mystical world where there are mythical creatures and the world is divided into many different worlds, being the celestial heaven, a place called Qing Chiu which is kingdom ruled by the Nine-tailed fox family, the mortal world where the mortals live, the underworld ruled by another royal family. There are also four rivers ruled by different rulers and a place called ten miles peach blossom where there lives an ancient phoenix who plays a crucial part in the story.The drama is based on a famous novel which there is word that the story is very similar to another previous novel. But I believe that the novel this drama is faithfully adapted from, is in many ways different from the previous novel. Different enough to not be called a plagiarised novel. The acting is top notch and the costumes are very pretty. Although this is a very long drama spanning more than 50 episodes, it is worth watching for. Because the slow burn of the episodes build the story slowly. And makes the audiences understand why things happen the way they do and nothing is rushed. I think this drama is one of a kind drama in a Chinese dramascape where palace dramas, war dramas and rom com dramas are common. The genre is Xian Xia which means Gods chivalry ( I think) basically its about celestial beings and about heroic acts. I might not be fully correct but thats the gist. If you ever feel like you want to try something new, I recommend watching the trailer and then deciding if you actually went to start watching it or not. The story starts slowly but it definitely pays off later on when you are much more invested in the characters lives and what happens to them. If you are thinking about something that it resembles, think of Lord of the Ring and Harry Potter which shows a world that is outside of mortal realms, mythical creatures and magic but with a Chinese background and more focused on the love lives. I highly recommend watching this drama to everyone."
tt6488862,"This is the most intensely romantic TV series I have ever watched. I love a drama where the chemistry works between the leads making it a joy to watch them. Mark Chao and Yang Mi were amazing. Two beautiful people who got lost in their characters and made them come alive was a true joy to watch, The performances are first rate, the sets are gorgeous and the costumes breathtaking, with an equally beautiful soundtrack. Because I love epic love stories between people who experience love and loss, I knew this would be something I would enjoy. The fact that it spans lifetimes makes it all the more intriguing. I bought into the drama and have now watched it twice. It's hard to let go.Though many people want to pan the series because it comes from plagiarized works, I don't think that is fair to the production. The script writers made something wonderful out of a mediocre novel, and that should be appreciated for its own merits. This was a beautiful piece of work and I appreciate the time, talents, and hard work of the production team."
tt6488862,"How can one actress portrait a vulnerable but passionately loved woman, (that we root for) in one section of the story, and then wooden puppet treated with polite indifference in other part? And make us feel in accord? I started paying attention when I rewatched this series. Main actors act not only with eyes, but with posture. They make us believe in those emotions. They have a chameleon-like instincts about their respective roles. Which also means that the script gave them sustenance they could work with.
Otherall, what a fantastic introduction to genre I did not know it existed! I have read comment recommending this production to people favouring chinese drama. I think that the series speaks to variety of cultures, and about abundance of universal sentiments. There is compassion, honor, rebelion, obsession, hope, resignation, depth, love, depression, anger. And somehow: characters honesty toward their own feelings, versus just response to the plot.
This is satisfying truly above and beyond Hollywood production, which by comparison seem ""rushed before cancellation"" and never developed with fulfillment in mind. Downton Abbey or British costume dramas are closest watcheable comparison.
Give this series a serious try. Expect to spend a little time on it."
tt6488862,"'So glad I persevered with this series as the story started to get specially interesting for me in Episode 11. This is not to say that I found the first 10 episodes boring because they're not - they set the stage for the rest of the series. I just got initially overwhelmed at having to watch 58 episodes. But in Episode 11, when Ye Hua (Mark Chao) and Su Su (Yang Mi) first meet, the magic hit home for me. Their every interaction is precious. Even their exchanges when he is in dragon form are endearingly hilarious, like when he thinks, ""How dare you!"" when she kisses him and he forces himself to swallow the raw meat she is feeding him so she would not kiss him again.Ye Hua is simply beautiful. Sure, the actor is handsome, but it is his manliness, depth, intelligence, wisdom, elegance, sincerity, strong sense of justice and most of all, love for and faithfulness to one woman that captivates. Another enchanting quality is his sense of humor that seems to be triggered only when he is with her like at the end when he is reminiscing their times together. Mark Chao did an exceptional job perfectly portraying such a compelling character. Yang Mi also did a great job as Bai Qian/Si Yin/Su Su. Who wouldn't find the beautiful goddess Bai Qian endearing when she gets dismayed at being labeled old by a clueless princess who has a huge crush on Ye Hua? However, I'm not too impressed with Bai Qian's fondness for wine to the point of severely affecting her emotions and decisions. Gosh, I'm sounding too attached to the characters. This is how powerful the hold this series has on its admirers. This is why I gave it a 10/10 even though the CGI is not perfect - the emotional attachment is off the charts.The love story is indeed beautiful but it is the top-notch acting that raised this drama to a level of quality befitting its exalted position as the most watched Chinese TV series of all time, with over 50 billion views as of August 2018, just over a year after its release in January 2017.Update: Watching the series a second time was an even more satisfying experience. I felt the magic from the first episode. Every scene between Mo Yuan and Bai Qian/Si Yin simmers with affection, with the mystery of ""does he love her as a disciple or a woman"" adding to the enchantment, if not poignancy, of the story. And now that I'm well aware of the significance of Jin Lian, the golden lotus, Ye Hua's attachment to Si Yin/Su Su/Bai Qian takes an even deeper meaning. A truly remarkable, beautiful, wonderful, mesmerizing series."
tt6488862,"A wonderful fantasy romance drama. They're delivering the story with beautifully, captivating, fascinating and romantic. All the settings and outfits were described very beautifully into the screen, it seems very magical and heavenly. Kudos for the main cast to portray their roles perfectly (Mark Chao and Yang Mi) and have an excellent chemistry. The OST and instrumental music blend perfectly into every scenes and i think TMOPB has the best romantic ending ever of Chinese drama."
tt6488862,"Frankly yet another great epic from Chinese Theater.
Without giving the game away, it involves essentially two
lovers who live three lives in different stages/ages.
I simply adore these legends and plays from many centuries ago,
wonderful acting, script and sets, clothing and mythological creatures.If you have also seen 'Legend of White Snake', the storyline
is (too me) along the same type of line. Boy meets girl, falls
in love; much hardship occurs - and all's well at the very end.I watch these great stories on Netflix, with subtitles, but like to
turn the sound up so I can hear the Mandarin (I presume) speech.
Without understanding, I can detect the variations of happy/sad
tomes and so forth.Watching novella's from different countries (China, Spain, Mexico,
Colombia, etc) gives me an in-look to the soul and culture of them.One thing I've noticed in many China based tales, is that there is usually a 'spoiler' - a female who falls for the same guy as the main actress, then will literally, lie, cheat, steal, connive, frame and harm her - all out of jealousy.
Don't know if that is the norm, or just for the sake of a story.Anyway, I'll leave it up to native Chinese speakers and so forth to fill in the blanks, but will just conclude by saying that I heartily recommend it."
tt6488862,"Although the story is a copied from a lot of books, but it still makes one of the best TV series I've watched in 2017. The plot is great. The only thing I don't like is Bai Qian was sent to the mortal world by Qing Cang. I think it'd be better if someone else. Or she just went trial. The performances are great, especially Yang Mi. She is such a great actress. I totally love her.There are two more things I like to mention. One is the OST. The songs from this show is great. I can't stop listening to them. And the other one thing is, although they've added extra things, it's not boring and even they make the story becomes easier to understand. Unlike the film, this one is totally better than the film produced by Crystal Liu.All in all, if you are looking for some fantasy and romance with true love, I recommend you to watch this show because it's totally a great one."
tt6488862,"I haven't watched China drama for quite a long time. Usually being turned off by the longgggg episodes and draggy storyline. This drama was highly recommended by friends therefore I decided to give it a try. I was extremely impressed with it and did not regret the time spent on it. Storyline was good with some mystery in the beginning. Actress Yang Mi did an amazing job portraying a few characters. There are many touching moments between the 2 main casts with great chemistry. Definitely a drama worth watching, the best drama i have watched over these past few years."
tt6488862,"Netflix runs it in Europe as ""Eternal Love"", but it's a little more than the mundane westernized title suggests. The story is not trivial and spans over several thousands of millenia, whereas time needs to be put into perspective here since the majority of the story's characters are immortals. The show starts off slamming pretty much all characters in your face right from the start, kind of assuming you already have an idea of the celestial who's who. After a couple of episodes though I found the cast to be diverse and distinguishable, even for foreigners. The acting is pretty broad, from bland, stern and singular face expressions via theatralic over-enthusiasm up to outstanding scenes by certain actors. Like some of the other commentators here I also found Mukdais Qurban's (aka Dai Si's) display of Yan Zhi to be among the more memorable casts.The story itself is a little irritating, starting in a pretty much epic setting but slowing down significantly and slowly transitioning into a more mundane scenery before it swings back to its epic finale. While the female protagonist character is quite likable and atypical being a kind of drunkard jester who takes time to mature, certain scenes struck me as awfully painful to watch as the characters seem to be entirely oblivious to what's in front of their eyes. A rough understanding of Chinese culture, rules of society, hierarchy and obedience to non-spoken rules is helpful to understand certain characters' behaviour.The ambience of the stages is adequate to the setting. Character makeup and costumes are very impressive, CGI and effects are just mediocre at best though. The soundtrack is appropriate for the most part, only exception being one pop-song that somehow seems to be part of the recurring theme and oddly out of place a couple of times.Subsequently, it kind of felt like watching ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" in a fantastic Wuxia setting and stretched over 58 episodes. Entertaining to watch, but not immersive enough for any tears on my end."
tt6488862,"For those viewers who like fantasy, gods + swordmanship + Daoism (xianxia) and deep, unwavering love, this is the drama to watch (I am there for the third time....it never happened before....I don't spend time watching repeats). The love story goes through three different worlds and different incarnations/life periods/instances of both lovers. The acting is superb, especially the male and female leads (Mark Chao is an outstanding actor, Yang Mi is excellent). The music is beautiful, the scenes are colourful and poetic. The computer effects are not 100% perfect, but this ""imperfection"" adds to the eerie and fairy-like atmosphere of the story. This drama will stay in your mind for ever ...it is a life changer.....
There are quite a number of logical inconsistencies in this drama, even assuming that this is a fantasy genre. However, let's remember Coleridge's concept of ""voluntary suspension of disbelief"". Even if the story is not completely logical, and even if it is not totally faithful to the book...it does not matter. This is another work of art, crafted for TV, in images and sound, and we suspend disbelief in order to enjoy the poetic quality, beauty and intensity of this wonderful love tale (and the secondary stories within the plot). Enjoy and be moved and amazed."
tt6488862,The storyline is actually good apart from the love story between the lord emperor and bai fengjiu. I dont like bai fengjiu's character. Its too much for me. Super stubborn and persistent.The rest of characters are good.
tt6488862,Very slow so much repetition and not worthy time waste.
tt6488862,"This Chinese TV series is excellent. Although the story line differs from the book (it seems), this adaptation is very well done and I wanted to see more of characters. The actors and actresses portraying the main characters (Yue Hua, Bai Qian, Dong Hoa and Feng Jiu) are excellent in their roles. The scenery and costumes are magnificent. I would recommend that you see this drama. It is memorable and among my favorites."
tt6488862,"ETERNAL LOVE (San Sheng San Shi Shi Li Tao Hua / Three Lives, Three Worlds, Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms) (2017) was an unexpectedly wonderful show, super entertaining plot and lovable characters. I was skeptical going into this one, fearing it to be another ""too cheesy to believe"" romance. However, it completely pulled me in. Everything was really well done. <3 Although this definitely gets categorized as a guilty pleasure drama.The character of Bai Quan played by the wonderful Yang Mi was perhaps one of the best female leads I have seen in a C-Drama yet. She is very loveable, feisty, witty and completely unique. I loved her character so much. Mark Chao was great in this series as well, but especially as the stoic, yet warm-hearted Ye Hua. I loved Bai Qian and Ye Hua and adored watching their love grow and their lives intertwine. They had such palpable chemistry. So adorable.The whole cast was great, honestly. Bai Fengjiu and Dong Hua were also very enjoyable. Li Jing, although broody and tormented, was also a very interesting character. I honestly wish there were more episodes, even a second season. The costumes were dazzling, the setting breathtaking and the mythology was captivating. I fell in love with the world of Eternal Love, along with the majority of the cast.And the music! Fantastic. My only complaint, and it's a pretty small one, was at some points the drama became almost melodrama, as if the emotions overshadowed the plot, slightly detracting from the suspense of impending doom. (Usually the melodrama had to do with Su Jin or Li Jing.)This show made me cry, and I don't cry easily. But the ending was very satisfying, complete with HEA. Anyway, this was a very enjoyable, creative and dazzling show. If you're into fantasy romance, and xianxia, give it a chance. Unforgettable."
tt6488862,"When I started watching this I was not sure what to expect! However I can't say enough about how much I love this show! Everything about it! It was well written and excellent actors! This show gave me hope! It reminded me of instilled values that I learned as a child as far as respect and manners however I live in the US I really admire and envy the customs and way of life in this show. In the US we have it to easy growing up I wish I learned martial arts at a young age etc. However it's never to late to learn! The love story and the reincarnation as well as the story of gods was just beautiful! My favorite love stories were ye Hua and high goddess bai chin and the emperor and little goddess. The ten miles of the peach forest was so unforgettable. And baby a-li was too cute and sweet. He brought tears to my eyes when he finally sees his mom! I wish there was a sequel to this to see what happens next! Your show really did give me hope that their are still good people in the world with respect and loyalty! Sometimes I feel in my life I want to be alone like the emperor and just worship god and study new things like martial arts, I have been studying tai chi and I also learned Reiki years ago. Also I have been studying yoga. But then seeing Ye Hua and Su Su it makes you someday maybe want a relationship like that. All I know this show really makes you think! I can't say enough good things about it! It is definitely a must see show! I have not been this excited about a Tv show in a long time. It sort of reminded me of Ashes of love I n a sense because of the gods and heavenly realm however it's much different. Definitely a different story and I like how many different stories were going on all at once! I was definitely surprised when 17s master was also the twin brother of her fiancé I did not see that coming! Great twist! I actually thought her master was reincarnated as her fiancé because they looked identical. I also did not think Ye Hua would come back to life but then again anything is possible on that show! It was such a surprising happy ending! Would love to see a sequel where Su Su and ye Hua have more babies and the emperor and little goddess."
tt6488862,"In the spring of three years ago I started watching ""Three Lives Three Worlds, Ten Miles of Peach Blossom"".Honestly at first, I was not impressed by the poster, but the more I watched it, the more I liked it. Mark Chao was so outstanding, just like Ye Hua from the story came out, but also much better than the story. Mark Chao played two roles: Mo Yuan and Ye Hua, very subtle, not to be confused with each other.
Mi Yang also performed very well: The 17th disciple was young and naughty, Su Su was innocent and sincere, Bai Qian was beautiful and generous.
The other actors also work seriously. Beautiful cast, suitable for the role.
The script is solid. Great soundtrack...
The drama is seamless from beginning to end, there is sadness, joy, sorrow, and finally burst into happiness.
The happy ending for the main couple, the open ending for the extra couple, and the sad ending for the other couple... will make nostalgic forever.
In short, the drama is very great.I will continue to watch it and be sobbing along with the stories of the characters in it."
tt6488862,Thank you for making such beautiful master piece. i am greatly anticipating the sequel
tt6488862,"I have never been so addicted to a series. American or other. When I first saw this series I loved it so much that I watched it at least 5 times before I had to make myself stop. The actors and actresses were great. I love the Bianbian, YeHua, A-Li dynamic. I can watch their scenes over and over again. Even the little Fox's love story with the Emperor. I think anyone would enjoy it. The emotional roll poster was riveting."
tt6488862,This drama is the equivalent of television crack. It reels you in with stories of desperate people desperately pleading with their unreqeuited loves to love them back. Some of the female characters are especially base and atrocious with very little self-respect (one was stabbed by the man who she forced to marry her and yet is unable to accept his rejection).
tt6488862,"Humanistic values imbued with the culture of the Orient.Cause and Effect.Mandate of heaven.Humanity.My path is my choice.""3 lives 3 worlds I met and only love you"".Thanks to the crew for making such a great film."
tt6488862,"I'm on episode 23 and I can't imagine any love story more pathetic and enraging as this series.In all iterations of their story, be it as teacher/student or strangers who married too quickly, or as gods who had an arranged engagement, the female lead was either obnoxious, unintelligent, or far too arrogant; likewise, the male lead, in who was only passably better.Similarly, the ""gods"" and their little inter-plane squabbles were underwhelming and it literally made my brain hurt to watch them fail to apply even a smidgen of logic and strategy to their decisions. Lies told that should have been refuted... this person is bad because I say so and boom, everyone believes that version because no one cares to use their brain or maybe the writers just liked keeping the characters dumb in order to advance the plot as they desired.Don't get me started on the actors who played the king and sons of the Ghost Tribe. What in the world was all that overacting. The maniacal laugh and the overly expressive gestures?? Baby, this ain't Shakespeare, dial it down by 10.The lot of them were pathetic. Gosh, I can't express how angry I am at this nonsense. Where's the LOVE?!! Not one couple in the entire series actually has a love worth envying or rooting for. I will finish the series but there's an awful lot of fast forwarding that'll be done.On a positive note, the set design, costumes, and locations were breathtaking. Hence the 5 stars."
tt6488862,I literally binge watched this epic love story. The acting was amazing the characters endearing. I fell in love with this story.
tt6488862,"Fantastic cast and production! After watching this not even half way through the first episode, I was totally hooked to all characters especially leading actor and actress. Absolutely fell in love with the story and how it took me on the emotional ride. One of most romantic story that I've seen. Also I love the costumes, fluid and poetic action scenes. Songs and music for the series were so well chosen, fit so well with the story😘❤ Love all elements that compose this production. Thank you so much for producing this infinite love story that expresses realistic human emotions and how true love can come cone conquer it all🙏❤"
tt4565380,"I am American. I am biased. With that out of the way, I wanted to... no, felt that I HAD to write a review about Fauda. Being completely honest with myself, I can't review this show based on ""realism"" or the whether the portrayal of ideological differences are genuine or not; I'm not exposed to that on a daily basis like those in the Middle East are. What I can review is how this show changed my mind and opinion about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and how it made me feel. I went into this viewing with a prideful appreciation of Israel (I still have one) and expected to see an action-packed thriller about undercover operations. You do get that, don't get me wrong, but that's not the point of the show. What you get from this show is a very poignant lesson about the physical, emotional, spiritual, and ideological toll that is felt in the battle that this show is portraying. You get the sense that what you are viewing is real. The writers do a masterful job of convincing you to sympathize with even the most unwavering of Hamas supporters and warriors and with the Israelis tasked with hunting them down. You get a front row seat to the endless killing that is carried out by both sides for reasons that are not even clear to the triggermen. ""An eye for an eye"", to what end? There is no Hollywood romance sideplots, no flashy explosions or high speed car chases through oncoming traffic, only death and despair. This show has been incredibly difficult for me to describe to my friends and family, and I can only tell them what it's about and why I believe it's not a biased depiction of the real war going on. But I can't describe how you feel watching this show. It's profound and eye opening. All I know is that we're all human, we all mourn the same way."
tt4565380,"I'm amazed at how the Israelis can make such high level series like this, dealing with such intense subjects relating to dealing with the Palestinians, but still manage to be fairly even-handed and treat both sides sympathetically - even terrorists. I think it's this that makes Fauda so good. Yes, you're on the side of the Israeli team - sort of their undercover SAS squad dealing with Palestinian terrorists - but you also see the other side's viewpoint. Fauda is violent and action-packed, but all the characters, on both sides, have depth and believability. Watched all three series in a couple of weeks. Well worth the time."
tt4565380,"I have never lived in the West Bank, and thus cannot speak to whether the script is as severely biased as some claim. What I do know is that among those who voice this particular criticism, there does appear to be roughly the same number of people who think it is demonizing the Palestinians as there are those thinking it's the Israelis that are getting the unfair treatment.Why I don't believe it is possible to ever be completely unbiased, I do not get the sense that the show is trying to convince me one way or the other. This tale of ruthless killing and unending retribution does not, in my opinion, make any attempt at justification. I believe it a story, not primarily about the common Palestinian or Israeli, but about the combatants on both sides. However, I can see how a passionate supporter of either side might find this show a bit unpalatable. Those who simply want their convictions justified can probably find something more to their liking elsewhere. Propaganda is easy to come by these days. The rest of us can enjoy this well made fiction, listen to the beautiful semitic languages and be captivated by the awesome culture and piety of these ancient civilizations. I pray for lasting peace among all the seed of Abraham."
tt4565380,"The best Israeli series made until now.Surprisingly authentic, played out great, well filmed.The highlight is a language, Arabic language, spoken language, music to the ear. No language barriers ""gib AL hawia""(Bring your ID card).Excellent playing actors.Faithful to reality.A Must see Series to Arabs and Israelis. Muslims and Jews.For those who want to see and understand how a country forced to operate in an environment full of terror driven of national motivation.And anyone who enjoys quality action series."
tt4565380,"I just finished watching season 3, and in short, it is a good series that depict the life in both Israel and Palestine, like what they eat, their culture and traditions. So in the beginning, you feel hopeful that Israelis want to learn from Arabs and vice versa, but then, the series become very cyinical, when in fact the only reason they ""learn each other language and culture"" is to creates pain and sorrow.I wanted to root for the Shin Bet team headed by Doron, but I couldn't. The lack of morals and restraint when inmocent Palestinians are involved, just show how imbalanced this war is. They have no policy of taking prisoners. They simply shoot to kill, even enemies that already surrendered.Also, they recruit informanta and collaborators among Palestinians, who endanger themselves to help Israelis, but Israel never helps or rescues them, so normally they end up dead.And another irony, is that the more terrorist they kill, the more replacements they create, because all the orphans, siblings that become destitute and homeless (it shows Israel blowing up houses of innocent people), so in the end offering their life to Hamas is the only resource left.The show missed an opportunity to show how to de escalate the conflict. In the end, it jsut fuels more hate and sectarianism"
tt4565380,"This Israeli series is centred on a counter-terrorist squad working to stop Hamas terrorists operating in the West Bank. This involves them frequently going undercover into situations where they must pass as Palestinian; the slightest mistake will put them in grave danger. In the opening episode we are introduced to Doron Kavillio, a retired member of the team who is asked to help when a terrorist leader who was thought dead re-emerges. Soon he is back in this deadly world. Their first operation goes wrong; the target is wounded but escapes and his innocent brother is killed. This leads to tensions rising and revenge attacks. While this storyline is wrapped up in the first season a new terrorist leader emerges in the second so it is effectively a continuation of the same story. The third season sees operations against another terrorist which leads to the kidnapping of two young Israelis. They are taken to the Gaza Strip... a location far more dangerous than the West Bank.I really enjoyed this series; I can't comment on its actual authenticity but it certainly felt real. We observe characters on both sides of the divide and while it is clear that Doron and his team are the 'good guys' there are plenty of sympathetic Palestinian characters, and the Israeli's actions aren't always what one would call moral. There is plenty of tension in every episode and early on it becomes clear that just because somebody is set up as a main character doesn't mean they can't get killed. The cast does an impressive job bringing their characters to life although as I relied on subtitles I can't comment on the quality of accents or Arabic spoken by the team... something that would need to be near perfect in reality. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the genre.These comments are based on watching the series in Hebrew/Arabic with English subtitles."
tt4565380,"Kudos to other reviewers who intimately understand the Palestine/Israel conflict. Their reviews are in-depth and broadly cover the topic.Allow me to present the perspective of someone who knew little more than the fact two countries are battling over land. One heavily represented in the media as an ally of the Free World, the other portrayed as a nation of extremists and terrorists. And this from the occasional media I watch and hear in Australia (another allied nation).So here's the kicker: Fauda, an Israeli series depicting the very conflict I've just mentioned, manages to infuse its tale with humanity, love, family and friendship. And it does so on both sides of the fence. Two clear enemies, major stakeholders in the war they wage, are shown with objectivity and fairness. Both men are flawed, both men are biased and heavily indoctrinated in their cause. Yet both have wives and kids they adore, and both men wage their war in the hopes of creating a better future for their families.That being said, war is ugly and the price paid is often high. Fauda does not stray from this reality and the ripple effect is ever-present, slicing its way through the lives of those embroiled in the fight; some guilty, some innocent.Woven through these fundamental connections are the various political and military involvements. Watching the puppet masters at work is both interesting and disturbing. Nothing is ever straightforward and Fauda is no exception. There's always someone watching or listening and there's always someone a step ahead of you. In essence, Fauda is wonderfully acted, riveting, fast-paced and even educational. It is a superior series and deserving of the praise it has received. I truly look forward to Season 2."
tt4565380,"(Review updated after Season 4).Doron Kavillio was once a member of an elite Israeli counter-terrorism team. Seeking the quiet life he has retired to own a vineyard. His peaceful existence is shattered when he learns that a Hamas military leader, the mastermind behind the deaths of scores of Israelis, a man he was convinced he had killed, is alive and well and planning another attack. He quickly rejoins his team in their hunt for Abu Ahmed.Superb drama. Shows well the Israeli-Palestinian struggle, from both sides. Solid, very gritty plot: feels very realistic and there are no indispensable characters. Not at all predictable: some great twists and turns, all without feeling like twists just for twists sake. Great action scenes too: once again quite realistic in feel - not over-the-top gung ho stuff.From the outset the series also demonstrates the vicious cycle that is the struggle in the Middle East, as violence just begets violence. One side will kill someone from the other side, and the other side will avenge them, perpetuating the cycle. Also shows how innocent civilians get pulled into this cycle: people determined to stay out of the conflict get sucked in once a relative is killed.There's also a great sense of pointlessness to it all. The Israeli team is tasked with tracking down and killing high profile terrorists / operatives. When they accomplish this there is a sense of achievement but they know it will be short-lived as someone will just replace that person and the whole thing starts again, never to end. This is even admitted to in a discussion by two Israeli agents in one of the reflective moments in the series.Amongst all this there are also some great sub-plots involving family life and relationships, making for quite engaging viewing as you get to know the characters and what they're experiencing behind the scenes.Season ratings: S1: 9/10, S2: 10, S3: 10, S4 9.5. S1 was less well-rounded in that it didn't show much of the family/relationship stuff and concentrated almost exclusively on the intrigue and action. From S2 onwards the writers added more depth to the plots and characters. S4 started strongly but dragged a bit in the middle episodes before returned to its best. Incredibly tense and powerful ending."
tt4565380,"Fauda is a very intense and rough show about the Israeli - Palestinian conflict. No side is a saint or hero. All means and methods are used from both sides. Sometimes with success and sometimes big failure. Terrorism, revenge, fight for injustice, all causes are there.The show is very well produced with a nerve and authentic feel that is not present in similar US productions. The characters are strong and very well performed by actors and actresses, unknown to me but nevertheless stellar performances. Key character is Doron, an undercover Israeli agent that is both prudent privately and ruthless as a professional. But he is often held back by his own emotional turmoil, impulsively guided by his natural instincts and careless maneuvers.Also the acting and development of the character Walid, on the Palestinian side, is absolutely splendid. The action is constantly there and it is impossible to predict what is going to happen next. This really brings an intensity and always keeping you on the edge. Still it feels natural and not overdone.The show has been critisized for being Isreeli propaganda. It is an Israeli production so it might be a small bias here, but still there are good people and bad people on both sides. And both sides can be totally ruthless without any sense of moral and ethics. So all in all the show is a great two-sided portrait of this ongoing conflict. It is very intense and unique because you see both sides of the conflict. A very refreshing alternative to traditional US action productions. Don't miss Fauda!"
tt4565380,"Liked the first two seasons a lot, but series three definitely tipped over into melodrama, involving too many improbable coincidences and contrived situations for comfort. The show even became quite soapy in places, with the Doron character sweeping every female character off her feet, in spite of looking like Vin Diesel's tubbier brother! He was a problem for me in other ways as well, mainly to do with his almost pathologically unwillingness to obey orders. Would any special forces unit really go to war with someone so unstable in their ranks? Still worth watching, but lost quite a bit of its realistic feel."
tt4565380,"I didn't watch this to fully understand the complexities of the Israeli and Arab conflict and to believe it represents fact. That out of the way its a good, well acted action drama series. The very end to series 3 was also quite unexpected. Never going to win an Oscar but a very good and not too taxing to watch action series. I recommend this. Binged on Netflix using Hebrew dubbed into English and with the Arabic in English subtitles."
tt4565380,"The most important message of Fauda is that there are no good guys.Both sides in the show are doing essentially the same thing, one under the pretense of maintaining law and order, the other under the pretense of freedom fighting. However, if you're watching Fauda in order to learn more about Israeli - Palestinian conflict, you're obviously in the wrong place. This is not and never pretends to be a documentary.Season 1 and Season 2 offer a bleak insight into the lives of the Israeli special forces team trained to infiltrate the Palestinian side in plain clothes. Their job is literally nerve wrecking, both on and off duty.However, Season 3 takes more of a Hollywood approach, meaning that we're led to believe that a group of highly trained individuals may take on a (small) army and emerge victorious. Therefore you might as well stop watching Fauda after Season 2."
tt4565380,"This film does nothing but portray Israelis as heroes and Palestinians as savage. In the show, Israelis kill Palestinians in cold blood, yet the movie downplays it, as if these people are just pieces of meat. But if an Israeli gets shot, the show makes an excessive drama out of it. How biased and one-sided can a movie be? I'm really disappointed to see this series has a score above 8. I wish I had never watched it.Notice how they portray Palestinian and Israeli soldiers. The Israelis are depicted as incredibly strong, capable of handling large numbers of soldiers with only a small group. I really expected to see a movie that felt authentic, but this movie doesn't feel natural at all."
tt4565380,"I don't know exactly how many series were made about Israeli palectinian conflict, but this one is, I am sure, among the best. Taut, sharp, gripping, pulled by an awesome actors directing, above the best I have ever seen in a TV series, but unfortunately smashed by some mistakes that should have been avoided. The gunfights are for me the weak points; Palestioians are too easily shot, like in a sideshow shooting gallery, see? So, the Israelis seem to be the super heroes, and I think that's pretty lousy, if you consider the quality of the show. The same as I you sa a fly in a bowl of milk. The contrast is too obvious. But, I repeat, acting is here over the top. The second season is the best of the series so far, and the third is, for my taste, too much focused on the hostage case, and this is different fro the second season. But the sad and totally unpredictable ending saves this third season, that, why not, asks for a fourth seaon. Let's cross our fingers."
tt4565380,"Wow , just great is all i can say. Didn't seem to have any bias. it demonstrated how complex the conflict really is. Its great that they show how there is pain on both sides. I also loved how the actors spoke a mix of Hebrew and Arabic. Arabs and Jews came together to make this show and I think that is really great. This is super addictive so watch out! I watched 6 episodes in a row and I definitely don't regret it one bit. Definitely recommend this show, you wont regret it. The acting, the filming, the effects-its all truly amazing. Unfortunately , I think this show only has one season, which is really upsetting to me. Hopefully the series will continue for as long a possible. 10/10"
tt4565380,"There are many negative reviews, saying that this is not anything close to reality. The reality is yes, there is some dramatic license, but much of it is based on truth.From what I know, having a connection to the production, only the characters are dramaticized, but the storylines reflect the reality, sad as it is.As for the absurd comments about the Arabic spoken. Many of the actors are native Arabic speakers, so there is no basis to them.There's a reason why this show is so popular, it's because it shows balance. It also let's talk understand both sides, caught in a miserable situation."
tt4565380,"Reading some of the reviews I have noticed that those who sympathize with the Arabs hated the series and those who sympathize with Israel or don't know much about the conflict loved the show. Knowing a lot about the conflict, I can say that the series is a little bit GENTLE to what really happens in real life. The conflict is deeper and unfortunately will not be solved in my lifetime or (in my opinion) ever. However, the show gives a semi-realistic glimpse of what happens in the area. The actors are authentic, raw, and some of them have lived it in real life during their military service.
I loved it! The acting is great, the filming is good and can't wait for the 3rd season that is now being filmed."
tt4565380,Knowing little of the Israeli - Palestine conflicts and issues I watched this series initially only because of a review I read somewhere. Not really into watching something with subtitles I was gripped from the beginning and couldn't stop watching it.Perhaps it was learning about something or some place in the world that I know little of or perhaps it was the story line. Either or this was a fantastic series to watch and you remained intense through out the show. The acting is great and film is shot with an excellent eye. Beautifully done.Because of this show I've now educated myself further in the issues of the lands of this area of the middle east.Can't wait to see if there is a season two.
tt4565380,On of the most captivating web series if you are interested in the genre.
tt4565380,"There are too many films and series about the Israeli Mosad and IDF to go into. Suffice it to say this one simply tries to throw in every known cliche and just comes off bland. It is almost a parody of itself in that only the israelis could have the lead of a balding, obese hairy middle-aged man be the love interest to a hot professional, younger Arab woman. It is unapologetic about killing Arab civilians in the course of their operations from the beginning of the episode. So, if you like watching creepy israelis having sex with their subordinates/co-workers' wives, all while killing Arabs, then this is your wet dream."
tt4565380,1st series was excellent. 2nd series was good 3 series is just meh? I was looking forward to another season of Fauda but I was left disappointed.
tt4565380,Really like the tactics and shooting scenes. It's nice to see professionalism and not total Hollywood style theatrics. It's hard though I'm sure they don't want to give away too much tradecraft but I do enjoy it.
tt4565380,"I think that a lot of the negative reviews are probably people who have a problem with the show's politics. Palestinians need to make their own version. I'd watch it, if it were decent.Things I Didn't Like about Fauda:In almost every scene with the potential for action (why people tune to this genre instead of family dramas), the director steps all over it and waves it away like a pesky fly. They rush through scenes that should have been well-choreographed. Why? So they have more time to show people screaming at each other?Their interrogation tactics are the worst I've even seen in movies. The Wire did a million times better at this. The old ""just beat it out of them"" strategy is an insult to 1950s movies. Physical torture may actually work if you have something that can be confirmed almost immediately, say you need someone's PIN for their ATM card. Few people could resist torture in this situation, no matter what the consequences. However, if the interrogators are asking about someone's whereabouts, something that could take hours or days to verify, any trained operative would just spit out a load of crap. Why would you tell the truth? They did this time after time and it's completely stupid.In almost every confrontation with the enemy, most of them confrontations that the team instigated, they were woefully outnumbered. The basic principle of warfare is to always have superior firepower. Then there are the really stupid things like failing to cover a back door when raiding a house. Really?I've seen grease fires with more discipline than this supposed crack anti-terrorist unit. They screw each other and each other's wives (well, wife), they have physical altercations between themselves, they mutiny, and they can't follow simple orders. Some of the infractions deserved jail time.Things I liked about Fauda:Had this been made by an America company, it wouldn't have had nothing resembling the authenticity of this show. They would have all used English all the time (the worst is when they have really stupid accents). My Arabic isn't bad, but I can't really judge accents, but I found it interesting that an Israeli show used Arabic much more than Hebrew.My favorite characters were Captain Ayub and Abu Samara, who were basically two sides of the same coin, both men sort of playing both sides."
tt4565380,"I have never seen an original Israeli TV shows before. Since the war on Hamas started, after initial shock, I've decided to look it up a bit further. So this show popped up on my radar.This show is amazing! It's everything the Hollywood gritty shows are trying to be, only so much better and more realistic. Both me and my wife started watching and we've watched 4 seasons in a span of 6 days, missing sleep time, and it was absolutely worth it! My wife who doesn't like or care too much about the action scenes, even got emotional toward the end of 4'th season. That's how good it is.The actors aren't ""Hollywood pretty"", but they are perfect and amazing in their respected roles. They aren't superheroes. But a hard boiled professionals with deep psychological wounds, deeply engaged in the conflict, all while embracing both cultures. For the most part they speak Hebrew and Arabic, and it's perfect for the show (yes, subtitles are a good thing). I especially loved phone conversations when it was Hebrew on one side and Arabic on another.I don't believe this show can have a good remake in Hollywood. It just doesn't build like this. Western values don't work in Arab world. Only hoping to see more seasons of the same. Maybe with different actors as they get older, but the same spirit.Amazing!"
tt6333098,"This documentary series searches the proceess and the purpose of design arts at a very high level. It also cares about the people and artists it portrays, often digging into their personal lives. The subject matter and how they are portayed and explored are always impactful and worthwhile. The themes are applicable in the very minutae of the specific art sphere explored, bur also philosophic, personal, profound and open-ended to be applicable in life and daily thoughts.Mostly, these are inspiring profesional stories and riveting information on the works and behind-the-scenes stories of some of the top innovators in their fields. These people are changing the world. Thank you for the series to put such a deserved spotlight on these worthile topics.After 2 seasons, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi's 2 episodes and showrunner Morgan Neville's 3 episodes are stellar, but even a lesser episode is of high quality and insight. Learn about Architecture and Bio-Architecture and how Typecast is much more complicated than you probably think. What is Design FOR play and how can that possibly change our future? Watch Abstract: the Art of Design and with your family and friends to find lots to discuss and discover."
tt6333098,"It is fascinating to see this sort of focus applied to the creation of what we might otherwise take for granted, and appreciate not just the art, but the artist behind this work."
tt6333098,"anyone who loves art, or an art student, or an artist has to watch this series... 8 different artists way of thinking, way of living... and how they do and describe their art... a fantastic 6 hours full with art and love and passion... be sure you will not regret... just watch it... and make your kids watch it also..."
tt6333098,"I have been waiting for something like this for so long!!! This is absolutely a great documentary, great content and great people. I watched episodes multiple times while working on my art as I felt that they are talking my language and sharing my thoughts.I want to thank the whole team for this documentary and all the artists for sharing info with full transparency with the world. You made me love my work even more! Thank you "" Abstract "" team. Design is for everyone. CAN'T WAIT for the new season!hj"
tt6333098,"I went 30 years without a TV and one of the first shows on Netflix that I watched after getting one was Abstract. Very high quality designers were featured so I thought I'd found a show that I could turn to to watch on a regular basis. Then it was discontinued. I still lament that and wish that whoever was producing, directing, writing the show would do it again. There are so few options in the art and design field. If the powers that be are reading this, please know that you would have a following if enough time were given to the show to get the word out."
tt6333098,"The show is excellent, is well directed and very well produced, but what I like the most is the very honest way to present the persons behind the work, they are not presented in typical PR or marketing way, they are presented as humans with some gifts and some struggles, their stories are truly inspiring mostly because are not fantastic or heroic, just because they are very human."
tt6333098,"I wish I saw these masterminds and master-do'ers when I was 10..11..14Talking series: visuals, narrative, sound... it's great.Oh my the content!!! I'm especially blown away by Neri Oxman and Bjarke Ingels. People I did not know and truly amaze!This is educational material for philosophical classes, biology, technical classes, psychology, sociology or to impress 10 year old kids and possibly make a life changing imprint. It shows assertiveness, motivational power, creativity and connectivityWOOOOOW"
tt6333098,"The quality is mediocre. The story telling is the vulgar myth building and even if it is a very usual way of telling stories, the creators do not excel at it.Overall it's trivia plus misunderstandings from people with limited education. Take the second episode. One man qualified in making pretty drawings and very qualified shoe makers do some shoes. They are pretty. They are comfortable. That is undeniable. But step any way further away and one steps into superstitious crap. There are no doctors in the team, no physicists, no biologists. Because the performance increase comes from the comfort and not from any performance babble. And just because a famous ball player wore these shoes and got paid a huge amount of money, that does not mean Regular Joe won't sprain an ankle in the exact same pretty shoe. The ball player might have an excellent game bare footed, because he is the blonde with big boobs using a power drill in the advert.Short: nice to hear those people talk, even if they have no idea what they are talking about.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch"
tt6333098,"One of the standout qualities of the series is its ability to showcase the breadth and diversity of design disciplines. From architecture to illustration, graphic web design to footwear design, each episode highlights a different field and introduces us to the exceptional individuals who have made significant contributions to their respective industries.Through interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and stunning visuals, the series takes us on a journey into the minds of these designers, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of their inspirations, challenges, and the transformative power of their work. It celebrates the creative process and reveals the dedication, passion, and ingenuity that drives these artists to push boundaries and redefine what is possible. The production value of the series is top-notch. The cinematography is visually striking, capturing the beauty and intricacies of the design process. Combined with a thoughtful and engaging narrative, the series succeeds in creating a captivating and informative viewing experience. ""Abstract: The Art of Design"" goes beyond simply showcasing the work of these designers; it also explores the broader implications of design in our everyday lives."
tt6333098,"Let's face it, these design episodes are meant to entertain rather than to provoke any intellectual thinking. Some designers are genuinely inspiring (such as Niemann and Devlin), it's just that the way the ideas are presented... it seems to tick all the boxes of clichés in terms of what people think of design. I'm sure if asked the right questions, some of the designers will be more illuminating.The episode most fraught with clichés and posing? Hands down, Neri Oxman. All the superficial citations of well-known figures and mindless mentions of concepts and stories. And all the love for nature without remotely looking like she gives a d*mn about the conservation of it."
tt6333098,"The ephemeral nature of the beauty we try to copy vs the lasting impression of experiencing the flow state of creative expression is the endearing and intriguing subject matter, one that the producers explore with varying levels of success.The first one in the series is my personal favorite for the sheer brilliance of solving the impasse between the interests of toy manufacturers and the urgent need for gender neutral toys.Highly recommended viewing."
tt6333098,"Season 1 was amazing, each episode was fascinating and the story telling of design is riveting. However, season 2 has become a documentary about people and social issues instead of design itself. This is very sad and disappointing. I can't even finish half of the episode about Ruth Carter who is a costume designer..."
tt6333098,Season 2 gets the full Netflix treatment of shoving political agendas down your throat. The show is now more about politics than it is about Design.
tt5231950,"This historic drama was for the most part excellent. Majority of actors were very good except for Cyndie Yu (Zhu Qing) felt could have been better acting on her part or better choice of actress for the role. Sad story, not that romantic except Guo Zen part with Zhu Qing. All and all definitely worth watching."
tt5231950,"1. Great drama
2. Great acting
3. Heartfelt
4. Human frailty
5. Female point of view as well as male.
6. Untold story of history.
7. Evil side of Communism
8. Didn't mind subtitles with the drama that pulls you in.
9. If this does not get awards it should."
tt5231950,What an excellent historical drama about civil wars in China. But all the cast and team are Taiwanese. It proof that Taiwan is the orthodox heritage of Chinese culture indeed. Not China.
tt6611916,"SHOW IS CANCELLED, THERE WON'T BE A SEASON 3So here's the deal, I just read this and I wanted to share with people since I enjoyed this show: Netflix owns the IP for Kingdom, and in SK they tend to sell different productions around IPs they own like web novel adaptation, musicals, theatre, you name it they do it, only so they can actually make money out of the IP. Netflix - and this came straight from the creators - denied their request to have the IP expand within SK market, maybe even international market considering how successful and popular this series was, so they weren't making money out of Kingdom, so why would the creators keep focusing on an IP that isn't worth the hassle since Netflix can flat out stop them from making money?That is how the series was ""cancelled"" without being cancelled, Netflix has 0 interest in cancelling the show because it is popular and they make money from it, but the creators don't have interest because they can't expand their adaptations and actually make money out of it, so Netflix washes their hands, you won't see any news like ""Netflix cancels popular series"" because by contract they place the whole responsibility on the creators. Such a shame because it was a very unique IP."
tt6611916,I'm a great lover of k drama and horror films and the Koreans do it so well I've just binged watched all six episodes in one sitting ( it's now three in the morning ) as I couldn't stop watching yes the acting was a bit ott in the beginning it didn't matter and I didn't see the twist coming in the last episode can't wait for season two hear it's got the go ahead if you love zombies and k drama don't miss this
tt6611916,"It's hardly a secret that the zombie genre is a dried out well proven by western releases fighting to be the most boring and generic junk out there. Then to my pleasant surprise South Korea dishes up a series set in a Korean dynastic kingdom in 1897 where a crown prince tries to save his land from the horror. And it does it well. Good acting, believable costumes, lovely cinematic and the monsters blends into a wonderful time that makes this series worth your time."
tt6611916,"As my title suggested I am amazed at the successful combination of different genres so to speak. It was a really fresh idea to place zombies during the Korean middle ages(Joseon era) a direct contrast to most zombie films we see today, located at the modern urban landscape. The decision to do that breaths new life to the so far tired zombie genre.Moreover, what I found incredibly interesting is the ""subtle"" commentary on the extremely hierarchical korean society, which is the actual disease that has consumed the nation. Look no further than where the disease started (the king is patient 0) and the way that the society tries to deal with their dead; seperating the bodies of the rich from those of the poor, giving proper burial to the rich whereas burning the poor. Instead of dealing with the actual situation they choose to focus on formalities even when those can endanger the living. Not only that but the Confucian principles of not harming the body(burning,cutting etc) are only to be applied to the rich. The society is so much plagued with an archaic system of principles and conduct that they fail to see it for what it actually is, the disease itself, in that sense not only the zombies are infected but everyone.Btw no guns and slow zombies in this one like the Walking Dead. Here zombies RUN, no time to waste and the living ones have to use whatever tools they find, mainly tools used in agriculture and farming!In terms of visual aestetics the series looks stunning! Amazing cinematography, directing, costumes, locations, action scenes, it is truly impecable.What I would like to see is stronger female characters as the series is very male dominated.Good job to everyone involved and can't wait for the second season!!"
tt6611916,"If you remotely like East Asian productions in general and Korean ones in particular and are a fan of the horror and zombie genre as well, this one is for you and not to miss. Add to that a historical setting with many subplots and subtext, and you get an idea of what kind of complete package this series is.
The only bad thing I could say about it is, that it ended after just six episodes and only half the answers were given with me wanting to get more of that show.
Strongly recommended."
tt6611916,"This show is amazing in many ways. It is estetically gorgeus, has got a great plot, good acting, and so on. But most of all, it speaks about our society more than one could believe: it is about migration, about the happy few exploiting a large mass of people in misery and in starvation, leaving them out of their lands again and again, as if they were just garbage. I think this is one of the best zombie thing of the last few years because it talks about now, truly folllowing Romero's path."
tt6611916,"What can I say? Netflix does it again! Great directing, writing, and acting; overall cinematography is 10/10. Can't wait already for Season 2!"
tt6611916,"Thanku Netflix for being global and introducing us to a different filmmaking schools other than Hollywood. WE the non-American viewers are sick and tired from hollywood's films that shows Americans trying to save the planet all the time. But thanks to Netflix we can see different and more beautiful art by (Korea, Spain, Italy, etc. )."
tt6611916,"Season1
A series that deserves much more success. A season 1 too short unfortunately, but six intense episodes. The cast plays very well (there is Bae Doona, an actress whom I like very much!), The characters are interesting, the concept of zombie apocalypse in a medieval era and very well found, and the political intrigues add to the tension all the way. The best zombie show I have seen, personally. A beautiful little South Korean masterpiece that has nothing to envy to big Hollywood productions.
.......................
Season 2
Kingdom doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does add new twists to the zombie mythology by introducing the quasi-vampiric nature of its flesh-eaters."
tt6611916,"This show is so worth watching, a zombie story with depth!That is something you never get, it has an interesting storyline running all the way through, not about zombies.They are more like a secondary storyline.The zombies are not like you see in most other shows, they are there and they attack but the focus is not on the blood and gore, they are wild people, not slow walking bones.The story is about people doing anything to gain ultimate power.The zombies are referred to as monsters, but truly it is the humans that are far worse.So far the show has been very surprising, there are tender moments,
great displays of loyalty and revenge, along with espionage and evil doings.The fight scenes are plausable, not the typical Chinese martial arts over the top stuff, no one flying through the sky or running up walls.It is really one of the best zombie based shows I have ever seen, the movie is good too. I hate subtitled material, but I don't mind this at all, it is well worth it. Even if you are fed up of zombie stuff, watch it, as I said it isn't the main focus.So watch it, enjoy some good writing, acting, scenery and special effects."
tt6611916,Worth a watch. Season 2 ending makes little sense though.Would easily be a 9/10 if they had gotten that right.It seems that they threw all logic down the drain towards the end.
tt6611916,"While it is better than 80% of the zombie flicks out there, I feel this series is let down by some horrible over acting. And some ridiculous characters who I assume are there for some sort of comedy value.One minute it's trying to be serious walking dead style horror, the next minute you have bumbling Laurel & Hardy type characters screaming like girls and falling about the place.As for the people giving it a 10 rating...if you consider this a perfect ten, holding it aloft with the Likes of Breaking Bad and the Wire you need your head examined."
tt6611916,Netflix is getting way better every year just an amazing zombie serie its like game of thrones meet the walking dead
tt6611916,"Great story - politics, war, relationships, humorCompelling characters - strong femaleSuspenseful and funny scenes, with entertaining dialogue and surprising eventsTRUE horror elements including dread, fear of the unknown, impending doom, truly shocking scary scenes, taboo breaking & gruesome events (like mom zombies & kids). I will leave it to your imagination.Multilayered plot / build up to epic battle of human vs zombies and humans vs humans (political war for control of kingdim)SCARY ZOMBIES - Fast, Gory, IntenseNo one is safe"
tt6611916,"Has to be one of the best series in 2019 by netflix, I know I know its only january just now. But what a beginning to the year. You cannot miss it. Just wrapped up the season its brilliant all the way through. Beautiful costumes, amazing cinematography , brilliant gore, hints of comedy, good balanced action. Not too much of anything and not too little. Great gripping storyline throughout with an amazing lead role.
Not a spoiler ***** i died laughing at the head-cuffs scene ***** u'll know when u see it."
tt6611916,I waited for a long time for this one and boy it didnt disappoint..great show
tt6611916,Kingdom on netflix was exciting. Can't wait for season two!
tt6611916,"I only checked this out of curiosity but got pleasantly surprised how good it was and ended up bingeing. Every episode is full of action and there's no dull moment. At first I thought the idea of mixing period drama with zombie is laughable but with here, it works. Overall great and I couldn't wait for the next season!"
tt6611916,"I rarely write reviews, especially for series. The Kingdom definitely deserves one.I've never been a fan of zombie movies/series, I find them very bland and uninteresting. So I was very skeptic about these series too. I was so wrong!I couldn't stop watching it from the beginning. The actors did an amazing job, I fell in love with the costumes and the cinematography. It kept me on my toes until the very end!If you haven't watched it, do it, you won't regret!Can't wait for season 3, hopefully we will see it soon."
tt6611916,"I was recommended to watch ""Kingdom"" by a friend, as he knew I love everything zombiesque, and somehow the South Korean horror drama ""Kingdom"" had managed to elude my radar.With ""Kingdom"" readily available on Netflix, I sat down and watched all 6 episodes of the first season in rapid succession. While ""Kingdom"" is no ""The Walking Dead"" in a South Korean interpretation, it is still a rather enjoyable TV series because of equal parts zombie action and storytelling.""Kingdom"" is somewhat hindered by a rather slow pacing, that while it definitely helps the movie and story, it just made me feel that it took the series forever to get up in gear and to become good. But the slow pace was necessary, I suppose, because it helped establish the character gallery quite well, while offering bits and pieces of adrenaline-filled segments to the audience of things to come.While ""Kingdom"" is not following the average (and generic) zombie formula, it is still a very enjoyable show and it is an interesting approach on a zombie outbreak. One thing that I am usually not enjoying is agile, fast and running zombies, but it actually works quite well in ""Kingdom"" for some reason.This is a TV series where zombies are a part, yes, but it is not a TV series about the zombies. No, this is a drama about well-defined and nicely portrayed characters and their quests for survival, hunger for power, revenge, political plays and such.The TV series have a very nice ensemble of casted actors and actresses to portray to the various roles and characters in the show. I was definitely more than pleasantly surprised to see Doona Bae (playing Seo-bi) in the show, and she brings with her a lot of grace.The zombie make-up is adequate, and it serves its purpose quite well. As stated above, this is not a TV series about the zombies themselves, so it is not richly endowed with gross and ghastly special effects displaying gore and other such grim things that are often a major part in the zombie movies and TV series. Was that a good thing or a bad thing? Well, naturally as a massive zombie fanatic I would like to see as much blood, guts and mayhem as possible, but the toned down brutality and gore of ""Kingdom"" actually suits the theme and atmosphere of the TV series quite well.The downside to ""Kingdom"" is the slow pacing of the story. While it was a mere 6 episodes running just short of an hour or so each, it felt much, much longer. But it is hardly a deterrence for me to shy away from season 2 if it should make its way to Netflix.""Kingdom"" is definitely well worth watching if you are a fan of the zombie genre, and need something to fill the time in between other zombie shows."
tt6611916,What a great series even though I am not a fan of subtitles I could not wait until the next episode. This is cerntialy a must see. Can be a bit gory at times. I cannot wait until the next season is out.
tt6611916,"The acting is great, the cinematography is incredible, the production value is outstanding, and yet we are left with a plot that is pretty simple and predictable for the most part. I enjoyed this, don't get me wrong, but I was really expecting there to be higher stakes and significantly more tensions throughout. For a horror series, it was only until the final episode that I ever even got a good jump scare. I respect the use of actual extras to perform as the zombies, but holy crap--some of these extras are so silly in their body language/performance/movement that there is no hiding their human-ness regardless of how much makeup you put on them. Characters are very simply defined without much moral ambiguity, increasing the simplicity of the story.Will watch season 2, but this series is not yet ground-breaking beyond it's production value."
tt6611916,"This series is terrible. The plot is poor, the acting is awful with terrible 'over-acting' and ridiculous facial expressions. On top of that, it is very poorly dubbed and translated. If you think this is one of the best horror shows ever made then you clearly need to watch a bit more.. Maybe give Haunting of Hill House a watch instead.. I'm annoyed at just how misleading the ratings are."
tt6517102,"You know, I never imagined Netflix's Castlevania would turn out to be such a solid series back when the first season came out. Season 2 was phenomenal and Season 3 might be even better.Taking place not long after the events of the last season, Castlevania Season 3 starts off strong with a focus on dialogue and character development which continues on for the majority of the episodes in a slower pace than what we've been used to before but justified and interesting since now there are several new characters, the world and lore is expanding (amazing worldbuilding), and the characters we know already getting further development (well-written and voice acted). There's also a lot of politics and scheming, kinda giving you early Game of Thrones vibes, and all of it was intriguing.And while that's great and all, we are also treated to some truly magnificent fight sequences where the animators flex like crazy. And since the story grows and flows properly, those sequences become even more enthralling and thrilling aptly personifying the world 'Climax'.On a technical level, it's a straight-up bump across the board. The art, the animation, the sound design, the soundtrack, all of it has been improved and I loved it.It's hard to say whether I prefer season 2 over season 3 or the other way around because my favourite character is Dracula. But what I can safely say is that if you've enjoyed the previous two seasons, Season 3 will surely blow your mind. There's so much in it I didn't even expect or imagine that I'm purposefully being vague in order to not spoil anything. Watch it asap, I highly recommend it. And if I were to rate Season 3, I'd give it a 9/10.P.S Trevor and Sypha are so cute together. And BADASS!"
tt6517102,"Really solid production from Netflix that knows its target audience and doesn't pull any punches. Make no mistake; this is animated fare strictly for adults. And that's perfectly fine.The 2016 production of Berserk has sadly skimped on production values, leaving fans of the longtime manga series with a sour taste in their mouths. Castlevania, however, scratches much of that same itch. It's gratuitously violent, dark as pitch, and set in a medieval fantasy world. The writers go straight for the jugular and pull no punches, obviously inspired by Berserk and other series like it. It's refreshing considering that the original owners of the Castlevania IP, Konami, have taken an obvious downturn in the quality production of their various legendary properties recently in favor of instead developing pachinko and gambling machines and firing longtime creative leads such as Hideo Kojima. Fans of the series need not worry, plenty of the classic Castlevania feel is here, treated with proper reverence by the shows writers and directors.The animation is very good, and the art in particular is superb. Animated features and series have been steadily improving since the dawn of the HD era, and Castlevania continue to represent them well. The English voice cast shines as well, with Armitage's performance standing out among the others. He does a fantastic job as Trevor Belmont.My only complaint here is the brevity of the series. Four ~23 minute episodes is not that much content, and it makes me wonder whether Netflix wouldn't have been better served to put this ""season"" out as a feature-length prologue film instead in order to advertise a lengthier season 2. But all-in-all, it's worth the time, especially to those interested in the Castlevania series, but even to those unfamiliar with it and in search of a gritty, well-animated, well- acted piece of dark medieval fantasy."
tt6517102,"Netflix made a good choice adapting this franchise. Castlevania has a fluid history line, with iconic characters and a beautiful art design. The soundtrack is not bad either, some Gothic and melodic songs, that make you chill with every encounter through the series. The only problem with Castlevania is the lack of explanation in some parts, and the size of the first season (only 4 episodes).Castlevania is loyal to the games and has some incredible art design.It deserves your attention."
tt6517102,"This show is really really perfect and so underrated, i wanna thank the creators and all who contributes to make this show, please make more shows like this 💕💕"
tt6517102,"I'll cut this short. Castlevania is only 4 episodes due to it being the prequel to the actual show, Season 2 will feature 8 episodes based on Castlevania 3. Adi Shankar might have questionable taste in makeup, but his work ethic is incredible. Every person working on Castlevania was made to play Castlevania 3 on an NES from Ebay. This show wasn't made to rake in dollars, its first and primary concern is to make it into a goddamn masterpiece and while its not finished so I really should be more responsible with the way I'm rating it, from what I've seen I'm damn impressed. The animation quality is incredible, above most Japanese anime which this show clearly mimmicks. Voice acting is perfect across the board, the action is visceral and gory, but not mindless. The story and its pacing is unique and doesn't pick up on many generic tropes. It's a unique prequel to what is yet to come. This show is for adults, its almost objectively the best western ""anime"" (Korra was primarily animated by a Korean studio, that said I'd still rate this higher) and unless you like good bad movies enough, its the best video game adaptation I've ever seen. Honestly I haven't felt hyped for anything for possibly a decade now, I've learned that hype results in nothing, but considering the directors work ethic, his past work, experience and what Castlevania is right now, I can't feel anything but hype."
tt6517102,"Season 1 - Amazing.Season 2 - Outstanding
Season 3 - Amazing and Outstanding
Season 4 - Best of them all.When I went in to watch Season 4 , I had my doubts. Usually , by the time of later seasons , some shows lose the narrative and wander around here and there but not Castlevania. Season 1 builds the story , Season 2 improves it , Season 3 focuses on character development and Season 4 brilliantly brings it to a close. Belnades and Belmont , ""The"" Alucard and the forgemasters. Each of their individual stories are brought to a fantastic close leaving the viewer satisfied as hell. No stone in their story is left unturned and while you once hated characters like Lenore , you warm up to them and while you once loved characters like Saint Germain , you turn cold towards them. Isaac who was a side character by season 2 but becomes one of my favourite in Season 4. Hector who I also come to admire later. The only cons I have which are in no way major is that the dialogue felt a little recycled as the writers just needed to fill out some space. The actions scenes were cool as hell but maybe too overused. The comedy was amazing and you have to give credit to the voice actors as their delivery is on point. For anyone that hasn't watched Castlevania , It is witty , funny , filled with suspense , brimming with horror , has amazing character development , has epic storylines that all come to interjoin with each other. THE best anime I have ever watched especially outstanding and unique amongst it's western animes. This show is a MUST watch."
tt6517102,"MUUSST WATCH , Every episode is much better than the previous one all actions all twists and full of enjoyment you will never regret it and please leave good ratings so people watch it too"
tt6517102,"The Castlevania anime on Netlfix was fantastic. As a huge fan of the series, this was truly what it needed. I wanted it to be much longer though; at least 13 episodes or so. You can tell Konami took no part in the creation of this, because it actually had love for what the series was. On top of that, it follows my favorite Belmont, Trevor. While of course it had no ""Vania-esque"" music like the games, it did not need it. It felt in every way like a faithful Castlevania anime. Ignore the low ratings on here. Their opinions are utter garbage and are awful reasons for their scoring.I eagerly await the next season and so should you."
tt6517102,"When I fired this up, one of the most amazing things happened. I was 5 minutes in before I openly realized the characters were voiced in English and not Japanese! And really, really good voice acting! I know there have been good American animated shows and movies made, but to me, the last time I saw such great English voice acting paired with Japanese (style) animation was the Spawn animated series. I consider that series a classic and outsider... and now we may well have another!There are obviously a number of quality pieces put into place to make this series - production, cast, writing. This is exactly the type of project a fan holds their breath and hopes, but does not have too high of expectations. Expectation shattered - this is high quality stuff! Very brutal content including horrific deaths of innocents, graphic violence, and no mercy shown... Hooray!!!The villain, Dracula, is humanized immediately, which gives him cause and texture - not just a mindless slayer. The hero has a number of anti-hero qualities, which just makes him more interesting. Undoubtedly this series will unfold with a number of awesome battles and conversations that question morality, cause and purpose.The content obviously will not be for everyone - wholesale slaughter of religions figures, women and children may prove to much for some, but for others? A true surprise and fun refreshing release.Enjoyed like a fine wine 9/10edit: finally got to the 2nd season, and while I won't change my score, the 2nd season is a disappointment. Everything is in place for success, production wise, but the content (by comparison to the first season) is restrained, common, Boring. the charm of the first season was how refreshing the content was, which included exciting, entertaining, sinister content. The first scene in season 2 attempts this, but does so in a completely anti-entertainment manner! All the fun of the first season is absolutely smashed right to begin with, then the viewer gets 2-4 episodes of dialog, with very little action, and when thing finally do get going? Not that interesting! What happened? It's like the main creative force behind the first season was intentionally fired, and someone more PC was hired to make a generic, boring (albeit well produced) sequel! I doubt this is what happened, and likely good intentions just led to an average product. But damn! I expected a way better follow up to what I considered an instant classic first season."
tt6517102,"The latest season keeps up the momentum of the first two seasons. I just want more, so much more. I want a 100 episode season more."
tt6517102,"I'm not going to waste your time. Make some popcorn, get a drink and start watching it... Thank me later..Edit: I had to change the rating from a 9 to a 10 after seeing the trailer for season 4! What is up with this show? How do they do it? It feels like it's getting better every season! This forces me to write a longer review.First of all, oh my god the voice acting! I've never heard better voice acting in any anime ever, period. And believe me, I've watched many animes from FMA, Attack on Titan, Dragonball and One Piece to less popular ones like Chobits and Ajin, both, in English and Japanese.Then the character development! This show can seriously rival Game of Thrones in that regard. The characters are so well written and versatile that they truly bring this fictional universe to life! There are certain scenes and dialogues in this show that even thouch philosophical ground, truly remarkable and unique for an anime! I can't remember the last time an anime made me think about existence and identity.What else can I talk about? The music is phenomenal, the animation is astonishing, the fights feel meaningful and inevitable and i love it when a show knows how to do that. The upcoming (and probably final??) season looks very promising as well.Game of Thrones used to be my favorite show but now Castlevania takes the cake! Seriously! 10/10!!"
tt6517102,"In four short episodes that amount to just over one and a half hour, Castlevania does a good job of introducing its basic plot and characters. Due to time constraints, this is all the first season does, and they couldn't have made a better decision. The atmosphere is great and the static backgrounds are a treat to the eyes. The biggest problem is in the animation. Often, movements are limited and stilted. The voice acting is great, but the almost static faces fail to live up to what the characters are saying. Hopefully, the creators will have a larger budget in season 2(the show has been renewed for 8 new episodes), and will address the technical issues that prevent Castlevania from being as thrilling as it should,"
tt6517102,"Disclaimer: While I'm an avid gamer, I won't be judging this show for how well it adapts the source material, the Castlevania series of video games. Instead, I'll judge it by how well it stands of its own - as any honest reviewer should.Mixed feelings about this one. Castlevania has some of the best visuals I've ever seen in an animated show, great action scenes, overall nice atmosphere. If that's all a show needs to be good, I'd give Castlevania a 10/10. But here's the thing: it's NOT enough. There are also things like story, plot structure, pacing, acting, characters... I'm sorry, fellow video game connoisseurs, but I have to say that Castlevania has some serious problems with those.The premise of the show is as simple as it is dumb, but much could've been forgiven if the story that followed was developed and - more importantly - presented in a sensible manner. That didn't happen. Pacing is horrible - at times the show seems to drag on for no reason. There's a lot of filler, while the better parts seem to be compressed. The characterization of characters (the acting) and their choice of actions (the plot) are often idiotic to the point that it's distracting and immersion-breaking. The show is incredibly stupid and devoid of nuance, like it was deliberately made in such a way that even a five-year-old could understand it - a needless concession, considering the absolutely-not-family-friendly content of the show.You know how when you're watching a really cheap, badly made live-action TV show, you'd sometimes think to yourself: ""Gosh, that's so stupid. Why would they do that?"" in regards to the writing decisions of the show-runners? That's how I felt about the entirety of Castlevania. Obviously, not every story can be (or needs to be) a Shakespearian work of art with deep philosophical undercurrent. But there needs to be at least some substance, a meaning, something, anything for the brain to latch onto. As it stands, Castlevania only has pointless filler, designed to carry the events from one action set piece to the next. And it's not the 'turn your brain off and enjoy'-kind of situation, either - the show is too slow and too pretentious for that, and there's no tension to keep you engaged.The overwhelming praised this show has received is really surprising. I've seen people describing it as 'the best animated video game adoption'. Really? Are we really so desperate that we gobble up any soul-less piece of fan-service, as long as it doesn't outright butcher the source material? 'It's based on a video game' is not a valid defense, nor is it a valid excuse for the show being so stupid. For crying out loud, I've seen actual games that can rival the very best of movies, TV shows, and even literature when it comes to quality of writing and direction. There is absolutely no reason for us to be content with something as low-quality as Castlevania.Action scenes and visuals are the only redeeming qualities of this show. Perhaps it is enough of a reason to watch it, but I suggest lowering your expectations quite a bit, unless you want to feel intellectually-offended."
tt6517102,"I was in the mood for some great anime binge watching and FINALLY got around to watching Castlevania. Years ago I played the video game one time and totally sucked at it, so when this premiered I wasn't very interested. However, after reading several reviews I decided to give all four seasons a shot and I am glad I did. This was fantastic on so many levels, but for me the stand out was the absolute stellar voice acting. Richard Armitage shines as Trevor Belmont, and Graham McTavish brings the thunder as Dracula. After I watched all the episodes, I just went back and started watching them again. If you haven't watched this or are on the fence don't hesitate any longer. If you like anime or adult animation then you will love this. If you love tales of the supernatural then you will enjoy this. If you just love a good story with a satisfying ending then you WILL LOVE this.10/10."
tt6517102,"My all time favorite animated series remains AIRBENDER, but there is a rare purity to this story which is almost hypnotic. Callis as Alucard and Armitage as Belmont are nothing short of brilliant."
tt6517102,"I think the show is fantastic both first and second season, but I am disappointed in the way that there is simply too little, like the Warcraft movie, if you are gonna do it do whole heartedly, why not start at the beginning with Leon Belmont and how Dracula came to be, and workout a series of good seasons based on one of the best game storylines ever created?I'm done with season 2 and I just want more, and I really hope too see some lord of the shadows spin off down the line. I'm just hoping Netflix will continue their work on this series because GOD I think it's good with potential to be completely amazing!"
tt6517102,"This series is a gem. Everything about it seems like art. It's always emotionally complicated when a story has as sympathetic a villain as they do here with Dracula. I found myself literally rooting for both sides. I hope there is a 3rd season and if there is, I hope they find a way to keep the story as top notch as it has been."
tt6517102,"Ellis' character development is absolute second to none. I have watched every episode multiple times each. So tender, so brutal, so melancholy. If you are a fan of the game series, you will watch in utter glee. Every season, every episodes builds and builds and builds but never disappoints. This franchise has been delivered into loving hands who have created an almost masterpiece. Thank God Nexflix seems to keep its popular animated titles going. YES I DID JUST KNOCK ON WOOD!"
tt6517102,"I went in expecting a fun romp, perhaps with a nice homage or two. What did I get? Video Games answer to Game of Thrones.I am not too heavily invested in the original Castlevania series. My first and really, only game that I played was ""Symphony of the Night"". Truly a work of art, a masterpiece but I didn't play the games prior and only saw the games after on YouTube walkthroughs. Though I learned a bit about the rather rich lore.When I heard this was being made, I didn't know what to make of it. There are way too many bad movies and TV shows based on video games (which is sadly nearly all of them) and some of them had NO RIGHT to be bad. Max Payne, Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed immediately come to mind in that regard. Even the Final Fantasy movie, Spirits Within was rather lackluster and it was directed by the series creator and visionary, Hironobu Sakaguchi (Though I think there were production issues and ""too many chefs in the kitchen"" during that time)! I had just given up on VG to screen adaptations.Then after many friends told me to watch these few episodes, I was curious at most... but then it grabbed my attention when I heard that after the series premiered and got critical acclaim; a second season was confirmed and announced IMMEDIATELY after it was released. So I made time for it... and I am so sorry I didn't watch it earlier. It is nothing short of spectacular!It opens up with a scene which was heavily inspired by Symphony of the Night (I won't dare spoil it) and it shows WHY Dracula is the world's enemy... and it's really friggin' heart breaking! Then we're introduced to Trevor Belmont in a way that is both epic and hilarious!I think that's where I should stop because I don't want to spoil even the slightest detail. The characters are great, the voice acting is absolutely brilliant! Kudos to Armitage, Reynoso, McTavish, Frewer and ESPECIALLY Callis! I did not expect that voice to come from James Callis, so low and rich and he's surprisingly intimidating when he wants to be.The score is great too, but it's Trevor Morris. I've come to expect good work from him. Seriously, I don't get why he hasn't composed a score for something like a Marvel movie yet he really knows how to work the scenes.The writing is outstanding. Warren Ellis is a very solid writer, his work on the 2011 X-Men animated series is truly something to admire. The animation is BEAUTIFUL! Absolutely stunning! Anime inspired styles done by a Western is something I do have a soft spot for, even the ones which are a bit ""standard"" !but this is just gorgeous-and where, WHERE did they find Sam Deats!? What an incredible debut! Apparently, this is the first thing he has ever worked on as a director... That is hard to believe. This is definitely a love project, you could FEEL the respect that was being put into this!It goes to show that when creative freedom is given to the right people, you really can make artistic magic with ANYTHING! Right here is proof that video game to screen adaptations can work. It took nearly two score and twain, but they finally did it!Kudos to Sam Deats and the entire cast and crew for this masterpiece! Also, expect a few Annies to go to this series. I'm expecting Callis to get the award for voice performance as Alucard."
tt6517102,Just finished season 3 and I'm already waiting for season 4.
tt6517102,"Complete Review Summary of (Seasons 1-4)This isn't the first animated project based on a video game series and certainly won't be the last, but it's by far the most memorable and most well executed.Castlevania does what so many fail to do, they keep it simple yet entertaining. Regardless on if you have played the games or know nothing about the lore, the show makes it easy for newcomers to understand the and engage with the plot, while keeping things original and fun with the fans.The voice acting is superb and the soundtrack is splendid, but where this show really shines is its graphic and beautiful action scenes and cinematic animation.Whether you are a longtime fan of the Castlevania games, love anything Vampire/Supernatural or enjoy a good anime this is the show for you. The series starts off strong in the first season and has a satisfying ending that while may not suit everyone makes you feel like the entire journey was worth it. Would highly recommend."
tt6517102,"I watched season one and the first few episodes of season two. The beginning is pretty interesting, but over time it just gets more boring. All the technical aspects, voice acting, animation, and music are fantastic though so there's that."
tt6517102,"First when the series appeared on Netflix I was excited as Castlevania is one of my favorite game but I am not happy with the results.Although the animation art is not bad it is not Ayami Kojimas art which was amazing.Today they could easily replicate the style of Vampire Hunter D:Bloodlust from Madhouse inc. which would have fitted better to the world of Castlevania.Actually this series lacks everything what made Castlevania games fantastic: story , characters and music -yes the cool music from Castlevania is not there.Sometimes you can hear a familiar theme but it quickly goes away and through the episodes you either hear nothing or a silent meaningless music is going in the background.This tv show deserved so much more, but the stories are slow, halting and some of the characters like Isaac is depicted as a moron when he kills people after receiving the mirror and top of it he goes with his little shop of monsters to look for a ship and the captain welcomes them just like normal people.The screenwriter really knows how people would act in a situation like this..The voice acting is also boring.You become sleepy while just listening to the powerless conversations and again if the music would be good it is not. A lot of unnecessary cursing during dialogues which are absolutely not fitting to the characters. The potential is there but somehow the creators, writers and actors did not do their homework. Unfortunately this is a poor realization of an amazing story."
tt7752034,"I usually don't find myself hooked onto any show I am watching for the first time lately, but I didn't even flinch while watching this. I feel like I am traveling with the presenter and his crew to all these unique, informative, inspiring places with delicious, cultural food.
Phil is the best part of the show other than the cultural aspects, he is a lovable, sweet, curious, childlike man that beams so much positivity that I cannot help but smile while watching this.
If you are into a more informal approach to food and travel that isn't so serious and instead soaks in the true and naive joy of travel, watch this."
tt7752034,"My spouse and I stumbled on this show on Netflix and fell in love. Unlike some celebrity travel/food shows, this one is unfailingly fun and informative. The emphasis on positivity and Phil's slightly goofy but warm and absolutely unpretentious approach to the people and food he encounters is so uplifting. Highly recommend and hope there will be a season 2!"
tt7752034,Such a lovable quirky guy traveling to wonderful places and meeting the locals. The food part is great but not over done. The best part of the show is Phil and his wonderful attitude and love of life. Also the theme song is fantastic!
tt7752034,"Many have criticized how Phil handles the show, from his quirky face expressions, to a lack of knowledge about food and so on.
I think those are exactly the things that make the show unique. Phil is funny, heartwarming and the fact he does not have a PhD in cooking is what makes the show more authentic. This is a show about how food connects people and how food is a way to learn about cultures different than our own. I love the parts where all the crew goes and eats food in the middle of filming and the conversations Phil has with his parents in the end of each episode.
Easy, uplifting, heartwarming"
tt7752034,"My wife and I are thoroughly charmed and entertained by this show. We binge watched the entire second season on Netflix! Don't let the negative reviews by snooty sophisticates like Greg Morabito (Eater - Jan 1918) put you off. Phil is funny, and exudes a human genuineness and warmth that is wonderful to see in these jaded times. I am planning a trip to Lisbon based largely on that particular episode. Keep 'em coming, Phil!"
tt7752034,"In a world of perfection and serious exactness a welcoming place to land is often not professional but a relaxed entry way to community. Phil suggests it is not the percisness of the ingredient but the people that you come in contact with, the unexpected location and the joy of the experience. Phil is not the culinary master, thank goodness we have enough of those, each being better than the last. Phil celebrates a life that the unusual, different than where we are and communally the same. Excellent videography, lighting, delightful music."
tt7752034,"Love this show. I don't want to try to do it justice by writing a lame review. Just watch. (And don't let the REALLY BAD theme song deter or distract you. I actually downgraded my review when I fired up episode 3, because the song is so lame. It seems more like the song for something like Small Wonder or Alf. Come On Vietnam !!) This show made me want to cook and live creatively; go outside my comfort zone more intentionally; and love more people (culturally speaking) more deeply. Worth watching. Just mute it during the theme song."
tt7752034,Love Phil. Stay happy. The world should be filled up with people like you.
tt7752034,This is the best US food show about genuine authentic food and mixed with sharing experience with great friends. Very nicely done! Phill is funny and just pleasant to watch.
tt7752034,"A part of me loves anthony bourdaines edginess and attitude, but a bigger part of me loves phil more for his humor and warmth. Theres literally nothing not to love about someone feed phil."
tt7752034,"This shouldn't really work as well as it does as its primarily just a guy travelling the world feeding his face on great food, with a little bit of a travelogue thrown in between each meal! The main reason that it does work so well is because Phil Rosenthal has so much enthusiasm and so little pretension that you are swept along and almost feel that you are eating the meals with him. There is a genuine warmth and sense of fun and I can't understand why he isn't at least 5 stone heavier given the amounts he manages to eat on each visit! A great programme to watch just before or during your main meal - dangerous at any other time if you want to stay the right side of obese! Excellent theme song as well which sets the mood from the outset."
tt7752034,The best food show I've come across in a while. Phil makes me laugh so much and his smile is contagious. I have never written a review before but after seeing a negative one I can honestly say this show is not at all dumb. Thank god he doesn't know it all! I am so tired of seeing shows about know it all chefs! Phil is like a normal person who people that don't travel much can relate to.
tt7752034,"Although it feels like a guilty pleasure, I admit I enjoy Phil's good humor, his endlessly enthralled take on things. Especially fun are his interactions with his parents. Some reviewers long for the grumpy-but-informed musings of Anthony Bourdain, whose shows I also like, although I often squirmed when he made very obvious fun or got angry or annoyed when things didn't meet his standards. Both men display the ""ugly American"" syndrome but for different reasons, but I digress. Phil! At the top of each show, he habitually boasts simpleton cinematic or US pop culture knowledge of the places he's just come to. Can't somebody brief him or put a book in his hand on the flight over? It's embarrassing, shameful. His narration is simply about the food and how nice and warm (or not) people are. Can somebody do some narration so we get a bit of context, which Tony does well, I might add? These places don't exist in a vacuum. Finally, for the love of god, Phil, STOP HUGGING EVERYONE! Not everyone wants a hug or ""does"" the hug, which is painfully, cringingly obvious. It'd be a good lesson to viewers (who will book plane tickets in droves, potentially) for him to make a practice of asking his on-sight guides in front of the camera how people like to be greeted or treated. Don't just impose big ol' bumbling American-style customs, as if we're all the same big happy family. It's a teaching moment that he's completely oblivious to. Phil's interactions are superficial and shallow - yet likable, like idiots can be likable."
tt7752034,"I want to like this, as all the locations and the food are beautiful! I just can't stand Phil, very awkward and unfunny, which comes across very in natural and fake."
tt7752034,"These are my favorite travel and food shows. (Both Somebody Feed Phil and I'll Have What Phil's Having). I watched the first episode a month ago, and felt in love with it right away. Phil is so down to earth, friendly, super funny, and is such a nice guy! I enjoyed and laughed a lots every time I watched the show. Phil represents millions of us out there, who are not food expert, but enjoy food, love to travel, and want to see and learn new things from different people around the world. Can't wait to see future episodes."
tt7752034,"We love watching Phil eat his way around the world. After each episode, we say, we need to go to that place. His humor is so real and when he face-times his parents, they are just typical Jewish parents. Can't wait to see where he goes on the next series that is suppose to start in July."
tt7752034,"I have fallen in love with this show. I cannot emphasize enough just how sweet and open the star, Phil Rosenthal, is to everyone. He has a child-like enthusiasm for everyone he meets, and he's so respectful of the country he visits. Don't get me wrong, I love Anthony Bourdain's snark and sophistication, but when I need to be uplifted, I watch Phil be charming with a bunch school children singing and dancing a goofy dance. He does this without becoming saccharine or fake, and the show succeeds because Phil meets all kinds of interesting people and eats all kinds of interesting food all over the world. The food and location are still major stars, but it's the people, shown through the lens of Phil, that remind us that there's still plenty of wonder and good in the world."
tt7752034,"I can see a few reviews here of people who are so aghast and insulted that someone that is so happy, kind and optimistic should host a food show-I mean aren't we all supposed to be happy when we taste something new and exciting?I love this show!"
tt7752034,"Phil is an American travelling the world. But unlike others, he's not closed off to other cultures but rather open and almost childlike in his energy and general happiness to be where he is. This show is not just about food, it's a way for him to engage with and meet people.
He's not a gorgeous hot young adult, he's REAL, he's himself, he's not trying to pander to the masses by making himself like everyone else. If you ever watched/enjoyed Everybody Loves Raymond, you'll understand his humour and hopefully appreciate it and his style.
I've watched all the episodes more than once, love it every time more and more."
tt7752034,"A friend told me about this show and I have finally started to watch it. Have watched only 2 episodes so far, but I love it. Phil Rosenthal is an absolute joy to watch. His enthusiasm for the food and for the people he meets is completely without guile and totally real. I highly recommend it, especially now in this stress filled time in which we live. Total escapism and armchair travel. I cant' wait to watch the rest and I hope there will be more."
tt7752034,"Sorry but Phil is the wrong person to be on this tour. Knows nothing about food, stupid jokes and just not at all engaging."
tt7752034,"It's a pg versioni of Anthony Bourdain, which I actually quite like but I find Phil slightly irritating, with his exaggerated facial expressions and obvious humour, to be fair he actually seems like a really nice guy but it's like he is playing a part. There's enough quality and interest for me to work round this but occasionally his cartoon expressions will grate. So overall it's just ok."
tt7752034,"I hope Phil keeps doing these shows. The show is funny, informative and entertaining! The best all around ""food"" show I've ever watched. Phil's face when he loves the food is awesome!!"
tt7752034,"I mean the show itself is really good, but why the hell would they pick someone like Philip Rosenthal. Nasty-looking eel creature that does not know anything about food. Especially his expression every time he tries something, just makes me hate this guy even more. He's the complete opposite of charisma in general, and can make situations awkward with his baby-ish personality. He looks like some useless little boy who just makes matters worse. Anyways, that's all I gotta say. The show's good, but don't get me started on Phil."
tt7752034,"I love food shows even if the host isn't great. But man this show is clearly more about the host than the food which is fine if the host is someone good. But this philip rosenthal guy really irritated the hell out of me. Hes there in the real world with real people and he keeps acting like hes in a 90s sitcom. I guess some people might like this but as someone whos a fan of the Anthony Bourdain style of food shows, I could not stomach this show at all."
tt7976532,I have quit watching countless Netflix drama series after an episode or two. More often than not theres nothing that hooks the audience in. Either the plot lacks character or the characters lack heart. This Korean based series draws you in on the first episode with the introduction of the series rookies. You see what drives them and you cant help but cheer them on. This is fresh material that I havent seen on Netflix in awhile. I hope there is a season 2.
tt7976532,"No matter what your ethnicity, where you live, or nationality, love and compassion are the same. I cried, laughed and smiled through these episodes. This is one series I didn't just watch...I experienced."
tt7976532,"Every summer, the South Korean television industry puts forth the best and most promising shows and crosses its fingers that the public falls in love. Of course, not every show can be a surefire win; it can often take weeks before a show hits its stride, or they may just lose their momentum and drop off altogether. Luckily, this show is the one that makes the public fall in love more and more after each of its episode.
Instead of the serious, bleak, and depressing atmosphere that recent South Korean police or detective series such as ""Signal"" or ""Secret Forest"", ""Live"" is very refreshing, heart-warming, and realistic. Just as the title shows us, this series does not heavily focus on police corruption or the police force's long, troubled history of misconduct toward the community it exists to serve. Instead, it paints a vivid, detailed picture of the police's daily struggles and how they overcome those day-to-day difficulties to fulfill their missions and somehow make their lives less miserable. These cops have to live their lives right, so they can help others live right. Again, this show does contain very optimistic underlying messages. It is relatable, especially for people who are in their 20s, 30s, and 40s. 
Moreover, what makes this show stand out is the acting of its cast, especially that of Bae Jung Woo and Jung Yu Mi, two of the most reliable actors in South Korean movie industry - Chungmunro. The soundtrack is awesome. The camerawork is good, too. All in all, this is one worth-watching show."
tt7976532,"I had been watching a lot of K-drama and comedy series on Netflix and this one popped up on my recommendation list. I started watching the first episode and while the acting was excellent, the episode was a little slow and I wasn't hooked. That changed rapidly towards the end of the first episode. I ended up binge watching the entire series over a few days, often giving up sleep so I could watch ""just a few minutes more"". When I was done, I went back and re-watched a couple of episodes. Then I went back and binge watched the entire series a second time. This show is simply that good. I didn't want it to end. The show follows the lives of the members of local police station as they deal with issues while on duty and in their everyday lives. The stories are very well developed and the acting is excellent. As the show progresses, the characters grow in depth and you find yourself becoming emotionally attached to them and caring about their outcomes. But be warned, there are some gut-wrenching moments in this show and there were several times I was brought to tears.As other reviewers have stated, this show needs a season 2."
tt7976532,"It's very difficult to explain all the things I felt watching this show. The cast here is impeccable. I've never watched a K-drama before, but ill say this. I'm seriously praying for a 2nd season. Superb acting. Superb script. Superb score. Best show I've ever seen. Huge thanks to the cast and creators. Thanks. Gracias. Much love."
tt7976532,"I laughed I cried and I cried again, I have watched many a Korean drama thanks to Netflix's so thank you for this drama it's just brilliant. Fingers and toes crossed they do another season PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE"
tt7976532,"Watched IRIS on NETFLIX, it was great. Now I'm watching 'LIVE' Korean police drama at its best. 18 episodes total, l'm on episode 15. 
Wish episode 1 would bore me to death, instead i'm hooked on this show. Great story comes great acting from cast members.
This is NOT spoiler alert, LIVE will make you laugh, feel sad and cry along with the show Hope there will be 'LIVE' season 2.
Great original soundtracks and lastly, I also wish that SUBTITLE can display a little longer on screen.
I am now big fan of Yu-mi Jung, don't tell my wife that."
tt7976532,"Live is a fantastic drama, which is equally devastating and inspiring to watch. This is a very realistic drama, and it doesn't hold back to show the brutal realities of the police force. The direction is incredible, the character development is compelling and the acting is amazing. The storytelling was excellent, the overarching plots & story arcs as well as episodic conflicts were well paced. This drama truly gives you a new perspective of life."
tt7976532,"Having seen Brooklyn 99, Rookie Blue, The Shield, Without a Trace and Chicago PD, I was hoping for something similar in this series. What made the above mentioned series great are their captivating crime mystery, in depth character arcs, carefully crafted plots.Live however, didnt delivery like any of them. Overall it is okay but can be way overly dramatic to the point of hysterics. Some of the police cases that comes up seems to be very similar to previous episode and repetitive. There seems to be a lack of creativity in the mystery of the crimes that they solve. As well there theme of having bad family upbringing seems to overly done and core of most characters problematic past. The element of blame-pushing is heavily focused on as the drama builder in each episode. The characters in the first half are done well to build the story, but becomes stale as well due to lack to real bonding between them.Worth checking out if you're curious of South Korean police and their methods. If you're seeking an ok drama to pass the time, this could be it. Otherwise, for those looking for great police dramas check out one of these: Brooklyn 99, Rookie Blue, The Shield, Without a Trace and Chicago PD.6.5/10."
tt7976532,"Writing from Canada and this Korean police drama just ticks all the boxes. I have laughed hysterically and even cried and I rarely cry watching films or TV. This series takes you through every emotion without even realising it until an episode is over just how much it affected you. The acting is superb as is the directing and filming. Most of the Korean shows I watch from Netflix are hits for me: a few getting a second viewing regardless of how many episodes there are. There is something about the way Koreans approach movie making that is so fantastic and ""Live"" is another example of it. I will not give out any spoilers but if you are a fan of a great TV series this is one to watch. I really hope there is another season.PS: I am not Korean...I am Deaf and will watch anything, from any country, as long as it has closed-captioning. :-)"
tt7976532,"I had seen this on my Netflix suggestions and ignored it, as I get a bit bored with cop shows in general. Then I saw a video on YouTube by a reviewerI rate, recommending it as an undervalued hit, so I took a look for myself. i'm so very glad I did.
Much like ""Search WWW"", the writers have allowed for the complexity of being a human to show through in the characterisations. No one is simply good or bad (at least of the main focus characters), and everyone is struggling to do the best they can with their individual situations. The acting was consistently strong across the board, and it was a nice commentary about how the public in the media can pile on about something they know very little truth about.
It's a salient reminder for us to always consider the wider implications of any situation we find people like the police in. Yes there are police who choose to make very bad decisions. But most of the time, most police are just trying to do their best to look out for the people in their community. It's easy to forget that when all we hear about are the extremes...."
tt7976532,"I was never much a fan of T.V dramas because of waiting until the next episode or season when a story line was not finished. Then I watched ""Live"" and my whole world was turned, the emotional roller coaster that this series brings to viewers, even an hardcore people, will be brought to tears. The cast did a great job of bringing there characters to life, which you must also commend the directors and producers. I'm not going to ruin it and tell you any spoilers, all I can say is that you really need to watch it, I really hope there's another season in the making. Make sure you stack up on the tissues, because It will make you laugh and will make you cry, believe it when I say it's worth your time."
tt7976532,"I sa this show on Netflix Australia and instantly was addicted. Live is captivating and all the cast, script and songs are amazing, i actually could watch the season all over again and not be bored. Korean shows have talented actors and I am watching these over English speaking shows, just because of the shows are so much better. I do hope that it gets picked up for a second season, I thought A Korean Odessy was great, but this show blows it out of the park."
tt7976532,"This series is so well written by picturing the Police's point of view as humans. They still have to face their personal issues,their fear,the public pressures while still have to do their job well to serve the community. Well done to the scripwriter,directors and all the actors. You guys did a great job!"
tt7976532,I'm finding S Korean made shows very refreshing. Also more realistic. This one did not disappoint. If only they would talk American. Ha Ha. The story is excellent. It was nice to see a show that didn't make cops look like bullies or idiots. They also did a good job on showing how today society treats it's hero's Like garbage that should be thrown out. I will watch more S Korean shows.
tt7976532,"It's a very good show want to see a lot more. A lot of story, not hard to fallow"
tt7976532,"I have watched this because of Lee Kwang Soo but ended up falling in love with all the casts. I felt every characters emotions. It touched my heart in every ways i don't even know possible. Highly recommended. If you're thinking if it's worth the watch.
It is.
IT. DEFINITELY. IS."
tt7976532,This show makes me cry a lot. Cases will happen in life. Police fights for people who got injured. It's really important that police officers know their responsibility and job. Love the show!
tt7976532,"This show will make you both laugh and cry and think about life throughout the various episodes and situations the characters go through!I was thoroughly entertained with each episode, and I kept wanting more whenever an episode ended. Now that I finished the show, I sure do wish we could get a second season!The cast did really well with their acting, especially the main characters; loved to see how they developed throughout the show to becoming stronger characters.The stories in-between the overall plot were also done well.The music and background tracks were few and I did notice them repeat a bit too much near the end since I've heard them a lot, and yes while they were really good it could be better with a slightly bigger variety of tracks.Definitely watch this show, you will have a blast!"
tt7976532,"This show is everything people are saying and so much more. It is beyond amazing in everyway. Wonderful acting, superb set and costume design, and great stories. The only thing i want more from this series is a season 2!"
tt7976532,A group of young cadets are assigned to their mentors at a city police station and this series is about the trials and tribulations they face. A well acted series with interesting stories showing the human side of the police force and also the circumstances which sometimes cause good people to commit crime. My only criticism would be the love story which taking into account the theme of many of the stories I found a little creepy as it gives the impression if the girl says she is not interested just hang in there and she will change her mind.
tt7976532,"I watched so many Korean drama especially detective one and I feel korean drama has too many romance scene that dragging on. However, when I watched this drama, I feel really engage in the life of the characters since they act so comfortably & naturally with each other. Some of the characters can be a bit awkward at some scene but that makes it more natural & engaging. I cried heaps watching each episode & the romance scene is so natural. It was really fun to watch Kwang soo expressions when doing a romance scene. This drama is so different than the others & I really love it!"
tt7976532,Almost everything was good in this drama. Especially mention to Lee Kwang Soo who did a fantastic job. His bromance with his senior was so heartwarming. I find only one drawback and that too with the female lead. Her overact and shallowness sometime irritates me.
tt7976532,Best drama ever. Best kwang soo act.Best story.Very2 emotional.
tt8714904,"I have to say that I really enjoyed Narcos: Mexico almost as much as the original. While not quite as good as the original Narcos, it's still a pretty good show that's definitely worth watching! It's about the rise of the Guadalajara cartel and the DEA chasing them and even helping in some cases. The writing and acting in this series is as good as any show you'll find in cartels. I was skeptical at first because Narcos was so good but was pleasantly surprised at how well this turned out too. It continues the story about the drug cartels and does such an amazing job at it. It's addicting once you start watching and even though like half of it is in Spanish, you'll get used to the subtitles pretty quick. I would recommend this to anyone who's interested in how the cartels work and what it takes to be at the top of the drug world."
tt8714904,"Even though Narcos: Mexico isn't as good as the original Narcos, it's still a pretty good show that's absolutely worth watching! I was skeptical at first because Narcos was so good but I was pleasantly surprised at how well this turned out too. It continues the story about the drug cartels and does such an amazing job at it. It's pretty addicting once you start watching and you get used to the subtitles pretty quick."
tt8714904,"As far as the show goes it's fantastic but what really stood out in my opinion was the performance of Joaquín Cosío as ""Don Neto"" I believe this is one of the best supporting performances in any Netflix series to date! The arc that he goes through and the performance that he turns in cannot be ignored. He is a very talented actor and displays this in every scene he's in! He is the most believeable character in the show shining brightly over an already brilliant cast of actors."
tt8714904,"Brings back some of the great pace, acting and dialogue that made the original Narcos so great"
tt8714904,"First two seasons were great. If you enjoy the genere, just watch them.In the third one, the narrator's voice is simply out of place. The journalist's storyline to which the voice belongs is also ludicrous and forced - another twenty something year old explaining the injustices of the world.Nobody needed another one of those.Very poor choice."
tt8714904,"I don't like glorifying and justifying crime and narcotics & I'm really glad Netflix showed the big picture.The rise of world's first known drug cartel,The Guadalajara Cartel. I ain't justifying Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo but thinking about something like that, The idea of system like cartel in 1980s is the most underrated thing in modern history and modern Economics with the background of Contra & Civil war. The rise of El jefe de jefes Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo,Rafael Caro Quintero & Don Neto with rise of infamous Guadalajara cartel. It showed basics of founding any empire, it's the entrepreneurship 101. From basic Supply and Demand to Rent,Wages, Interest,Profit to Risk bearing, Decision making, Effect of govt policies on business with the touch of cold war politics & bureaucratic fighting over jurisdiction. It's an economical classic. A classic story of how empire's are built & fallen,how genius ideas are putted into action,how a single wrong decision can destroy systems,how elections are rigged,how departmental politics screws individuals plans and how sometimes nice people becomes collateral damage for Agencies. Diego Luna portrayed Miguel Angel very lively. Perfect Manipulative,poker face, Strong dialogues with strong body language. Diego Luna deserves more appreciation for this role. Many people will compare him to Wagner Moura that's natural but honestly you can't compare Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo with Pablo Escobar. Even though they were in narcotics business there are not appropriate common grounds for comparison. I wish goodluck for 3rd season & I really hope to have Narcos : Afghanistan (no offense)!"
tt8714904,"If we say that this series is addictive like drugs, we don't say wrong. I'd say it's really compatible with the name of the show. It is very enjoyable to watch such a drug war in Mexico after Colombia. No one from the old cast. We see a new battle with a completely new cast. I think the idea of adapting the same issue to another country is good. After beginning with Pablo Escobar in Colombia, ""Narcos"" shifted to the Cali cartel, an equally colorful and bloodthirsty bunch. Now we see the Mexican drug lord Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo. Also named as El Padrino, Felix Gallardo is a citizen of El Chapo. Both of them are from Culiacan. Though the episodes are lengthy, it's a absorbing story. Historically we may know the outcome but Narcos: Mexico has an interesting story. Definitely worth watching. 9/10"
tt8714904,"Diego Luna's acting was top notch and I really hope he has further success in his career.
I guess I can say, he's one of a kind and *narcos mexico* now is easily my favorite of narcos series.
A huge *well done* to him and his crew."
tt8714904,"I really loved the first 3 seasons and while it was a little boring in places, I never felt like a was wasting my time.Narcos Mexico is all upside down, the narrator is mostly gone which leaves the viewer in the dark as to context. The main narco boss is a side character in his own story, I just didn't feel anything towards him like with Pablo and Cali brothers. Rafa dominates this series in a bad way, he's such an annoying pointless character. Half the scenes felt like they were filler . It was just boring.I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never did, which is surprising because a quick Google search will bring up loads of events this show decided to ignore in favour of conversations about the weather."
tt8714904,"'Narcos' told the story of the rise and fall of the Colombian cartels this, as the name suggests, does the same for Mexico. As the story starts a keen DEA agent, Kiki Camarena, gets a posting to Guadalajara in Mexico. At the same time Félix Gallardo, a cop turned marijuana producer from Sinaloa is moving his operation to Guadalajara along with his friend Rafa, who has produced a superior strain of the plant which needs to be grown away from other plants. Félix works to unite the various regional crime syndicates, the 'Plazas'. Inevitably his operations attract the attention of the DEA. There is frequent violence but nothing compared to the level after he decides to shift the operation to smuggling cocaine for the Colombians. Inevitably there are various power struggles and some arrests despite the corruption in the local police.The first two seasons only get us to 1989 so there is still a tragically large amount of the story to cover. I didn't know much about the events being shown so had little idea of which characters would survive. The story is gripping from start to finish; the way it intertwines the stories of the traffickers and their DEA opponents keeps things interesting. The characters, on both sides of the law, are interesting to watch and are depicted in a fairly non-judgemental way... their actions speak loudly enough without the need to make them more villainous. The cast does a great job bringing the various characters to life; most notably Diego Luna as Félix Gallardo; Michael Peña as Kiki Camarena; and Scoot McNairy as DEA Agent Walt Breslin. Given the subject matter it isn't surprising that there is a fair amount of violence, some of it quite shocking. As season two come to an end one chapter of the story clearly comes to an end but there is far more to tell; I look forward to future seasons."
tt8714904,"I really enjoyed Season 1 and 2. With season 3 it's almost like you're watching some kind of cheap replica and you're wondering if it is actually the same show. Some of the actors are familiar, some of the story seems familiar, but it's just not the same quality as the previous two seasons. The narration is bad, and the episodes in S3 are pretty unwatchable to be honest. It's really a great shame."
tt8714904,"It was a great show for the first two seasons; however, the season 3 tries too hard to make sense but ends up being bland.The characters are hollow and the plot itself is weak.Also, the reporter-narrator is plain cringeworthy and often has an obnoxious attitude/expressions to a point that makes the drug lords seem like polite gentlemen; could never take that character seriously and pulled my involvement."
tt8714904,"Just finished the second season. I'd imagine the ridiculously low scores come from the group of hate and misery - those people will never change, so ignore those.First season was great, the second season's plot was more defined and drawn out, so it may seem slow to begin with, but it'll keep you glued to the end. Great plot twists. You'll be happy. Watch it, and ignore the haters."
tt8714904,"Engaging and at times thought provoking amid all the gunfire.
I loved the look and feel of the series, the trashy culture and over the top lifestyles. I appreciated the artful use of swearing and the intro montage - a clever trail of cocaine powder on a map outlining the path of cocaine through Mexico. The music is inspired--including the insipid pop songs that accompanies some of the mayhem. You gotta love the track suits that some of the drug lords sport. The acting is top-notch and the grainy footage reminds us the story is vaguely based on real events."
tt8714904,The Narcos tales just keep getting more interesting. This is easily as high a standard as the other seasons. Thankyou to all the people making this exciting show.
tt8714904,"The whole Narco series is really good. This stand alone season, focusing on Mexico, is of the same quality. And old Colombian acquaintances from the mother series appear in a kind of double crossover halfway through the season.
Looking forward to the ""Narcos: Florida"" season. ;-)"
tt8714904,"(Review updated after Season 3).A dramatized history of the Mexican drug cartel.Essentially Seasons 4+ of Narcos. Time-wise, however, it initially precedes Season 1, hence it being a new, standalone series. It does tie in nicely with Narcos, especially once the links to the Columbian cartels are made. DEA agent Kiki Camerena, the main 'good guy' in Season 1, was also mentioned in Season 1, Episode 1 of Narcos, so this series backfills a story only briefly mentioned in Narcos.An excellent series, and a worthy addition to the Narcos stable. Quite interesting and intriguing - a good mix of history, drama, action and intrigue. Well-drawn and developed characters - even the bad guys have character depth, to the point that you're entirely engaged by their character.A great study in how power corrupts - you can see how some of the main characters in the cartel go from innocent small-time crooks to power-hungry, blood-thirsty thugs. Also shows how this contributes to the unravelling of the empire.Diego Luna is excellent as Gallardo and the performances are first-rate. As with Narcos, the fact that the dialogue is largely in Spanish adds a huge amount of authenticity to proceedings.Does take a while to become really engaging though. For the first four or so episodes it seems fairly tame compared to Narcos, largely due to being about marijuana rather than cocaine, and due to Gallardo not being a well-known, larger-than-life figure like Pablo Escobar. However, from Episode 5 or so the action, intrigue and machinations rachet up a few notches.The writing is also initially less tight than in Narcos, resulting in some contrived scenes. In addition, if you remember what was said about Kiki Camerena in Narcos, you know how this is going to play out for him. This limits some of the intrigue in Season 1.After the excellent set-up in Season 1, Season 2 is a great follow-up. Not quite as well-paced as S1, as it tackles several sub-plots simultaneously and sometimes gets bogged down in one or two. It seems to progress in fits and starts. However, it is very intriguing and compelling and the occasional lack of momentum is not that noticeable.Season 3 is where the series hits its stride. By now the focus has shifted to a different set of characters, characters who were present in previous seasons but were largely secondary. In particular we have Amado who was always one of my favourite supporting characters in the previous seasons and here turns out to be quite the likeable villain. José María Yazpik gives an excellent performance as Amado and contributes greatly to the success of Season 3.In addition to higher character engagement levels the writing here is also tighter, with some great intrigue and machinations in the war between the cartels and between them and the DEA.This season also sees the Mexican chronology catch up with the Colombian one, effectively joining the two series together.In keeping with this convergence, Season 3 is superb and is of the same quality as the original Narcos.Season 1: 9/10. Season 2: 8/10. Season 3: 10/10."
tt8714904,"I found that Kiki Macarena was overdoing it - as if it was HIS mission to save the US from drugs. It was a bit cringe to be honest, I just wanted to say to him, you have a wife and kids, your wife is pregnant, go home and look after them instead of trying to be a hero.The final season was ruined by the female voice over - journalist.... I just didn't understand the point in that other than giving a female a main role.... All the females in the series so far had been brilliant but the journalist was just annoying and her Mexican accent when speaking English unbearable.Season 3 of Mexico was not as good but I dare say the first 2 seasons were at least as good as the first 2 seasons of Colombia (season 3 was not as good)It is a shame they have decided to cancel the show but I am certain the loss of interest in the final season was partly caused by that annoying voice over."
tt8714904,"I'm halfway in and I'm having trouble understanding all the rave reviews about this season. Narcos: Mexico comes across as rather slow, uninspired and playing it safe on the drama part. Perhaps it's gonna accelerate into something interesting soon, I really hope so. But for now, I'm having trouble finishing episodes without getting distracted by more interesting things.It basically suffers from the same malady most anthology series do: it really doesn't offer anything other than more of the same. The compelling characters from the first three seasons are gone, and I'm having much trouble letting the new ones grow. It seems the series has become lazy, assuming we're gonna be shackled to our screens because... it takes place in Mexico?Another difference is the sparse use of voice-over. For me, this was one of the most compelling elements of the previous seasons, letting seasons 1 and 2 sometimes border on docudrama, and that really was a good thing. Now, the narrator is just a voice, not an important character as well, while this used to be an outstanding feature of Narcos.I'm gonna give it a chance until the end, but for now, the fourth season has lost its luster to me."
tt8714904,"I thought narcos will die by the end of narcos colombia 🇨🇴 But omg i was wrong!
Its a great serie and l hobe to see a second season"
tt8714904,"Season two on Narcos Mexico is as great as the first two season of Narcos (Escobar) .
perfect from all aspects.."
tt8714904,"This used to be one of my top 5 shows but this season idk, it's dragging and I honestly can't take this narrator seriously. Her voice is grating. Why change from the DEA agent narrating? He was perfect and so much more effective in story telling, realistic.I'm having a hard time with this final season, such a bummer. Maybe she'll shut up and the last few episodes will save it, only a few more to go though.."
tt8714904,I liked season 1 and 2 but season 3 is really bad and hard to watch. The horrible horrible actress who was selected as a journalist and a narrator in season 3 literally shat on everyone's hard work in the previous seasons. Her body language and acting is so weird and annoying and just hard to watch. Her narration is so pathetic and her pronunciation is so bad and not clear or engaging enough. It's unfair to the other actors who had put in so much hard work and time in season 1 & 2 to cast such horrible actors to continue the storyline. It's unfair to the audience as well. Overall the story line is bad and very boring. All the new actors are very mediocre especially victor and that journalist/narrator andrea are the worst. Just her appearance on screen itself made me so mad. So angry and disappointed because i had liked season 1 & 2.
tt8714904,"Well written, realistic, stories that are well-picked for good dramatization. very typical choice of approach for real life event storytelling. good guy trying to catch the bad guy, however both are portrayed with such detail and both are represented by such skilled actors they both become very likable characters determined and strong willed. hard to believe that story about such a violent criminal enterprise like narcos can be such a delightful experience to watch."
tt8688814,"My whole family (kids ages 12, 9 & 7 & 2 adults) really enjoys watching this show together! The characters are well done. The dialogue is witty and funny. The story is very compelling! We hope more seasons come out Very Soon!
The kids tell me to add that the little creature named Bait is the best!"
tt8688814,If You are a fan of the avatar series the dragon Prince is a perfect spiritual successor to watch on netflix.
tt8688814,"This show is like the sphinx, or like the leaning tower of Pisa. 99% perfect. The flaws add to the perfection. There are no bad guys. Rayla, Ezran, and Callum, may be the protagonists, but Viren, Claudia and Soren are hardly despicable bad guys. In fact, they have qualities we can agree with. There are no bad guys. Just politically juxtaposed ideals and steadfastness in their stances. This show is basically just as good, maybe better than Game of Thrones. It's a family friendly version. These characters are magnetic, substantial. Every character has redeeming qualities we can relate to. 100% certified fresh? I fully agree. This show is a must watch for everyone"
tt8688814,"Our family began watching this for the kids but then the parents are watching without the kids! We all love it. Very well written script. Simple, real characters. Neat twists. I'm invested in these guys, I wanna see how it goes for them! That's what a good show is made of. Add a Scottish accent and I'm hooked! Check it out!!"
tt8688814,"Despite technically being considered an adult, I still Rewatch avatar: the last airbender and the legend of korra pretty regularly. Those shows, as well as the Dragon Prince I believe are very important as they allow children to watch a tv show that has just as much heart and love put into it as any adult television. Shows like these allow children, as well as others to watch a show that doesn't dumb down its subject matter or lore. Shows like these give kids the oputunity to watch non serialized tales that teach life lessons. I've watched the first few episodes and it shows nuances unlike anything seen in children's television. It is perfect for adults who are sick of watching spongebob squarepants with their children. It is very entertaining as well as well-written and facinating. It is perfect for anyone at any age and would highly recommend."
tt8688814,This show is absolutely fantastic if you're a fan of Avatar the last Airbender or even just a fan of fantasy this is the perfect show for you the story is in depth the characters are great and it's all so well paced you'll be wanted more after every season watched. Highly recommended!!
tt8688814,"At the time of writing, Wonderstorm has just released season 3. So far, this show is one of the most captivating and inspiring stories that I have seen in my generation, animated or not. The animation style originally proved to be a hurdle, but the second season smoothed it out. After every season release I have been in awe at the masterful writing this show displays in it's enthralling plot line, authentic character development, and beautiful moral driving everything. Most notably is the constant ethical balance the characters keep in their stance on how the world should change. I have never seen a show that so vividly protrays important moral concepts like self justification, stereotyping, and ambiguity while keeping the wholesome and light hearted nature of the writing style. This is a story that deserves to be told, and personally brings back feelings of the first time I read Tolken's 'The Lord of the Rings'."
tt8688814,I was hoping this would be a good show and I am happy to say that it is. It has an interesting story and great characters. Most complaints I read here were about the animation which didn't bother me. The animation gets smoother in season 2 and I'm also happy that the story didn't lose its momentum in season 2 but actually gets even more interesting . I highly recommend this series.
tt8688814,"This is specifically a review for Season 2, and not Season 1. If you are new to this show, I would recommend reading Season 1 reviews as they may be more useful to you.While I won't go into any specific details to avoid spoilers, I will simply say that Season 2 is fantastic, and a real pleasure to experience. If you enjoyed Season 1, or even thought Season 1 was ""pretty good but nothing special"", you have to see Season 2. It is truly amazing. Everything was just incredible, the art, the backgrounds, the music, the fight scenes were INCREDIBLY good and high quality, the story was amazingly well rounded with tons of development, backstory, and mysteries still left to unveil.But most importantly, the true beauty of the show really shined again this Season, and that was the characters. The dialogue is just superb. I particularly love Soren's character, and just how much life he breathes into every scene he's in. All the new characters are fantastic, and one of them in particular has a voice of GOLD (you'll know what I mean when you watch the season). I wouldn't go through every character that were great because truly they all were, but Callum, Rayla, Ezren, Claudia and Soren had some fantastic scenes in this season.The animation has gotten so much better, it is very smooth and flows very very well. While I never had a problem with Season 1's animation, if that ever bugged you, this newer Season has completely removed all of the stuttering and frame problems.Now what are you still doing here? GO WATCH SEASON 2 ALREADY"
tt8688814,"Took 2+- Years and its only ground for the new seasons, i understand this is important but man why the whole season!And its not just that, i cant feel the same way with the characters because they act out of character. This season was so desperate to have a actionful last episodes they messed up.I still believe in the series, but dont go into with too much expectations.Season 5 hopefully will be on at july 2023, i hope they make a banger last 3 seasons because they sacraficed a whole season and 2 years for this.For the previous 3 seasons my review is 8.3 average.Even tho this season is murdered you should check this one out!"
tt8688814,"While I miss the Last Airbender/Legend of Korra franchise, this is a really good show for all ages. The characters are very well created, the story develops pretty well, the humor can be pretty funny, and all in all a great adventure. The new animation style is pretty cool, and there were some times that I did see the old style of the writer's work in the characters expressions and dialogue."
tt8688814,"Tl;dr
8/10 for the first 3 seasons. After that the show nosedives.Full review.""The Dragon Prince"" started with great promise in its initial three seasons. These early episodes showcased a rich, engaging world filled with intriguing characters and a compelling plot. The animation style was unique, blending traditional 2D character design with 3D environments, creating a visually stunning experience. The story, centered around two human princes and an elf assassin, was both engaging and emotionally resonant, dealing with themes of war, peace, and understanding. There was humor and flashes of great writing.However, the show's quality took a noticeable downturn starting from Season 4. The writing, once sharp and nuanced, became increasingly lackluster. Plotlines that were carefully built in the first three seasons seemed to unravel, losing the depth and complexity that initially made the show appealing. Characters, once richly developed, started to feel one-dimensional, and their decisions and growth no longer felt organic.Season 5 continued this disappointing trend. The narrative, which had been tightly woven in the earlier seasons, felt disjointed and rushed. Key story arcs were resolved in unsatisfying ways, and new plotlines introduced felt superficial and unengaging. It seemed as if the show had lost sight of what made it special in the first place.In summary, while the first three seasons of ""The Dragon Prince"" are definitely worth watching for their storytelling, character development, and unique animation style, the subsequent seasons fail to live up to the high standards set by their predecessors. Seasons 4 and 5 suffer from poor writing and storytelling, making them less enjoyable and, unfortunately, not worth the time for fans who cherished the show's initial excellence."
tt8688814,"So my rating is 6 because S1-S3 were 8. Total of 24 divided by 4 cause season 4 is 0 point. I stopped at 2nd episode cause1. It's already loaded with agenda. And its an animation where it was supposed to be for kids. The rating is 18+ now. And everyone gets an elf boyfriend/girlfriend. They were sworn enemies for ages!!2. The characters are all dumbed down. For example soren was stupid but quite funny now he's just annoyingly stupid.3. Lots of unnecesary dialogue. Like ""i love books!!"" ""Yes books are awesome!."" Wtf?4. And they change the animation style, it was from like you know avatar of Aang style, now it's more like 3dimension which in my opinion it made it worse."
tt8688814,"I honestly didn't know it was created by the makers of Last Airbender until I finished the first season (though I recognized Sokka's voice actor and the book one intro should've been a clue) and I don't care to compare it to AtLA. Its an amazing show on its own! Diverse characters, character development, intrigue, humor, heart warming moments, and 8 even teared up. Is it perfect? No but it doesn't have to be. This is my new favorite show, as I'm sure it is for a lot of people. Really excited to see season 2!"
tt8688814,"I absolutely loved this series. Wish it was longer but a lot developed in the 9 episodes. I would've given a 10 but the animation is a bit off. It seems like a really cheap and lazy form of animation. It felt like i was watching a bunch of stills from a book with no movement. Not a fan of outlining everything. Despite this which is just a personal preference i loved the show. Good character development and great story. Very similiar to Avatar the last airbender, which is still one of the best cartoons ever. Callum reminds me a lot like Sokka. Overall worth watching cant wait for season 2."
tt8688814,"I was skeptical when I saw this announced and heard it was from Avatar creators. While The Last Airbender was a good show, I didn't want to see that recreated with dragons slapped on the label. While the show initially irked me by following the same ""Book/Chapter"" format to the seasons and titles along with having elemental sources of power, I was happily refreshed by how original everything else was. While there are design elements I don't necessarily like, all of the characters so far are so unique and unexpected. Who thinks to animate a mute warrior and have them use sign language in a cartoon? And it really works. Overall I really like the story and want to see more. And I, for one, enjoy the animation style. It draws me back to Dragon Booster and I love it."
tt8688814,"I did se season one in one go. And it did not feel long. Good characters, good story, beautiful artwork. Yes, I did see the Last Airbinder/Korra references. Yes, it was made for young people. But for one who graded up to level 60, I do relax and enjoy this kind of TV shows of this quality. A light in a dark world. Yes I do dream of dragons, ever since Anne McCaffrey Dragon riders of Pern. Well done, you lot."
tt8688814,"The Dragon Prince is awesome. It has a highly entertaining story, clever humor, interesting characters, and tons of beautiful art. It also takes cues from some of the best elements in Avatar: the Last Airbender, and manages to make them feel fresh and uniquely its own (e.g. different types of magic compared to different types of bending).The animation looks great as well. I'll admit, I was a bit skeptical of the 3D art style at first, but after the first episode, I was already used to it and ended up really liking it!The lore and setting of The Dragon Prince has much to offer as well. Featuring a medieval setting with magic, knights, assassins, and, of course, dragons! There's so much to enjoy in The Dragon Prince. If you're looking for an engaging show with great lore and great characters (as well as a similar feel and good writing like Avatar: the Last Airbender) then The Dragon Prince is for you."
tt8688814,"The firstthree seasons of this series have it all, adventure, humor, pathos. There is something about the characters as drawn and voiced that really works. I love that the show is diversity friendly. I enjoyed the critique of human greed and constant need for a kind of techno power. I felt the plot line was enjoyable and restorative. I re-watched the series more than once. Was and am an eager fan.It seems that something that was natural and easy, became over thought in season 4. I found season 4 very hard to watch. Something that was really working in season 1-3, was turned off in season 4. It is a shame. Season 4 (mystery of avvaros) took over the name of the series in many renditions. I think that is a shame also."
tt8688814,"It's fun. Good story, world building and characters. I like the music, the humor is decent and the voice acting is good as well. While the animation looks ok as far as the art style goes (it's kinda cell shaded and lacks fine details but has a nice color pallet and basic conept) the frame rate is abysmally low. It's really obvious and its jarring. The action is decent but at these frame rates fast/quick motion in in the action scenes is clunky and jarring. Even in normal conversation the characters look robotic. They can hardly get the mouths to match the voices properly because the frame rate is so bad. It all just looks off. Its a real shame to because there is definitely something here, but it's hard to watch because they didnt throw enough money into animating enough frames to do it justice"
tt8688814,I didnt really know what the show was but I started watching it and got hooked on it. It definitely got me emotionally attached to each character and they all have a crucial part In the show. The show is very funny its clever and keeps you on your toes. I always want to know what will happen next.
tt8688814,"Good: love the art, some nice jokes.not so good:
not really original. dragon, magic, divided nations, adventure with misfits for greater cause. not convincing acting, everything is a joke and some part are really boring, the pace is not doing it for me and just not a lot of feel to it. I found myself not really into any of the characters till the end.don't hate me for this, first season is just ok. was forcing myself to finish it halfway into the season, it doesn't really get more interesting for me, so not motivated to continue. If you are looking for a more mature and grim type of fantasy cartoon, this is not for you. Don't go in with high expectations despite the serious build up from the first 2 episodes, it is a feel good type of show."
tt8893550,It's refreshing to see 'reality tv' be fully entertaining without the need for unnessesary drama or fighting umongst cast members.Season 2 needs to happen!
tt8893550,Love the cast! The cars are great! But unfortunately you don't get to see what was really put into the cars ;( There are so many unique Gotham custom details put into the cars that you don't get to see on the show. Would love to see more of the work and thought that went into them.
tt8893550,"I'm not sure if the people on the show just suck at fiberglass work and are lazy on certain things but damn. The body work on the concept bike is so raggedy and rough on all the edges, no smooth transitions. The international had bed liner that wasn't sprayed clean, the f1 had a rusty underside of the hood. For the money people pay it's insane that they don't have better finishes."
tt8893550,"Just finished watching binge watching the series. Believe it or not, I started thinking if there will be a season 2 at the end of the 2nd episode. The crew and the show as a whole are simply awesome. I'm already subscribed to Netflix but if I wasn't, I would probably subscribe just so that I could watch this show. Please let there be a season 2."
tt8893550,"Great series, I watched the whole thing in less than a day and enjoyed it all with my kids who are only ages 9 & 10. My youngest who likes watching doco's says that Gotham Garage is far better and superior to West Coast Customs & I couldnt agree more. Would you please make a season 2! That Futura & hot wheels car was the best thing I've seen since a long time. Cheers guys keep up the good work y'all. 😎👍"
tt8893550,"Great cars, great workers & great relationships! Wish I had found this show later on & with 3 seasons or more because I could binge watch this for days if not weeks."
tt8893550,"I absolutely believe it is long overdue that Net Flix did put a car show on & this is a very good choice.
Admittedly I am on episode 5 but am already finding the choice of cars to do customisation to be very interesting with a 64 Thunderbird cross between space ship & bat car,the VW & the 1st & only time I have seen truck grey in color I like.
Just starting out but with more shows this garage like Gas M could really make a hit in the higher end American cars but still with the $500 to $1,000 start cars for trading.
 Like the crew mix & was not surprised when I found the page for this show the singular pic is of Constance Nunes the definate winner of gorgeous real mechanic.
Season 2 please & knock all the Korean,Chinese tv show garbage on the head."
tt8893550,"Netflix you have out done yourselves with this show! I love it, I the show is such a fun show to watch that keeps you on your feet and wanting more. You simply want to binge watch all the episodes especially being that entertaining. Please make a season 2 for all of us that want one."
tt8893550,"Its always cool to see junkers turned into gold! These guys are turning out some bada$$ rides! The chemistry of the crew is good they really seem to like each other. Constance can turn a wrench just as well as any other grease monkey she's not just a pretty face, she is a solid 10 though!"
tt8893550,"This is a great show to watch with the family. We had a great time trying to pick all the failures in execution, the shoddy work and the creative editing to try to hide as much as possible."
tt8893550,We love cars in this household so when my kids found this we were all very pleased!
tt8893550,"I enjoy the show but on every car I see them do, there are workmanship issues. The canopies don't fit tightly on the 2 cars they built that have them. Almost every car I see them turn out, their engine compartments aren't finished and actually dirty, I've seen blemishes on finished paint or just poor paint in general, the Delahay is really sloppy; poor paint, front fender overlapping the rear, the rubber mat covering the running board fits poorly and had a big wrinkle in it, lots of body fitment issues...etc, etc. I could go on and on.Also, the relationship between the boss and Shawn feels uncomfortable. I guess we're supposed to think he's joking around with Shawn but he's always serious when he says derogatory things to him and there is NEVER any relief from it. You would never know he's joking. It truly seems like he doesn't like Shawn. It's uncomfortable and personally I don't like it. So as much as I like unique build shows, this one has things I can't overlook.I do like that the attractive woman they chose to cast (Constance) actually has a legitimate background and skill set. Congratulations for that."
tt8893550,"I get that the drama is capturing but I don't get it. The cars that they build aren't that good. The paint jobs and body work is very low quality. The few times the camera slows down in a close up you can see how bad the work really is. I can't see how they can sell for the prices they do, are the buyers just buying a chance for some tv exposure? It can't be the cars... Or? What´s the deal?"
tt8893550,I have a few queries though -Is this a actual business? Is Constance an actual worker or there to add eye candy?I feel there time frames are not believable at all ?
tt8893550,"I love car shows. All the work done in the garage so far is amazing (Fleetside!). It's nice to see a garage that doesn't come up with ridiculous ideas or cars/trucks that really serve no function other than being just a conversation piece. Really hoping there will be a season 2, get on it Netflix!"
tt8893550,Like I said best show! They make then most unique and badass stuff! Never seen anything like it! Second season please!
tt8893550,"Best car build series on netflix. absolutely love it and really praying for more seasons to come. I loved season 2! I was so dissappointed that there weren't anymore episodes.. Really looking forward to a season 3, 4, 5 and hopefully many more!!!
giel - from the netherlands"
tt8893550,"Wish there were more episodes. Like the concept of buying cheap, the trading and the payout. All of the builders mesh."
tt8893550,I finished watching this show on Netflix and We need a season 2 for this awesome show!!!!
tt8893550,My husband and I seldom find a series we can watch together and both of us enjoy it. This show kept both of us wanting to see the rest! The crew's interaction with each other was entertaining and all of their skills in the builds were very impressive!
tt8893550,"One more car show, more cozy and friendly than West Coast Customs. The people feel more honest and their behavior is sincere, plus you dont get to have to stand the annoying personality and cocky behaviour of the WCC Ceo just to see a few good rides.Cars shown are decent, but would definately appreciate more time showing the craftmanship and less time explaining the business model over and over again.Easy watch overall."
tt8893550,"Since the beginning of the Car Shows, studios have always been looking for a sure-fire-formula to make to keep the ratings up and the show going. If you want to have a car show these days you need to do the following:
1. Use the words ""baddass, interwebs, and Pop (for paint design)"" every 10th sentence.
2. Have impossible deadlines to get a car prepped, painted/built for a car event.
3. Magically have the car go from junk to a jewel in a week.
4. Have amazing ""barn find"" cars suddenly become discovered.
5. Sell a car that you wouldn't think get over $50K suddenly get $90.
6. Constantly talk about how whatever car you are building is the biggest, baddest, most expensive, risky, innovative, potentially bankrupting car ever.
7. A TON of IMDB reviews with incredibly high scores that just have a couple of sentences like...""its great"" or ""good show"".So Car Masters has all of these items....so what makes it different?1. Interesting cast of characters:
A: ""Surfer dude"" deal maker guy. He doesn't really work on cars..he just magically finds people who want to trade something for a Gotham Garage car...plus cash. Oh, and if you haven't figured out why he talks that way, He's an actor (duh..obviously....check his IMDB). B: Outrageous mechanic named ""caveman"" who hasn't cut his hair and beard since the stone age. C: Lone background Mechanic who looks like he puts in a hard days work named Tony. D: An incredibly hot chick model who works on cars. Is she an engine specialist? I guess so. Seems like she knows a few things about cars. And finally D: the head-bandana wearing boss (thats been done before) who I can never tell if he is happy, sad, angry, or whatever because he never changes expression or tone of voice throughout the entire show.2. The ""trade up"" system. In the show, the Gotham Garage gang build a car and then trade it to a customer who has something more valuable that they can use to increase their cash to get something bigger/better. Some how all the customers seem to weirdly accept these vehicles despite the tacky design or paint jobs.Look, I like car shows, but this one is sooooo heavily scripted and fake that it really makes the show look bad. Check for the supposed ""all-nighter"" scene where they are fake yawning and drinking coffee. Oh please....
Netflix...you missed the point of the car show. Its the BUILDING process we want to see. Not the drama. The fact that some of the work they do is questionable (big gap in the Futura sliding plexiglass cover that would fly off down the highway) and nobody wears safety gear kinda makes you wonder if this is a legit garage. Netflix...try again...but do it right ok?"
tt8893550,"Great crew with good chemistry, funny, passionate, and badass cars"
tt8893550,"I've watched a lot of car shows and this one is definitely above the pack. The crew is engaging while managing to avoid the over dramatization found in most reality shows. You can tell that they really enjoy working with each other. Having Constance on this show is definitely a plus, but I have to give props to Sean and Caveman for giving the show a broader audience appeal. Even my friends who don't particularly like car shows found their interactions with the rest of the crew entertaining and a welcome pause in between ""car talk""."
tt8893550,"I love cars, petrolhead since always and there's no other series that hooked me from the first minute to the end like this one. Waiting for a 1000 more episodes. Love it."
tt8080054,"The show was good. If you enjoyed hasan's homecoming special, you will enjoy this too. The presentation style is similar, but here he comments on current events (often niche, that other shows have not picked up on) ."
tt8080054,"It was always clear in Hasan Minhaj's appearances on The Daily Show, in his comedy specials and even in interviews that he has a certain vision and a message that he means to send.
It always seemed like he cared about informing viewers in different aspects of politics, immigrant culture, etc. in the funniest way possible
This show is just that but with a bigger budget and more screen time. If you enjoyed his work before, you'll LOVE this. If you didn't, check it out anyway, what do you have to lose."
tt8080054,This show deals with Hasan trying to spread awareness about the social issues and how they're impacting the common man.
tt8080054,It's Great. - Asian Dad. I am an Asian dad and I approve of this show.
tt8080054,"I didn't know what to expect but ran out of shows to watch and came across this. I'm surprised by how low some of the ratings are.You can tell the guy really cited his sources and looked into all sides. He makes it interesting to listen to him while discussing relevant issues,I enjoyed it and also learned something along the way hence my 10 stars."
tt8080054,"Been watching him since his college days on YouTube about a decade ago. Couldn't be more proud that he has his own show on Netflix. He has worked hard for this and was funny every step of the way. If you liked his material on The Daily Show, the '17 correspondents dinner, or his standup tour, then you'll like Patriot Act. People are going to compare him to John Oliver, complain that he's too political, he's not original, or about the use of his hands (I see you 1 star review). But let's be real: he brings his own perspective and presents the facts in a time where blatant lies are alternative facts. Can't wait for next week's episode."
tt8080054,"This show takes the best of the Daily Show and Last week tonight, and puts it into 30 minutes of HILARIOUS info. Keep it up!"
tt8080054,Mr Minhaj takes us on enlightened journeys in both a fun and educational way. Highly watchable!! Looking forward to 2019.
tt8080054,Its a replica of John Oliver's - Last week tonight. Its still a pretty good watch.
tt8080054,"It is scary how much talent that the Daily Show continues to churn up, although Hasan Minhaj seems like a comedic star that was meant to shine regardless!
Like Hasan's own comedy (See Homecoming and the 2017 WHC Dinner) this show looks at issues beyond the unidimensional American perspective and includes very funny jokes that you sometimes have to Google to understand (Ex: Gandhi in South Africa); which is to say, it seeks to educate as much as it seeks to entertain, and it succeeds at both.Patriot Act is as smart as it is funny, even when it deals with complicated topics, like the relationship of the US and Saudi Arabia and oil.
Parallels with Last Week Tonight are inescapable, as it is about the same format really. But the distinction in the generational appeal is obvious, because the jokes in Patriot Act hark back to the wild world of the 1990s!I hope this show sticks around for years, because it is another political comedy show that for some reason, treats political and cultural topics with the depth that mainstream media can't seem to come close to."
tt8080054,"Hasan Minhaj ...I'm speechless. Patriot Act is refreshing, logical, open, and smart. I don't have cable so I'm not familiar with John Oliver but I've seen clips of Oliver. They're both smart and funny and call BS when they see it...perhaps thats the correlation. Anyway Hasan is doing more of a Ted Talk platform. He keeps you engaged. I feel like I walked about feeling more curious about the world. He's right up there with comedians like Colbert, Oliver and Stewart, who can smartly shine light on political issues."
tt8080054,"Intellectually stimulating, funny, and entertaining. It's a new perspective on matters we already hear about on the news. Very well researched topics. The host and the writers are doing an amazing job. The show has credibility and I?m hooked :)."
tt8080054,"The show is nice and we do understand that the comedians make their money by scandalising certain issues, which to me is okay as well.
However, some of the information presented in the show is pretty biased and based on perspectives, stand alone news clips ( without the whole picture presented) and a critical opinion of the host.If this all was done for the sake of comedy and everything was made fun of, it would be amazing. However, what disturbed me was the seriousness associated with some of the allegations that felt like a critique than comedy.I hope comedy stays pure enough to avoid any politicians entering it. He have enough news channels that do such kind of comedy, don't need more."
tt8080054,"A political show that has positioned itself on the far left of the spectrum, hence the young age of the audience (college students, high school students and teenagers).The writing on Patriot Act is not bad, it's visuals are good and Hasan manages to entertain the audience by questioning right-wing politics with humor, but then, when it comes to the idiocy of the left, he makes up arguments centered around ethics, morals and guilt to justify those policies and idiologies, and completely leaves common sense and facts out of the conversation.Patriot Act had potential, but ended up being another show that feels like ideological brainwashing."
tt8080054,"This show is amazing, I love the way Hasan moves from subjects inside the same topic and the pace is just fantastic. Great blend between solid opinions and sarcastic jokes. The topics of each episode are very fresh and up to date. No doubt it's one of the best shows nowadays."
tt8080054,"Love Patriot Act! Great job to all of those involved in creating a well thought out, woke, honest and entertaining show!"
tt8080054,It's the best show I've seen in a long time. Very informative and a very good format.
tt8080054,"This show is just amazing! Hands down Hasan Minhaj is smart even though he said otherwise, he is witty even through so many political and hard news information or data that he delivers. I enjoy every minute and every episode. Couldn't wait for the next one!"
tt8080054,Hassan minhaj keeps the viewer well informed and entertained as he reveals the truth behind so many well hidden agendas. Wonder why the mainstream news channels don't cover any of these things..Finally someone who just tells it like it is on a big platform!!!
tt8080054,"This show feels very much like a labor of love for Minhaj, mixing political satire with a dash of stand-up, making for an absolute innovative treat of a show marinated with an Asian-Muslim flare that can only make for a more inclusive experience for viewers. A home run for Netflix for picking it up."
tt8080054,"I was sceptic, to episodes in I felt like it might be a bit much, but god damn this is a good show. It is entertaining, informative and just the right amount of provocative. Hasan Minhaj would be a fantastic host for other shows, and he crushes this one. He does exactly what he intends to do, and he does it really well. Even if you do not need to watch it for the news-content, it is a hilarious show."
tt8080054,"The show is amazing. It's smart, funny, disturbing and critical. Hasan Minaj is absolutely fantastic.
Now.. WHY? Why do you add this absolutely ridiculous canned laughter to the show? If a joke works, it works.. if it blows.. it blows. We are adults and we live in 2018, not 1970.
PLEASE drop the laugh track.. if you can't make it without the artificial laugh.. you'll probably not going to make it to the next season.. and that would be such a shame, because the show is really good."
tt8080054,"This show is Netflix's attempt at cookie cutting the successful John Oliver show on HBO. It's not entirely awful though, but I feel like it needs to work harder on an identity unique to the host Hasan Minhaj.
-And what's with the constant camera changes during his monologue? It's so clunky."
tt8080054,"Minaj feels mocking anyone whose ideology he doesn't personally agree with makes for good comedy. It should, but doesn't in this case."
tt8080054,"I enjoyed the show, and I loved how he educated us about politics by using comedy."
tt8750956,"I became interested in South Korean film and television a couple of years back and I'm so glad. They have an excellent array of motion picture and television offerings. They also have some great directors, actors, and actresses as good as any in the English speaking world. This program introduces talented and beautiful actresses in every episode. Many of them aren't even credited here in IMDb although a little searching can confirm they are well known. I've been surprised to see some really great performers without even pictures, and some with not even a bio. Please do us all a favor and correct that."
tt8750956,"Among the vast and rich human resources, we have one that allows us to learn and improve: the art of storytelling.
Before the times of documentation of history, were the stories about knights, warriors and their exploits that gave us the possibility to believe, grow and create. Entire civilizations were armed according to their needs, the majority based on beliefs, superstitions and myths.
And between reality and legend there is always fantasy extolling every feat. The epic and the glory encouraging us to be brave. Punishment or redemption marking the path to good or evil.
That's what this series is about. Comparable to others because it also represents various epic fantasies. But unique in its class because in the process each story, each villain and each hero possess the original and unique voice of the narrator.
Face this experience without prejudice. You won't be disappointed!"
tt8750956,This can't be it.... This drama is so good to just cut. I love that's it's not your usual kdrama. I love how they build the characters. I'm changing my ratings to 10 if you give us satisfying ending. Please!!!! 😁
tt8750956,"When you think of a Korean drama, you'd think of a modern love story in which characters are drawn closer in the face of conflict. This production is a daring, and likely expensive, leap into uniqueness that goes far beyond the typical romance. The vibes felt in Avatar, Narnia, and Harry Potter films are also felt throughout the episodes that make this show a cinematic experience you'd never wish would end.
The reviews don't do justice to this beautifully put together show; I had expected at least a 9/10 if not higher.Some critiques argue that the lengthy episodes make the story progression rather slow. However, any great tale that keeps us on our toes are those that invest time to connect with the characters (this may be why original novels tend to be superior to their movie counterparts). Critical comparisons made with Game of Thrones may as well be beyond my understanding; this drama holds its own essence.
Irking our curiosities of primitive life and a plot that pulls on your heartstrings. The actors and entire production crew couldn't have done a better job. This show is more than about romance; its about friendship, commitment, respecting mother nature (yes, like in Avatar), and believing in yourself. I highly suggest you finish all your errands before watching the first, 1.3 hr episode. Believe me, you'll find yourself clicking to the next."
tt8750956,"I found out and became interested in this series after I stumbled upon an article accusing this series to be a Korean GOT copycat. I watch it in Netflix. The first episode is kinda convoluted. Viewers were thrown into the midst without any guide or explanation to the background behind the setting of the story. This probably contributed to it's low rating.But as the season goes on, the story line become apparent and it starting to become interesting. The article cited the props and clothing as the indication that Arthdal Chronicles is a copy of GOT. But this like saying that Brooklyn Nine Nine is a copy of Law and Order because they both have guns and Police uniform. Nothing can be further from the truth.Unlike high medieval settings of the GOT, Arthdal Chronicles was set during the early bronze age and the time when human race starting to emerge from a tribal society into an early form of nation state. More importantly, there's no dragon in Arthdal, at least not so far."
tt8750956,"I was one of the lucky ones that found this when all the episodes were out. After watching the first few episodes my life the past week was literally work then home and watching Arthdal Chronicles. The more episodes i watched the more i did not want it to end and the closer i got to the last episode the more i was dreading the end was coming and now it's finished i can not stop thinking about it especially with the way it ends you got to be sure there's plans for another season. I have been recommending this show to anyone and everyone i know and have not done that since the early days of GoT. Speaking of GoT, saying it's a copycat could not be further from the truth, Arthdal Chronicles is unique and while watching it not once did GoT cross my mind. I not only hope they come out with a season 2 but a season 3, 4 and 5 !!"
tt8750956,"Offering stunning cinematography with a captivating story to tell, this is a must see, currently streaming on Netflix. This is no GOT to which some critics have compared it. Unless a series came out in the 1930's, then most everything has been put to film before and anything new draws some of their parts on something that's already been done. That being said, I don't see the comparison to GOT. This series stands on its own merits. I binge watched the first season and await more."
tt8750956,The last 5 episodes of season 1 gave me goosebumps... The production and direction is really good ...story line and plot is really awesome and well directed with twists and surprises.
tt8750956,"I really like this show, which surprises even me, but the wait between episodes is even harder than for GoT in the good seasons. The acting is done really well, not just from main characters but even background and supporting ones, and they feel alive, like this place is actually a place that exist. Instead of the feeling like these people are only there to do their job.
The CIG is acceptable, this is not a hollywood production so I am impressed with how much they can get out of the budget. And the sets are also done well, and with story and lore behind them too. You get the feeling that somethings are done because that is how it's always been done.Again I can't wait for season 3, as the ending took a turn I for once din't see coming. Please keep it up :)"
tt8750956,"Please approve for a new season.......
And for God sake don't compare this with game of thrones .. the plot is entirely different ..."
tt8750956,"I like this drama, it's very different of other kdrama, I can't wait for next episode"
tt8750956,"This tv show is so underrated! Yes the first episode was confusing and a lot went on but it basically sets the tone for the entire episodes so far I've seen. I'm up to episode 8 in one sitting, so I binged watch 10 hours of this show (clearly I have time). If you like family drama, history, martial arts, dynasty-era tv shows, and great acting...this tv show has it.This is right up there with ""Chuno - slave hunter"" (another great asian tv-show that is highly underrated)"
tt8750956,"I give it a 7 because I cannot go any higher until I know more.Whether or not I can go back and give it an 8 depends on how well they glue things together in subsequent episodes.Are they making more episodes ? I have it on Netflix. Usually you get a whole season or more. This is odd, having only one episode so far.That being said, I think this is pretty captivating so far.I saw one reviewer so far gave it a rather negative review. I simply disagree.The locations are intriguing, the filming style is intriguing, and the story I think has started off with great potential.It kept my attention in spite of being a foreign film with subtitles and not a lot of cool kung fu moves :) ... although there is violence.Yes I want to know what happens next and who, really, are the good guys and bad guys. So far we have some usual suspects, but, are we really sure ?"
tt8750956,"Losing the actors that actually made the show a hit is unacceptable. The new actors, may be famous, but they are not Eunseom and Tanya. This show is lost. Very sad indeed. Please remake it properly with the actors that made it legendary.The new ones simply dont have the same charm, expresivity or innocent looks. Plus why would you change Nunbyeol. Was perfect for the role. Too expensive or what? Go cheap and go home with this sad impression of a great series. It could have been really good but cheapness made it unbelievably sad and common. I really cant relate to this new cast anymore.Gave it a 10/10 now I switched to 3/10."
tt8750956,"THIS CANT BE THE END!! THERES SO MANY STORIES LEFT UNTOLD. I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEANTHEALS, NYUNBYEOL, SAYA AND EUNSOMA, TANYA AND EUNSOMA, THE AGO TRIBE. THE WAR!"
tt8750956,"I would give this show a 8 stars so far, but I give it a 10 to counteract some undeserved reviews.This is not a carbon copy, nor is this show influenced by Game of Thrones. If you are familiar with Korean Historical dramas, they are usually set in politically treacherous time in Korean history. The same goes for all East Asian historical dramas. Game of Thrones' political twists, you might say, are merely influenced by historical events. In fact, Martin admitted as much.Arthdal Chronicles is loosely based on Korean mythology regarding the First City called Ah-sa-dal. The names mentioned within the shows are loose derivations of characters in the mythology. This is just a fantacy twist of how Korean Historical dramas usually go. All the political backstabs and maneuverings are standard in Korean shows depicting the past.With that said, the show is beautifully choreographed and its aesthetics are top notch. I would not expect anything less from Studio Dragon production."
tt8750956,"There are fantasy shows that have everything that makes fantasy great, and there are many that try and fail. Game of Thrones is one that succeeded. Arthdal Chronicles is another. So they have something in common. And no matter which fantasy show you take, you will probably find some king sitting on a throne and some women in pretty dresses, swords and castles. Game of Thrones was based on the scandinavian Edda, an old myth. A lot of fantasies are based on old myths, its what makes them so interesting - they remind us of fairytales we heard in childhood. And at the same time, if they are great, they are unique. Arthdal Chronicles has created something beautifully different from what we have seen before. It is creative, imaginative, captivating. The series started a little slow, but quickly found its pace. It has great actors, who very clearly do their best to bring their roles alive. It is not an American production, so sometimes the characters don't act like you would expect them to. I consider this a good thing. I hope it will stay true to itself and continue its story in the next season. It should get the recognition it deserves."
tt8750956,"I really love this drama so much!!! The fact that this is the very first ancient historical drama makes me want to see the end of this drama so much. I have no complaints to this drama. This drama also gives the viewers an idea that there also another creatures living in this universe, not just us humans and we have to stop judging them. It also tells us that the one who is very close to us is going to be our hardest enemy in the future. This drama deserves 10/10 ratings and needs to return on airing on tv shows."
tt8750956,"This is not a rambling formulaic series, this IS a cohesive, character-driven story. It Really ticks me off to read negative reviews from people who only watched one episode, or can't even get the character names right (talking to you, ""Decider""). I've watched the 12 episodes available so far. The characters evolve, they are not cardboard cutouts that remain static. The beautiful world is progressively both viscerally and intellectually challenging for those characters, and the viewer follows that progression along with the characters. We know more and more as they know more and more; and so the payoff after the first 12 episodes is very satisfying and sets up big anticipation for the remaining six.I'm a big fan of Asian drama (typically C or K), and I know very well most of the tropes about harem or CP schemes, fantasy falls and rebirths, empire desires, and fated love stories...both tired and well-done. This is different and refreshing, and Very well done. I felt very ""dropped in"" to the world of the series. I won't plot it out because it hasn't finished airing yet, and from the trailer of the final 6, this drama will continue to subvert expectations in a good way. But PLEASE, don't believe the reviews of people who didn't watch it."
tt8750956,First episode starts off kind of slow with bad CGI but things pick up after the backstory. Every episode has twists and leaves a cliff-hanger ending keeping you on the edge of your seat for the next episode. Plot is well thought out and the acting is great. I usually don't watch Korean Dramas but this is definitely captivating to watch!
tt8750956,"Each episode gets better and pulls you further into the world that has been created.I liked first few episodes just, but by episode four I loved it! The depth of character, plot and world building is incredible. Every single actor is an incredible actor but I think it takes to episode four to really appreciate that, as at first there's so many different characters to introduce.It's unusual in any film/tv show, to have every single character regardless of role size to be so skilled and frankly, engagingly brilliant, but even though there are so many roles in this epic production, every single character/actor connects with the audience and gived a real sense of who the characters are in this. So impressive.I've only given 8 stars as the last few episodes I didn't think matched the quality of the others.I think from episode 16-18 it went somewhat downhill and what had seemed really tight structured plot up to there, sort of unravels for me. The production values are still present but the story wasn't as tight and flowing. Episode 18 was really disappointing as did not tie anything up. Didn't even leave it on a tight, suspenseful cliffhanger, it just ended an episode.Increasingly across the board, tv and films have been so shallow depth-wise. I've gotten so fed up of the kind of cr@p being released that I rewatch shows/films that were well made, gotten so used to lazy writing, casting, direction and bad acting that I was not expecting to find a treasure like this.I won't spoil the plot. But anyone looking on here to see if this is worth watching. First few episodes were ok, but from four, it goes up and up in awesomeness, the first three being the foundation. But then after getting through more episodes, the first few are re-evaluated in.hindsight because the reason they're different is because you're seeing literal character life development and world expansion, as they experience more at which point I appreciate the first few with fresh eyes if that makes sense.Those whom wrote this, directed it, acted in it, created the set/cgi, edited, produced, are brilliant. If only others could produce this level of tv/film quality instead of the stale hurty brain deadening rubbish that's generally churned out.This was released, I think, in 2019, and seems to be on hiatus, I hope they do a second season. This is sooo good.I highly recommend."
tt8750956,"This had so much potential.. Great Story.. Great Setting.. Well written characters on paper.. but despite it's great potential, for me, it never really took off. I have finished 12 episodes.. after 4 I couldn't help it and kept using fast forward.. the writing is poor despite a great script.. Tagon is shown to be too powerful at times and helpless otherwise. Apart from the Cliff Ladders, I don't think they put any budget elsewhere... There's hardly any effort to show large crowds or guards for that matter.. I'm watching it only because I need to know how it will end."
tt8750956,"Dying to watch the upcoming episodes
Very well done series
Interesting script amazing cinematography and production design
Perfect directing beautiful locations etc etc"
tt8750956,"Season 1:
The first season was just okay. As they only presented the universe of arthdal and the characters, the last few episodes were only entertaining when it comes to the story.So, the whole setting is magnificent and the cinematography is amazing. The costumes and make up were top notch as well. I don't really like the way they divided the series into three seasons though, as it didn't make sense and they didn't concluded the first season smoothly.That said, the first episodes presented the whole arthdal universe. However, they should have made a better job with it, as it was not easy to understand it and it takes a while to remember the characters (part of the three main).Overall, the three main characters were the best part of the drama, in addition to the cinematography. They were interesting and well presented. The performances were excellent as well.So, seven out of ten, because the story hasn't even progressed yet."
tt8750956,"It is disheartening to see the decision to change the cast in the second season of this series. This change has left many of us feeling that the show has lost its essence and may not live up to the high standards set by the first season. The replacement of both the female and male leads, who were truly exceptional in their roles, is difficult to accept. They brought a unique and irreplaceable charm to the series. It's challenging to imagine that anyone else could match their brilliance(According to first season). As someone who eagerly awaited the second season due to the excellence of the first, it's disappointing that the new cast doesn't evoke the same emotions and connection. The magic that the original leads brought to the show seems to be missing. It's hard to believe that this change will yield the same results and capture the hearts of the audience in the same way. Frankly, it doesn't make much sense to replace casts in second season. This has certainly dampened our enthusiasm for the second season."
tt7909970,"Fascinating and compelling from the first few minutes of episode 1 through the next 8 hours of interest that didn't release me til dawn. Talk about binge-watching without regret that what began at around 8 pm had me watching the sun come up. Now that's the best review I could offer. It was everything I love -a mystery, brilliant detective work and deep characterization that had me knowing and caring about these people. The conversations were quiet and understated without any sort of rehearsed wit that sacrifices authenticity for canned cleverness. No, this was miles above anything I've seen."
tt7909970,"This series is based on a series of rapes that occurred in Washington and Colorado between 2008 and 2011. The original reporting of the story won a Pulitzer prize. The real ""Marie"" has seen the Netflix series and felt that they got it right.It's great to see the essence of this story translated into a captivating miniseries. It was hard to stop watching until I got the end.Even though the style of storytelling is basically the same that you'll in Lifetime TV movie, it's still very well done. In part this is due to the sense that these events really happen, with little fictional padding, and in part to some great acting by the main cast.There are a lot of ""lessons"" that we all can collectively take from this story. It's well worth a watch if the topic interests you."
tt7909970,"As a father this is your worse nightmare you can imagine for your child. The callousness of all those ""who love and support"" the victim was tough to watch. I hope that we have come further along instead of constant victim shaming. Tough watch, but worth it...."
tt7909970,"Just excellent, from start to end. The acting, the story, the directing, the start and the end. Brilliant! I found myself rewinding many scenes just to watch them again due to great acting and dialogue. I usually never do that since it kinda mess up the episode (Im picky), but couldnt help myself.Keep up this kinda work Netflix, and Disney wont have a chance."
tt7909970,"You will squirm, you will be uncomfortable, you will feel the suspense and you will cry..
That's how powerful and amazing the 8 episodes of this show were..The first 2 episodes were even difficult to watch because of the physical and emotional brutality shown.Must watch.
9.5/10"
tt7909970,"Honestly this was the best series I have seen on TV in years . It was perfectly crafted , Acted and Written. I can't give this enough praise , I really do hope it wins an award ."
tt7909970,"I am not going to re-write those reviews which found the series compelling. It is. And there are plenty of characters to root for. The performances - the two officers - are great. However the series does feel stretched-out to achieve the eight episodes.There are red-herrings a'plenty in the late episodes. The possibility of two suspects really goes nowhere. The cop-suspect angle as well. The final episode is essentially a post-script to the series; we get characters apologizing, then apologizing again, and once more. The 'guilty' get their comeuppance and then get it again. I was certain that the final episode would have at least one dramatic revelation. But no.In any case, despite my impatience and sometime-frustration, I found the series worth watching."
tt7909970,"I wasn't fully aware of the story, but after I watched episode one I decided to look into it, I stuck with it, and I'm glad I did. That poor girl, the ordeals she went through, physically, medically, and psychologically, with those who should have protected her treating her as a criminal.It's an addictive story, you will feel angry and annoyed, and at one stage satisfied. Toni Collette is magnificent throughout, it is very well acted.It's tragic in this day and age that someone can be raped, and be made to feel like a liar, I'm not saying people don't lie, because they do, but the assumption should be that they're a victim.Compelling, 9/10."
tt7909970,"... had me glued to screen until the last two episodes when the desire to spread the events over far too many adverts became apparent and it staggered to a finish like a marathon runner about to hit the wall. A shame, because the three female leads were exceptional."
tt7909970,"I'm sorry, but I just don't get all the ""10"" ratings. I love a good detective piece, and kudos to Collette, Wever, and Dever for their fine acting skills, and I appreciate the writers' efforts to raise issues about social injustice as it applies to rape cases. BUT, this limited series drags and drags and drags.There were so many pointless scenes that were clearly meant to enhance the character development, but no one evolves in any way. There's nothing all that interesting about how the case progresses-just a series of clues (with many dead ends) that move along at a snail's pace. In fact, I laughed out loud way into Episode 6 where Collette and Wever discuss how insanely boring police work can be. They certainly got that right!I really wanted to like this drama, but maybe I would have if it had been made into a 2-hour film and cut out all the filler scenes. Ugh."
tt7909970,"I created this account just to write this review. This show was, at times, hard to watch because you connect so well with the characters. It transitions perfectly between two story lines never feeling like you are getting cut off too soon. The acting is phenomenal and the message is one that needs to be heard. It does an amazing job of following the article written by ProPublica. I recommended it to all my girlfriends and, only a few episodes in, they are saying the same. Best limited series I've seen in quite some time."
tt7909970,"Not often I'm impressed by writing, directing & acting, but holy hell......how explosive is the dialogue & acting? Every woman in this is sharp, strong, and just oozes feminine power without coming off as cheesy or put-on or try-hard. Just a gang of tough chicks obsessed with their jobs. I also mega loved the realistic parenting/homelife stuff with the chick as the head of a household instead of a dude.....these dudes are supportive, loving & understanding but without being emasculated or 'paraded' like some parody character, as most shows do with the stay at home/supporting dad/husband role.Super impressed with the writing & dialogue."
tt7909970,"This is an amazing mini series from start to finish, very well acted, scripted, produced and directed.. some stellar performances throughout.. i was hooked from the first episode, I couldn't fault it, better than your average routine CSI's or SVU's etc, Netflix has produced some turkey's in the past, but on occasion they give us something that needs praise for, so thank you Netflix for this one..Merritt Wever and Toni Collette were outstanding and work very well together.. not to mention Kaitlyn Dever and Danielle MacDonald who's performances also need recognition.. this definitely deserves another season in my opinion.."
tt7909970,"The two lead detective roles played by Toni Collette and Merritt Wever are performances I won't easily forget, and are the highlight of the show. Unbelievable has a realistic, real world kind of style to the script which can be dry at times but also adds an extra layer of realism to the show."
tt7909970,Kaitlyn Dever is an incredible young actor! We binge watched the whole thing in a day.
tt7909970,A tense gripping Drama . Incase you liked Law and order SVU than you are going to love this series. If violent sex crimes offend you than give this series a miss. I will highly recommend this series.
tt7909970,"The ending credits provide the usual ""...fictitious characters..."", but this is a true story which occurred in Lynnwood, Washington, a northern suburb of Seattle. I remember it well; so when I spotted, ""fictitious"" as the credits rolled, I was curious as to why.This eight-part series could have been done quite well in less episodes, as there was a lot of wasted time with idle chatter between the two female detectives.However, the Lynnwood victim's horrific journey was extremely well done. Casting Kaitlyn Dever in the role was perfect. She does a magnificent job.As a result of the Lynnwood case, changes have been made in the way rape victims are now handled. Woefully late, but at least a bright light has been shed on how law enforcement handles victims. She went through hell on earth."
tt7909970,"I hardly ever write reviews but this is so good, I just had to turn some of this experience into written words.The acting - just all of it - is absolutely outstanding. The three lead-women should be up for every tv-award there is.
Then there's the writing and directing, which is probably the only appropriate take on the extremely sensitive topic this show is dealing with I, have ever witnessed on TV.
I watch a lot of Detective-Shows and movies and it's usually about the ""thrill of catching the bad guy"" or about the viewer's chance to ""look evil in the face"". And I'm not saying that's all bad - there's a lot of excellent stuff like this out there. But this brilliant show, for a much needed change, is actually about the victims and what such a horrible experience does to you. It's about a certain and unfortunately often overlooked kind of bravery and about commitment.Don't miss out on this gem!"
tt7909970,"This is a good show and rape is a horrible scarring thing that should not be trivialised, by any means. But the way this show tackles this very serious matter is so bland, stereotypical and forcefully inclusive.
Women, wrapped in blankets with pillows on their tummies talking about their feelings. Strong all female detectives, with perfect family lifes, that treat a rape case with a passion as if it's a serial killer case. Rape victims of all sizes, ages and colours do things that you would expect an emotionally disturbed woman to do. Like moving house and unpacking boxes, baking cookies or putting physical things in order. Men being portrait as insensitive and uncooperative. I could literally go on forever.My point is, the show in itself Is entertaining, keeps you watching and draws you in. But I was constantly taken out because of the bland and forcefully 'strong female' writing. It simply feels like it does not really reflect the real world. Which does not mean women can't be powerful, smart and capable. But this show puts the scale up to 200% and forces it down the viewers throat with no subtlety. It felt artificial."
tt7909970,"Henry David Thoreau said ""It's not my job to do everything, but something."" The script of this series failed to do something because it tried to push every button. Male cops didn't believe a rape victim but female cops came to the rescue. Frankly, every male in this show is a creep, a bumbling cop, or a weakling. Not opposed to shows that portray female characters with depth. It's about time! But on top of the other flaws in this show, add unrealistically two-dimensional characters. Kaitlyn Dever is emotive and sympathetic in the leading role, but I'm afraid that's all the good acting you're going to get. The two detective characters suck bad. Not sure if it's acting, directing or script, but something stinks.
For the record I'm not saying she would have been well-treated in real life. (And this was based on a real story.) I totally believe the basic theme of the show. Just think the script dramatized the issues poorly.
8.4 out of 10?? I think this thing was up-voted for reasons of political correctness, rather than dramatic quality."
tt7909970,"A must watch. This series is so gripping. The acting, the direction, way of moving forward in the story. A Masterpiece I must say. Netflix finally got this right :))"
tt10482560,"I'm a 48 year old man who still loves his cartoons. Kipo caught my attention just by the animation alone.Very well written, funny, emotional. Enjoyable for all."
tt10482560,"This show is so good in it's own way and the musical aspects of it are undeniably incredible, every single song is catchy and wonderful. I love the characters and especially the main character Kipo :) I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys their animated shows and wants to have a good time."
tt10482560,"Kipo and The Age of Wonderbeasts is one of the best shows ever made from DreamWorks Television Anination and Netflix. I does remind me a lot like Avatar: The Last Airbender, in fact, the animation reminds me a lot like not only Avatar, but also great shows like Voltron: Legendary Defender, She-Ra: Princess of Power (2018), and The Legend of Korra. Also, both the story and the characters are really nice too. I think it's best for me to recommend this show to anyone. I give it a 9.5/10"
tt10482560,Kipo and the age of Wonderbeasts it's probably one of the best cartoons I've watched in a while. The colors they use are so vibrant and fun and the music choices are phenomenal. The balance of color and music is just out of this world and that alone makes the show great. The plot is brilliant and so intriguing and the pacing of the show is so so good. each season just gets better and better. I didn't think they could get better than season 2 and they proved me wrong. Watch the show you'll love it. See for yourself how just great this wonderful show is. My only thing is I wish it was you longer. There are a few questions I still have but they're so nitpicky I won't even get into them. I just wish we had more time with these awesome characters.
tt10482560,"I enjoy Anime and animated series/movies - when they are good. Delightedly, ""Kipo"" is one of them.The premise is interesting, the characters are nicely defined and ultimately very interesting, and the story quite fascinating and fresh.The music used is also quite incredible and really helps to draw you into the world."
tt10482560,"This show went absolutely above and beyond my expectations. While I went in thinking it might be an enjoyable watch when I've got nothing better to do, I've now seen the whole first season and am on the edge of my seat waiting for more! The animation is pleasing to watch, the voice acting is perfect, the characters are diverse and have well-written and intriguing backstories, and the overall feel is exciting and fun, but with darker undertones that really ramp-up the experience for older viewers. On top of all that being enough to keep me engaged, the music is exceptionally well-chosen and clearly had a lot of thought put into it, giving me a mixed vibe of Steven Universe's Rebecca Sugar songs, and oddly enough, the Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack. Overall I'd say this is a great family show for tween/teenaged kids and any adult looking for a playful escape that isn't mindless like many cartoons made nowadays."
tt10482560,"Everything about this show is fantastic. The animation, art style, music, plot, world building - all top notch.Some people complain about 'politics' in the show, but they're referring to a single moment where one character tells another that they are gay, which is apparently 'too political' for the commenters.This show is a true gem. If you liked Dreamworks' prior Netflix cartoons, you will love this.Get into it before the Reddit crowd ruins the ratings with a mass protest against it."
tt10482560,"The animation style is pleasing! Story wise I would say that it is something people Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and She-ra fans would enjoy.
I believe that the show has a lot of potential to be loved.
You all should give it a chance before judging, otherwise you'll never know."
tt10482560,"I like the animation, it reminds me of the 90's while still appearing fresh.The plot is unique, even if the premise isn't. The premise of living in a world after devastation that is."
tt10482560,"So i started watching it since the first season got released
the first season was very good
showing a post apocalypse world
different animal different thinking and behavior and good fight scene
season 2 wasn't as great as season 1 but still had deep plot
but i believe everything god messed up in season 3
they just finished the show as fast as they could
wondering why people loved the last season because in my opinion it's the worst one
but still it's not a bad show if you love post apocalypse movies or seires"
tt10482560,"Both Kiddos really enjoyed all three seasons of this show, and went through them pretty quickly - though they do rank it below She-Ra and Avatar. I watched most of the episodes, and for me, Kipo is just such a fabulous character, with her combination of exuberance and strong sense for what's right, that she steals the show. The idea of humans learning how to live side-by-side with mutant animals is a nice change from the usual concern in science fiction with robots and artificial intelligence, and the idea of REVERSE genetically engineering them back to ""normal,"" and thus taking away their mind, is also really original. Though it is also problematic in that it under-emphasizes the sentience of the animals we live with today. It was also interesting that the apocalypse itself is never discussed--in my view, unfortunate choice. Finally, if you enjoyed this show, check out Nausicaa and the Valley of the Winds, from 1984, which has a very similar plotline: a heroine tries to re-unite humanity and the mutated natural world (toxic jungles and giant insects) some centuries after an apocalyptic event."
tt10482560,Well-written story and characters. Very solid animated show. No complaints at all.
tt10482560,"When i watched the first few minutes of the first episode i though it would be this gritty post-apocalyptic adventure series, and that got me really excited beause we dont really have a lot of animated cartoons out there like that, and the sad part is that the show was ALMOST that but in the end it fell just short. My main gripe is that the show is just too goofy for me to take it seriously, the majority of the episodes i watched was mostly about ""woohoo! Were escaping anthropomorphic frogs! This is totally epic!"" every time i felt like i was actually going to like the show it just threw something silly at the screen and completely lost my attention. Now look, im not saying everyone is going to hate this show, i can actually see the appeal (especially for kids) its got great animation, voice acting and well flushed out characters, even though i wasnt a big fan of it i would still recommend checking it out."
tt10482560,My young son and I are watching this together. We both absolutely adore it.
tt10482560,"Full of cool colors, music, positive messages, fantasy, delightful animation, and gobs of creativity, this show apparently designed for tweens offers so much more for the rest of us!"
tt10482560,"Like. The earth is so dark. Thank goodness for shows like these. One of the creative minds behind Kipo is named Rad Sechrist. Rad! I wish more people would give this show a shot. Be more rad. I don't know why people are not watching well written creative art. I don't know. But please, don't stop being RAD. Thank you writers! Xoxo"
tt10482560,"Goodness Kipo is such a well animated show with a beautiful story! I had to binge EVERY episode as soon as I seen the trailer I was kinda interested but let me tell ya guys and gals this series is worth the watch. Kipo will reels you into this fantasy world that has some comedic and tragic events.
Music:10/10
Story:9/10
Animation:10/10"
tt10482560,"The fact that the protagonist's voice actor also voices Glimmer in the new She-Ra series is the original reason I began watching this series. I was wowed by the visuals, the story, and the thrilling adventure this series brought me on. I'd highly recommend it to anyone. It has some LGBTQ representation, mainly through Benson, who is a gay character. Apart from that, this series has a well-developed story, characters, and everything else, like humor and a compelling narrative which will draw you in like a magnet. I love this show as much as Cleopatra in Space, it's just that the latter show has more world building, more characters, and can be more snappy. It's a hard decision to put this at its current rating, but it makes sense."
tt10482560,"Great show for kids & adults. Loved every single concept of this show. The honey bees were my favorite. It's a must see show for sure. Funny, action packed, sad and joyful. Perfect score for me on this one. Great story, GREAT message behind it!! WATCH IT NOW!"
tt10482560,"Hey, it's about time Glimmer got her own show! This is Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts - First Impressions.Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts, created by How to Train Your Dragon 2 story artist Radford Sechrist, takes place in a world where mutated animals have taken over, and nature has swallowed the ruins of human civilization. While some human survivors remain on the surface, most have descended into underground communities known as burrows. After Kipo's burrow is attacked by a mysterious giant mutant animal, she manages to escape to the surface.There, she makes friends with Wolf, Benson, Dave, and Mandu, and they go on journeys of exploration together.Can I just say that this show's story is well-crafted. Everything fits together so perfectly, and there's a lot of lore and world-building. The characters work off each other well, their backstories are touching, and their interpersonal relationships are examined in great detail.The animation reminds me of anime, and has pretty nice shading. I also like that the show is driven by music. The character Benson loves music, and the main character Kipo writes and performs her own original songs. This show has one of the most memorable soundtracks I've seen in a cartoon since Ready Jet Go. Pop, hip-hop, it's good stuff.But of course, a show like this isn't without its flaws. To get the elephant out of the room, this show is boring. Seriously, even though the episodes are good, they take a million years to get finished, which is bizarre because the episodes only last 22 minutes. I think this show should be 11 minutes instead of 22 minutes. I have a preference for 11 minute shows because they are quick and easy to binge, whereas with half-hour shows, they consume a good portion of your time and are harder to binge. Then again, I've only seen half the episodes of the show, so maybe the show will pick up the pace in the second half. Anyways, that's it for this review. If you like Adventure Time or She-Ra, definitely check out the show."
tt10482560,"Kipo is a beautiful, emotional and unique show that is unlike anything I've seen before. I love it's worldbuilding and huge cast of characters, and the music, the music is outstanding!!! Some of the best original music from a cartoon. The show can feel slow, particularly in the early season 2 episodes, but it evolves into a masterpiece by season 3 (a wonderful ending and the best season in my opinion). It has diversity, representation, and fantastic characters. A total standout from Netflix and a gem of 2020. Cartoons this decade will be hard pressed to match the standard of the Age of Wonderbeasts!!"
tt10482560,"The art is insanely good. The world building is amazing. Its the biggest shame because the story is predictable and boring. The plot is super forced by the characters making silly decisions. I assume the budget went into the background and character designs because the animation was really lacking in a lot of places although there were a couple scenes that were satisfying to watch from an animation perspective. There was an interesting theme about class structure i thought was going to be explored, but it didnt go very deep. It wasnt a big deal since this is a childrens show and you cant expect too much on that front. I guess i was expecting more given i was a fan of Radford's work. If you like appreciating great art in a show with cliched characters and sorta budgeted animation, go watch it!"
tt10482560,"Do you like beautiful art? Do you like interesting world building? Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts creates an interesting post-apocalyptic world that it immediately dumps the viewer into without warning. You are made to feel as confused as Kipo at the beginning when she slides out of a pipe into a post-apocalyptic world filled with fantastical beasts and beautiful scenary.But then, Kipo opens her mouth. And, it never closes. It goes on and on and on. And then she meets a friend named Wolf. Wolf HATES Kipo. Or does she? Kipo is about to die. But then Wolf saves her. Kipo says something dumb. Wolf says, ""I'm not going to save you."" Wolf saves Kipo. Wolf's only going to help Kipo a little, she swears. Oh wait, she's going to do everything for Kipo. Wolf is the predictable character that hates everything and always predictably comes to Kipo's rescue. And then there's Benson and his bug buddy. They're the comic relief. They're buds, but they also steal. But they're so likeable! They're so likeable, you won't even remember that you didn't laugh at anything they ever did. And did we even mention the villains? They're frogs in suits. That's great? There's also a pig.Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts has a well thought out world that is filled with bland, uninspired characters and villains. Every character is so trite and predictable that it completely ruins any interest in the story as it is apparent where it is going. The humor is low quality and I cannot recall laughing a single time. Compare this to a show like Adventure Time or Gravity Falls, which are gold standards of what modern cartoons can be: In those, the humor is on-point, the characters are interesting and distinct, and the plots riveting and unpredictable (at least, when invoked in Adventure Time).Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts doesn't have that. The whole thing feels like a cacophony of influences ripped from popular shows in an attempt to gain some of their success, such as Avatar: The Last Air Bender and Spiderman: Enter the Multiverse. Except, where those shows were interesting and original, Kipo just feels like a trite, unnatural, and empty imitation. It has all the feeling, but none of the substance.
Also, the frame rate is noticeably low. For all the beauty in the world, it's animated choppily."
tt10482560,"Fun take on the post apocalyptic world. Beautifully drawn. Tackles some issues you'd never expect a show like this to address, like what happens to the rest of the characters if our lead gets fhe happy ending she wants. My family tore through the first season in two days. Well worth a watch. I'd give it 8.5 if that was an option. Not sure how long the show can run but I'll enjoy the ride at least for this early portion. Looking forward t ok season 2. My nine year old daughter loved this! The 5 yrs old couldn't really follow the whole story but still enjoyed watching"
tt10482560,"Thank you for making this show, we all loved it! Best cartoon we've watched in a long while. Ten out of ten from both my son and daughter!"
tt12020952,We need to appreciate more to this kind of series because we're too tired of Indonesian Cringe love story and this series is a fresh start for Indonesian Tv Series.
tt12020952,"When I first heard about this series, I set my expectation as low as possible. Usually, when Indonesians try to adapt foreign cultural products into their own, it will end badly with low quality result.But this is not the case of ""Tunnel"". I really wish they use Indonesian title to distinguish the difference between original Korean series and this Indonesian adaptation, as using the same title can lead to confusion.There is no sci-fi element involved. All the time travelling is done in mystical manner, not futuristic manner. And it fits perfectly with the main theme of this series, which is serial killings based on mystical believes and madness.I have seen so many Indonesian TV series, and rarely they try to dwell into mystery detective thriller. Indonesian ""Tunnel"" is an exception, a very brave one, and it succeeds everything it promises."
tt13087512,This is a stunning portrait of a team of talented kids at a college not known for academics. It's there last chance at the NBA dream. It screams authenticity and is a beautiful look into the minds of these players.Highly recommend to any fans of sports or basketball. It makes you feel what they feel. The pressure. The excitement. The anger. All of it.
tt13087512,"I grew up around people who aspired to play professionally. I only know one person that made it. This series gives insight on the obstacles these athletes juggle in their everyday lives. I love seeing them turn their lives around and overcome injustices, bad decisions and a system that has failed them. This in depth series gives a beautiful depiction of the highs and lows these young athletes go through. Most people do not see the everyday struggle of an athlete. Last Chance U will keep you glued and invested in each player and coach. No matter your background you can gain some gems watching this series."
tt13087512,Last chance U has always been good . It's goes in-depth . Learn more about the sport . They go into detail of the coach and players personally and then it's a rollercoaster of a documentary
tt13087512,"Can you say Coach Carter?? Raw Af.Real Af.Special. Follow this journey and reminisce about the days your boys on the team were as close as the team you were born into...Family. You won't find a sports documentary that draws you in and takes you through this rollercoaster of emotion and triumph all the way to a climax that ends with a moment in recent history that changed the the world as much as 9/11 did 20 years ago. Pulling for the young men of ELAC and the coaches of this documentary...I'm invested emotionally in your future success. Thank you all for letting us in...Family on 3, 1-2-3..."
tt13087512,"This series is both heartbreaking, inspiring and homie. Any basketball fan will love it."
tt13087512,"So well put together. This team, those coaches, this documentary, just incredible. 10/10. One of the best series I have ever watched"
tt13087512,"This is so beautifully done, it had me glued to the screen. Conflict, comedy, drama it has it all and if you're also a basketball fan or player, you know it's hitting all the right spots."
tt13087512,"I like football more than basketball, however, I like this series better. Coach M. Is a legit man and gets me fired up about my own life. He loves you guys more than you'll ever know. Don't ever forget this man."
tt13087512,"I love LCU football series but the last season was a snoozefest. This brings back the magic: incredible young men with problems stacked against them, some by the own doing, but you are rooting for them all the way in life more importantly; basketball is just the backdrop. these young men and coaches and their loved ones supporting them - they arent just in LA but in everyones backyard just go to your local Juco games amd ahow support. see it first hand. show em love"
tt13087512,"As the team learns that their season's worth of work has been for naught, there is a heavy sense of foreboding. Last Chance U's first season in basketball carries with it the weight of a year suspended - players having their ambitions and dreams curtailed by an opposition they didn't even get to face. The stakes feel slightly lower compared to the show's footballing equivalent, but the sense of community is far more resonant.Most central to these shows is not the players, but the coach at the heart. Coach Mosley is the motor, a god-fearing man converted from a potentially deadly way of life to a path of helping others better themselves. Alongside his equally devoted assistants, they power this high-quality team through game after game, showing the benefit that role models can impart on teenagers from difficult backgrounds.The quality of athlete here is higher than in any of the Last Chance U seasons before, creating some real sporting spectacles. No doubt a couple are looking at going pro in a few years, and this drive makes watching their dreams curtailed by COVID-19 even tougher to accept. They are not all from broken homes and tough lives (as is so often the narrative with this Netflix show) - rather, they are taking their final punts at continuing the sport they love.This shift of narrative is a double-edged sword: the all too real drama of people balancing sport and survival was a great watch, but it wasn't in the best interests of the people involved. This season is a more uplifting angle, looking more at building better people than better athletes."
tt13087512,"So I'm currently on episode 7 right now (which is the second last episode) and I had to write this review before the last episode so as to not let potential heartbreak, that may await me, bias my review. This is absolutely hands down one of the BEST sports documentaries I've ever seen, and that's throwing in some heavy weights like Iverson, More than a game, and Senna.The direction of the documentary is Brilliant. I've realized after reading some reviews that the Last Chance U series has quite a following but I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh the direction was. The series overall feels fresh with the right flavour of Hip -Hop mixed into it. As someone who loves basketball, played through HS and is part of the community, you know what the vibes on gameday were like growing up, when you blasted the latest hip-hop single, got your Jordans, Kobe's or Lebron's out, laced up, and went out to put shots feeling the weight of the world watching you but also the thrill of going into battle.The coaches are what you hear about and see in stories and legends, and you really see the humanity, the struggle and the passion they have for the game. The players are what really take home the cake, of course. Their stories are riveting and bone numbing, with a lot of them having faced some of the toughest challenges middle and lower class kids are subjected too in todays day and age. Some of them have gone through mind numbing ordeals and trials, and how they come through and let their personality flourish through the guidance of the coaches and their love for the game is what pulls you in as each episode ends and you go deeper into the rabbit hole.Overall, its a must watch if you're a person who loves sports, especially basketball. You start to get invested and wanting them to succeed, and you realize going through that the most important thing the documentary shows you a different perspective of everyday kids on their journey through life, growing and molding themselves, which can be summarized by 2 words: Hoop Dreams."
tt13087512,"Kind of boring because there wasn't enough basketball action, should of been alott more. Didn't warm to as many of the players as I did for the football series. The head coach was great, the star of the season."
tt13087512,"Come on! I've watched a few episodes and still have not seen one moment in the classroom. It's like their profession is being a JUCO basketball player. There is no reference to them even being students.Like I said in my review of the first football season of this series, why do they even need to attend college, if their only goal is to go pro? Just create a minor league.Meanwhile their college is in an extremely Asian city, (Monterey Park), where everyone who is not Asian is Hispanic, yet these guys are neither.We don't see any signs of that from crowd scenes. Because there is no coverage of cheerleaders or crowds. Or at least not so far. The culture clash would create an interesting angle. Viewers don't even realize who lives in that part of East L. A.Another profile of shallow 20 year-olds who think they are God's gift to the world, but in reality are not even that good. Plus a coach with a Master's Degree who talks like he just stepped out of the hood. I don't buy that.Although at least he's not playing to the camera the way other coaches did in previous seasons.Let me see players recruited to a JUCO in Vermont or Montana, instead of the South or California. The Kansas football version was interesting.When they play other teams, we see that everyone has a big man, and various talented players. Not just our profiled team. It's a fiercely competitive world. Even for pastry chefs.I'd like to see a John Wooden type of coach some time. One who stressed fundamentals. Not dunks."
tt13087512,"This ones fire, take you into depth with the team love it"
tt13087512,"I'm not a fan of basketball, or any sport for that matter, but this show is much more than just basketball. The insight into the coaches' and players' lives creates a connection that then has me actually caring how well they do in their games, despite me not caring much for sports really. End of episode 7 and beginning of episode 8 was very intense, I was cheering for them with all my heart.Great documentary."
tt13087512,"Last Chance U: Basketball (2021)This is a documentary series that you most likely skipped right through on Netflix without giving it a second thought. However, if you take a moment and watch at least the first episode, you will see how much heart, passion and dedication are put into every chapter of this gritty tale. If you are a fan of sports, you were one day dreaming of becoming a professional athlete; at least I was. I knew it was a long a painful journey but I never imagined that on top of skill and commitment, so much can be determined by a simple chance.Normally, most of the professional basketball players aspire to end up in the NBA. They train hard while playing in school and if they manage to make it to a university, they quadruple that intensity as only a handful make it to the top. This is what an ideal journey looks like but there are those who aren't lucky enough to have this smooth experience. Whether because of personal issues, injuries or sheer bad luck a number of players find themselves in community colleges where intensity must be multiplied tenfold.This documentary deals with a team playing for East Los Angeles Community College. Each player has made a certain mistake in their lives and now they are trying to climb out of that inescapable void to achieve their dream. It is a documentary that hits your hard because it deals with real people and real struggles. Filmed in a highly professional fashion, it has the right balance of heart pounding basketball content and heartbreaking human emotions to keep you attached until the final moment. There are a bunch of fantastic players but the greatest highlight for me was Coach Moalsey who personifies inspiration with every word he says.If you are a fan of sports, any kind of sports, and if you ever dreamed of making it big, you will see what it really takes to scratch that dream. If you aren't a sports fan, you will see that these athletes do a lot more that dribble basketballs.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Shows."
tt13087512,I just wanted to congratulate to everyone from the directors to the players and the amazing coach I wish joy and prosperity to all of them and hope one day they dreams become higher than what they desired. Amazing documentary everyone should hop on and watch and learn from it. Not everyone has rich parents and your way is already scripted these team crafted their way in. I'm lost for words. Last chance U we need another série ASAP
tt13087512,"What I like about this season versus the football seasons is that this coach isn't a prick nor is he looking for his 15 seconds of fame. He's solely about the players and it's evident from the get go. When he does act out, which is seldom, he does so in an adult manner with intent to educate versus curse and launch into the ""glory days"" speeches of how they were all that. This coach is passionate about his family and enjoys lifting his student athletes up however he can. Similar to the football series, this version does a great job of providing an in depth look at some of the teams' top talent and their journey thus far to help you feel for them.
Overall, Last Chance U is headed in the right direction so looking forward to the next season."
tt13087512,"I tend be skeptical of documentary series like this because it's so easy for the filmmakers to manipulate the narrative and the audience's willing suspension of disbelief. Especially in a sports environment, which already has the built-in drama regarding winning and losing.However, I got completely sucked in almost immediately. This is a very well-crafted examination of an intensely dramatic scenario, with vivid & sympathetic characters who are very clearly defined by their individual circumstances, their personalities, and the depth of their need to succeed. For the young basketball players, the pressure to meet the moment and prevail is a constant theme in their lives, which us older adults can see as agonizingly fraught with peril. IT's a bit like watching a slasher film: ""don't go down there! Aggghhh!"". You want these kids, who have been given so little in life to see how their daily choices can reverberate across decades. You there, stifle that impulsivity, and do as I say! It is a nerve-wracking and poignant watch.The head coach is equally fascinating: a deeply devout Christian whose coaching chops would easily translate to Division 1 or 2 college basketball, but chooses to work with kids in East Los Angeles who are struggling to get scholarships to those types of schools. His faith in his players and fervor for guiding them while also constantly tearing them down is a major source of drama. You watch this guy and one minute you're ""what a great guy!"" and then ""what an a*****e!"".And then there are the basketball games, played by real athletes on real teams, some of whom are very talented. The BIG problem with sports movies, is that no matter how hard they try, actors just can't simulate high-level athleticism. The greatest sports movies (not including documentaries) all fail BADLY at presenting athletic performance. These kids can ball."
tt13087512,"This series is fine, but the coach is a major tool. He loves playing to the camera & seems to think the more he can yell & scream and offer meaningless nonsensical sayings, the more intelligent he sounds. Surely the college administration must be embarrassed by this guy. & does he think he'll ever be hired at any other school after they see how he treats people?To top it off, he forces the players to listen to jesus stuff & to loudly proclaim 'amen' at the end. I know Americans love religion , but this way over the top. And why exactly does someone who apparently sings religious songs with his children in the car. ( lol ) think it's fine to treat students terribly by screaming, abusing, & demeaning them?"
tt13087512,"I'm not interested in basketball whatsoever. It just has never been a sport I've enjoyed watching. So I expected that this version wouldn't grab me the same as the football series previous. But the storylines and personal stories grabbed me all the same. I enjoyed the differences in the personalities of the coaching staff. Coach John Mosley is interesting. He has the intensity of some of the notorious coaches of the football series, but has his unique ways of expressing himself. As with Cheer and previous Last Chance U seasons, Greg Whiteley does a good job of showing the struggles of youth in transition."
tt13087512,"Might be the only truthful review on here so far. I'm a huge fan of the football series and have been excited for this season. Been binging and let me tell y'all... probably the most boring thing I've watched. The HC is alright but the players have no energy and the games are not interesting. The first episode was making me sleepy... this is garbage. I want to like it, and I'm glad the players aren't in ""life or death"" scenarios but all of them talk about ""I don't have to do this, I've got other stuff""... they don't care and it shows. This was an absolute bust and black eye for the series. Bring back football or switch to a new school, because it's borderline painful to watch something so hyped up fail. Watch Cheer or re-watch East Miss, don't watch this."
tt13087512,"I find that the better documentaries are driven by character, suspense, or history. This has all three in spades! Whether or not you care about - or even know about - JUCO basketball(I didn't), you'll be caught up in this story from the first episode. It's the best I've seen in '21 and I would dare anyone watching not find yourself rooting for this flawed but lovable team and their equally flawed but inspiring coach."
tt14518756,"The first thing that struck me about this show is that each character is independent, mostly self aware (of course there is room to grow) and making course correcting choices for a work/ mental health balance. Our leading female, Hye-jin is self-driven, stubborn, and self-accomplished. Our leading male, Du-sik, is a savant jack of all trades choosing to live a simple small town life filled with meaningful relationships vs a profitable city career. The episodes are still being released so there is more to unravel, and of course a love triangle, but this show is filled with tender moments, hearty laughs, and a harrowing sorrow for what is beyond our control."
tt14518756,"Laid back K-drama in beautiful seaside village that will make you laugh, cry and appreciate life as it happens. Dimple couple, Seon-ho & Min-ah opened up the series nicely with charming introduction and showed endearing chemistry through reasonable process.Every Gongjin characters (from young to old) have purposes in their own stories, how to overcome challenges and let go of the past. Despite few dragging parts, Yoo Je-won gave enough time for them to grow on audience alongside soothing music and beautiful cinematography as well."
tt14518756,"This is Extra-ordinary. WELL this K-Drama is nothing different or new but felt EXTRAORDINARY because of more ordinary things , people and story.Show setsup a world and stays true to that world. There are cliches, there are expected things happening but it seems very authentic because of the right presentation of characters and their story.It doesn't confuse you much with lot of twists and bringing in unnecessary characters to keep the curiosity or make it forcefully interesting,
At the same time it doesn't get bored, though its almost the same characters that you see in every episodes. Characters are presented in an authentic way and also showing their past playing a role in what they are today.All actors have done their part well, but Best part is of course the acting between the leads - Ufff Sparks fly and they make us feel the chemistry is real but unlike some other Dramas there is no much overacting here.Negatives - So far None , have finished watching 10 episodes. Will update my final review after the final episode.If you are looking for a feel good rom com drama, then watch it for sure. Breeze of romance and goodness will definitely hit you with this show :)"
tt14518756,"EDIT: Now that we are nearly at the end, and as a viewer that has fully immersed myself in this drama right from the start to now (finished episode 15), I can say that this drama is definitely the second best series (after squid game) I've watched in 2021. I like dark dramas, and intense plotting, revenge against each other, weird monsters stuff, but every weekend exactly at 10pm, I find myself waiting impatiently for HTCCC to drop a new episode on Netflix, this is my perfect dose of relaxation. I don't know about cliche storylines or whatsoever, I'm watching because of the chemistry of the entire cast of this drama, the setting, how they are having fun on set. It was almost they were really living in Gongjin. I love how every single family in Gongjin has a story to tell, even right to the beautiful pre-school teacher. The stories were simple, but realistic. Eg, the pregnant store lady part, the little boy whose parents were divorced. I love to watch the two main leads going on their dates, so rarely we get to have 2 full episodes on lovey dovey scenes in k dramas, you know what's the real cliche for me? It's always when the two main leads going on lovey dates and then suddenly one of them sick or die or they just cannot be together. And it usually happen like 15 mins after they are happy. 🤣🤣 Like finally! We get to see my fav couple having a proper date too. Finally can I just say that the OST for this drama is PERFECT. My fav has got to be Here Always by Seungmin!Sorry the other unhelpful review here has prompted me to start an account here to write a proper review of this drama. There was definitely more dialogue going on, so I'm not sure if that reviewer watched the right drama.To start off, this drama has been touted to be a healing drama, and also finally we have Kim Seon Ho as a lead against Shin Min Ah, two dimples visuals here, so really, what's not to love?The first episode started off light heartedly, and I thought it was a great introduction of the fishing village that will likely be the main setting for the rest of the drama, we have Chief Hong being a know-it-all, and also gave Hye-Jin whose likable personality should be a great hit in the village soon after. The cinematography and natural acting of the actors are great and also in this pandemic, after watching several ""heavy"" dramas from TVN, this is definitely a refreshing change and now I can't wait for the next episode to be out!"
tt14518756,"Short story:- It got me hooked from the very first episode.Long story:- I am someone who have watched plenty of Kdramas in the past and so my standard is pretty high for rating a show as positive. Any show which gets me attached and hooked from early on is straight away deserves 10 stars.Lately at the time of writing there is so much negativity and depressing stuff going on in the world and in our life, i was looking for show which can bring smile on my face after hard day at work. I started few Kdramas on Netflix before this and was struggling to find a decent show.About this show, first of all it is believable, the story I mean. It's so simple yet so beautifully crafted. It's relaxing and doesn't stray away from the story much. The rural setting makes you wanna retire to some place like this in your future. The setting of the town is picturesque and full of colours. Both the lead characters are cute looking and instantly lovable. At times, the show will teach you valuable life lessons also. The romance and chemistry between the two characters are pure and angelic. You know they are made for each other.This is so far my analysis of the show after watching the first few episodes of it. Can't wait how the rest of the story will unfold. So interesting."
tt14518756,This drama is so fresh.it's so lightweight and gives the right amount of butterflies we need.i know it's early to say this but this drama has healed me.i needed this.this made me feel so loved and comforted.the acting was amazing.cinematography is absolutely stunning.peaceful and aesthetic.so far i'm loving this drama.
tt14518756,"This is probably my most anticipated kdrama of the year and I am glad to say that I enjoyed every second of it. I usually stay away from romcoms because they tend to have the same formula but homecha is different from the rest.Yes, there was romance and there was comedy, but there were more layers and depths to it; the complexities and simplicity of different types of relationships (romantic, platonic, familial, friendships, etc), the sense of belonging in a community, living life the way you want to, grief and guilt, etc. I smiled, laughed and even cried while watching this.And I love the found family trope in this show, it was so heartwarming how everyone became a huge family and supported each other. The cast was incredible, and thanks to the great writing, they brought so much life and variety to the show. On that note, I have to mention that Kim Seonho and Shin Min-a have amazing chemistry and honestly, the person who casted them deserves a raise. This show is a gem and kudos to the entire team that worked on it because they created something that touched many people's hearts."
tt14518756,"It's impossible not to fall in love with the character of Hong Du Sik. He is a total Renaissance man: capable, accomplished, considerate, humorous, athletic, and very good looking.While the characters seem at first glance to follow a standard construct, I am anticipating that the story arc will continue to be intelligent, as it is touching on a number of contemporary issues to do with prejudice and assumptions. The writer seems to have developed considerable back stories and subtext for the majority of the characters, although we are not yet privy to all of them (as of episode four).I'll edit and update as the season progresses."
tt14518756,"After watching first 2 episodes, i found this drama lightweight in storyline, heartwarming in storytelling, funny in between characters interaction. Plus, it's cinematic background just like I went to watch the place myself. 😍No big events & so heavy topics up until now, so i think this drama can be a healing ""me time"" after a long exhausted working days. It suitable to watch together with family too. It's gonna be fun relating Gongjin Villagers's story to our life too.For romance part, i think its like typical love story but maybe when the main leads start push & pull their real feelings, we will enjoying it more. Just like the drama title, i hope the drama will make my heart dance cha cha cha at every episode's ending.P/s: their first ost is very catchy! They got me lallalalalala after both episode!"
tt14518756,"To be honest this series could have been easily compressed to be a 10-12 episode series instead of 16. Total waste of time towards the end to be honest.No doubt the cast was nicely done, the story is simple and heart warming. The star of the show is the lead couple, especially Kim Seon-Ho. I also liked the title track 'Sunday'. Nice.While watching the series I got so bored that I watched two other series and finished it and one Hollywood movie. I somehow managed to finish the show in the end.There is no way this series deserves a rating of 8+. A 6 is appropriate.Also even after watching this series I don't understand what the title means - Hometown Cha Cha Cha. What does this even mean?!"
tt14518756,"This drama story seems simple but give some nice twist on every episode. Humble story, nice story telling but give lots of message in life."
tt14518756,"This was such a chill-out, light-hearted, and unproblematic drama that was shot near the seaside area, so had AMAZING cinematography. Every shot was picture perfect, the colours were well balanced, and the captures of nature were absolutely breathtaking.This is like a photographer's dream.That being said, the overall drama is quite nice. It's easier to take into the mind too. After a stressful day, you can watch this and be at ease. The drama doesn't have any heavy plots that keep you thinking about it throughout the week. While it's not a boring watch at all, it doesn't have the thought-provoking or intriguing aspect to it. So, we can watch an episode, feel good, forget till the next episode.Everything about the drama is very predictable from the get-go and the characters are not deeply fleshed out. Everyone's a good person too. Therefore, not much difficult acting is required. Which is quite fortunate because the main cast were mediocre actors.As much as I love and adore Shin Minah, her acting range is quite limited and if you binge-watch the episodes, there is a probability of you getting a bit annoyed with her ""baby talking"", and the same three expressions for everything. Kim Seonho on the other hand displayed good acting in the latter episodes even though he was very stiff in the early episodes. This could be due to the way his character was written as a too-perfect guy at first (which tends to be quite boring) and then later we find he has a bit of layer to him which makes him more interesting. Lee Sangyi is a new addition to my drama watching and I have to say he's a fresh find. I've already seen him in Prison Playbook but I did not know it was the same actor who played the murderous bully in Prison Playbook and is now playing the nicest guy in this show. He has an amazing singing tone and seems to have great potential as an actor too. However, he still needs improvement which I'm sure I will see from his future acting jobs.Other than the main cast, the supporting cast does a decent job and their stories are very interesting that keep you engaged in the drama. I for one watched the drama mainly for the stories of the others especially the story about the two divorcées and the teacher, their child's reaction to their relationship, the ex-star singer's story, which I found quite compelling.To conclude, I recommend this drama for you if you like a peaceful watch without many complications. The mesmerizing sceneries will be an added advantage!"
tt14518756,"So I had high hopes for this one. I love both main actors. I'm so disappointed, especially with the character of Hye-Jin. She's been portrayed as a clingy, selfish and teenage woman and its ruined the whole thing for me.So Du-Sik didn't open up to her about his trauma- HIS trauma- that he's seeing help about within the first week of them dating...apparently that's worth taking a break over?? Also when she semi finds out about what he's keeping to himself...she's the one sobbing and saying she's not okay????? I hated this aspect of it, it made me really not like this drama.The subplots were very good and Du-Sik himself was an excellent character but the show has been ruined for me by the female lead."
tt14518756,"In this era of all dark themed dramas, This drama will sooth your eyes and refresh your minds💚
I expected this drama to be slow paced but this is not slow and evolves beautifully.💙
And the cast is just perfect. Kim Seon Ho and Shin Min Ah really put their best efforts anf their chemistry is just adorable. Kim Seon Ho showing off his muscular body in some shots are 🔥🙈.The other charecters of the drama are relatable to all like we all have these kind of people in our lifes. They all have their own stories in their lives that makes this drama more appealing.In short the best healing drama of 2021.💚💙"
tt14518756,"It's so sweet that it saddens my heart to realise that I will never have this kind of love .Nobody will buy me tangerines when I am sick , nobody will eat my porridge even if it's bad , I will have no one to run to if somebody is following me. Nobody will smile at me like chief doesSo I have decided to live this love so sweet through this masterpiece. I hope Kimseon Ho keeps smiling ,he is captivating, teaching kindness wherever he goes and Shinmin-a has never disappointed me, she is exquisite ,you will know if you have seen ""oh my venus"".I don't want this series to end and I want the writers to keep the humour alive , thanku for goodnight dreams,. I think I will never get over this."
tt14518756,A disillusioned city girl heads to the seaside and meets up with a local popular character who she clashes with initially but over time they come together but he has issues from his past that could tear them apart. A great cast with superb performances and side stories make each episode enjoyable. Anything with Shin Min-a in is always watchable because she plays an adorable love interest like no other. The chemistry with her co stars is always believable and in this series Kim Seon-ho as her partner puts in a sterling performance.
tt14518756,"Sunday, 17th October 2021Just finished with HOMETOWN CHA-CHA-CHA
.The last 2 episodes were really one heck of an emotional roller-coaster. Undoubtedly one of my most cherished Kdramas ever! Had the perfect balance of Romance, Comedy and Melodrama. Very heartwarming, the characters portrayed in such a way that you'd love to come to visit it every now and then. Indeed the best Rom-Com Kdrama of the yearAnd glad Kim Seon-ho finally had a happy ending!My inner 'Start-Up' rage is now at rest."
tt14518756,"What a charming series! One of two most lovable K-dramas I've seen , along with «Crash Landing on You» (I've seen 3 digit tv-series, so far!). You will be absolutely addicted once you watch it (the epilogue of each episode are incredible!) ... and will fall in love with the leading stars, especially with Kim Seon-ho.Kim Seon-ho is making a storm in K-drama world these days! «Home Cha-Cha-Cha» is doing great. Fans of him are going crazy how good he is in this TV-series and the very lovable chemistry between him and his leading lady, SMA.I think, it actually began with his role as Han Ji Pyung in «Start-Up» where he totally outshined the leading actors.I can explain though this on-going phenomenon. Kim Seon-ho is gifted with a baby face which is sweet, innocent and handsome... and a youth-looking body (hoping he stays that way and won't be pumping much muscles like most actors do) with an amazing physique like an athlete. Just watch his remarkable performances in 2 Days and 1 Night... he stands out in almost every task he does! His charm... Wow! Who doesn't melt seeing him smile or laugh? Add his dimples too!What impresses me most though is his acting skills, either with or without dialogues. He is such a natural talent! Every facial and body movements of his give significance to his role/character. Need I mention, «micro-expressions»? The way he delivers his lines is beyond perfect. He owns the stage/screen when he performs! He steals the scene/show from his co-performers and he absolutely captures his audience! We smile, when he smiles... we cry, when he cries.I hope I am not being unfair to the remaining cast and to the crew, being so focused on Kim Seon-ho. The leading lady, Shin Min-a is totally captivating too on screen. She's so lovely and a fantastic actress. She and KSH act so naturally that definitely make the viewers to believe they're a real couple. As I said, their chemistry is just great! This «dimple couple» has created an unforgettable screen-sweethearts. So heartwarming scenes of them! The supporting cast are adorable too!The producers, the very delightful script/plot, the beautiful cinematography, the admirable soundtrack/OST, the director's fantastic job, the enchanting setting, the commendable film crew/production team and all the lovesome actors and actresses make «Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha» a huge success! Congratulations!"
tt14518756,I loved this drama from the first frame to the last. It's a beautiful story and the whole cast is fabulous! I loved every minute!! Very meaningful and healing. Our dimple couple are too cute for words! It's funny and worth watching for sure! Loved it!!
tt14518756,"Honestly, I never thought of that I would like this one, since I was never a big fan of romantics. But this one was just that magical, the interactions between the leads were sweet, never too much and natural, all of these made this series more enjoyable."
tt14518756,"Drama has a lot of great reviews and I can see their point of view, but from a real life scenario how can these situation really happen. I get that dramas bring us to fantasy but the chemistry between the lead actors is fake and it is obvious on screen. Not a top drama as certain scenes are not believable and thus adds to an average review. If you are looking for a romance drama with a some humor that is realistic then this id not the show for you."
tt14518756,"This drama revolves around the romance of the main couple and it was very disappointing. Every obstacle: city girl vs. Small town man, remorseful hero, hero not cultivated enough for the heroine... go from weak to absurdly solved, rashly solved or plainly forgotten.The subplots have no better luck. Sadly, the adorable people from Gonjin are not the neighbours in ""Reply 1988"": It takes some talent to turn an ensemble cast amusing. The singer turned coffee owner, who had the story with the most potential is the one whose story is the most underdeveloped... Silly, silly drama that not even Kim Seon-ho´s charming smile can save."
tt0266697,"Just saw Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and was surprised, to be honest, at how incredibly GOOD this film is. Here is a craftsman (or artist, if you prefer) at the top of his game. Some of the shots are simply incredible; the score is, for the most part, vintage Tarantino selections- and the RZA does a very good job at filling the blanks; Uma Thurman is a great female lead, for sheer presence (and decent acting chops). Even Lucy Liu, who I expected was going to re-hash her Charlie's Angel character, burst on the scene like a flaming nunchuck.The stringing together of the scenes was impeccable. The transitions, the intercutting between dialogue, the flashbacks... I simply could not get enough. Tarantino IS, indeed, having fun here. He is giving us a film that may not go down as a classic, Pulp Fiction style, but that shows us what is yet to come. I doubt that he's lost his writing talents (as some have claimed), and I actually disagree that the dialogue in the film is ""poor"", or that there are ""no memorable lines"" (Empire). The kung-fu genre has never been a particularly good park to display Shakespearean writing virtuosisms. The lines work fine. The plot is simple enough, but Tarantino takes a burger and serves it as ""steak tartare with sauce au poivre and asparagus terrine"". He basically manages to cram so much information into the film that plot is simply irrelevent. What is relevent is the Bride's thirst for blood, her primal sense of vengeance and our total devotion to her. Bill, of course, is one of the greatest characters to ever NOT appear on screen. Overall, a great movie and an example of how a filmmaker's tool is not his pen: it's his eye."
tt0266697,"Pros:
1. The bright colour palette does a wonderful job at highlighting the over-the-top nature of the film.
2. The entire animated sequence of the O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) origin story is gorgeously animated, as well as being impactful and brutal.
3. The score envelops the movie in a pulsating lively aura, and adds reems of energy to the scenes.
4. The action and fight scenes are incredibly entertaining and brilliantly choreographed.
5. The editing is mostly top-notch, especially with the quick cuts adding a lot of vibrancy to the fight scenes.
6. The costume and set design create the outlandish world perfectly.
7. Both Uma Thurman (The Bride) and Lucy Liu deliver great performances.
8. The sound-mixing is very crisp and clean, and it adds so much weight to the action scenes.
9. The make-up and art production is off-the-charts and, in regards to the gore, helps to make the deaths to feel more potent in their execution.Cons:
1. The slow-motion used is extremely unattractive and pointless.
2. There is annoying minor usage of stock action screams."
tt0266697,"This is movie is unusual, but it works for me. It kept me intrigued from the beginning with the plot which is not entirely clearly, but that made it more interesting for me. There's a lot of action in the movie which I found excellent and enjoyed a lot. It might not be realistic, but its a movie so it doesn't have to be. The plot is amazing and I can't wait to watch volume 2 soon because of how intriguing volume 1 was."
tt0266697,I like how she wears a yellow tracksuit and chops people with her sword
tt0266697,"I can't explain why you like this movie so much. I don't know how rare this feeling comes to me. Actually this happens only for this movie. I don't know how can I explain why I like this movie so much. I don't like that much Samurai movies, I don't like that much Gangster movies. I don't know how this movie effected me this much. Is it revenge? No it doesn't have the greatest Screenplay.I really don't know why. If someone would say ""This movie is so nonsense, they're in modern times, so why are they fighting with Katanas? At least for not dying they could use guns."" I would agree and can't argue.Tarantino made an amazing Collage with this movie. But the things is I wasn't familiar with those, at least not one by one. So that's also does'nt explains completely why I like this movie so much.So it could be the technical aspects. Right?Yes it could be but I don't know any other movie that I rated 10 without amazing storyline.Revolutionary acting scenes could be the reason.Or maybe just the brilliant chosen Scores carries the movie?I don't know there are so many things that could be the reason. I think all of them effects the movie positively. It has simple but effective screenplay that based on revenge. It has great action scenes, great technical aspects, great scores. Most importantly it is the Collage of so many things. It's the only movie that brings you the taste of Western with Samurai movies and so many more. Still I can't say why I like this movie in one sentence but I think the biggest reason is the great Collage."
tt0266697,"Having seen Tarantino's 3 previous films, going into the cinema, my expectations for 'Kill Bill' were already over the roof. However, regardless of my high hopes for quality entertainment, I was not prepared for this film. I was dumbfounded. I was blown away. I had quite simply never seen anything even remotely like it.In 'Kill Bill', the revenge plot serves only as a larger story arc, thus allowing Tarantino to play with as many different genres as he likes, and boy - what a mix he dishes out! With complete disregard for the conventions of filmmaking, he paints an expressionistic masterpiece in his own unique style, the likes of which the world has never seen before. Cinema rarely gets this exciting. With 'Kill Bill', Tarantino proved once and for all that all the hype around his persona is justified: he IS the most daring, original - and entertaining! - filmmaker of his generation. Simply amazing: 10 stars out of 10.Lesser-Known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget And B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/All-Time Favorite Films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/"
tt0266697,"It's a hefty price to pay, preparing for your wedding day, as your jilted lover Bill, arrives in time to maim and kill, left unconscious, comatose, muscles wasting, decompose, four years later you awaken, and you feel a little shaken, so you start to wiggle toes, then start looking for your foes, there are several scores to settle, you know how to use sharp metal.The Bride starts to track down her past acquaintances and leaves them under no illusion how cold her revenge can be when it comes to finding the whereabouts of the titular Bill. In the style of several classic film genres from several countries, if the pursuit of ultra-violent and vicious vendetta with serious loss of blood and body parts is your thing, then you've come to the right place. Also contains great dialogue."
tt0266697,"A lot of people have come up to me and said ""How can you love Quentin that much, he is just too extreme!"" or ""Oh come on, Kill Bill is just SO not realistic.."" Yes. No.Mr. Quentin Tarantino is rather extreme, yes, and it's lovely! And No. Kill Bill is not realistic, but it's not meant to be realistic! Just like... Lord of the Rings, that's not realistic either! But because it has clear unreal elements, like wizards, it's acceptable?You don't go to see Kill Bill, or any other Q.T-film to see ""Stepmom"", in the same way you don't go to a Marilyn Manson concert hoping that they will play some Spice Girls..Kill Bill, both volume 1 and 2, is absolutely gorgeous! The art direction is beautiful! The camera angles are perfect... just Gorgeous! The lighting, the sound, the dialogs... and of course, the details! No one works with small details the way Quentin does. I must also say that the soundtrack is brilliant and the whole film is just so well casted! Uma Thurman is perfect in the leading role, Darryl Hannah has never been this good before, ever! And Chiaki Kuriyama, even though she has a quite small role, is excellent, even better than she is in ""Battle Royale"". David Carradine is painfully perfect, Michael Madsen is ALWAYS excellent, but never as good as when he works with Tarantino. I must also say that Sonny Chiba was great. I've never been a big fan of Vivica A Fox until now, and I used to think that Lucy Liu was just your average actor but she turned out to be fierce. Pretty much everyone who is in this film is ten times better than they've ever been.But above all things, Kill Bill is artistic, beautiful... Perfect colors, perfect everything... gotta love it."
tt0266697,"I know it's a couple years late, but I had to write a review for some of the few people that haven't seen one of my favorite and refreshing I've seen over the last few years. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is yet another quality film of Tarantino's short, but distinguished list.Kill Bill involves a nameless woman (Uma Thurman) who is slowing seeking revenge on her former hit squad the Viper Squad and her boss Bill (David Caradine.) Her former hit squad wronged her by gunning down her closest friends and family during her wedding and putting her into a coma while being pregnant. A few years later she awakens in a hospital, without child, and tries to track down each member of the squad. As the story progresses (through this film and the sequel), you find out who she really, why Bill wanted her dead and the fate of her daughter.The movie is really a combination of Tarantino's love for the 70's over-dramatized Kung-Fu movie era and story of revenge with rich dialog. Yes, this movie is violent, but in a cheesy way. This created some controversy and really had audiences stirred up, failing to realize it was supposed to be over the top without no sense of realism. Like I said, it was supposed to be a tribute more so than a gruesome action flick. With all cheesiness aside, I can understand how some people could feel a little woozy after seeing someone lose an arm and having 4 gallons of Kool-Aid red blood shoot out of the body like a whale's blow hole. What really makes this movie is Tarantino ability to make bad to mediocre actors seem like good ones, a smart and hilarious dialog and a good storyline. Of course, this is what he does in pretty much in all of his movies.There are various plot holes in the story, but we are really meant to ignore them unlike most movies. Just like the gory scenes, come to grips to the fact that the most of the implausibilities are there just to fill in the gaps of the movie. The movie also features a couple of classic Tarantino showdowns, including an unforgettable one with the Japanese infamous crime lord, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Lui.) Once again, Tarantino puts his imagination at work again in his story telling by using some of his old techniques like jumping timelines and some new ones like adding Japanese animation for character backgrounds.I wouldn't really recommend this film to someone who is really not from the Pulp Fiction era. This film is really just homage to flicks that frequently appear on Sunday Samurai Showcase, revenge and Tarantino's continuous fascination with Uma Thurman. This film contains extreme violence and sometimes strange dialog coupled with some pretty good acting and directing. If you're not a fan of Tarantino's films, you should pass on this one because it is doesn't stray to far from his other stuff. If you like his other works, this is a must see due to its originality and quality. And, if you just don't like Tarantino himself, and find him annoying like everybody else, I don't blame you but it's still worth your while seeing."
tt0266697,"I did not realize it's been that long until I wrote the title for this review... time flies. But the good thing about it, is that Kill Bill doesn't feel dated. I guess that's the advantage of making an homage movie with elements that are purposefully reminiscent of old movies... the final result is pretty timeless. This is pure Tarantino having fun creating something straight from Wire Fu and Chambara movies I'm sure were part of his childhood. Other movies may have more impressive fight choreographies but to this day the Lucy Liu / Uma Thurman fight is one of the best executed: pacing, cinematography, music... just perfect. Highly recommended as a classic Tarantino that doesn't age."
tt0266697,"It's a good movie but with loads of gore and guts . It's a typical Tarantino film , several murders , fights and plot twists . The film mingles martial arts , Hong Kong movies , Spaghetti Western , action movies with Japanese Manga or anime .Uma Thurman is wonderful and overblown . Uma came up with the film's opening shot of her beaten up and wearing a wedding gown . Her struggle with the enemies is incredible , the training with the master ¨Xian Ping¨ has been extraordinary , likeness to Matrix . Although numerous scenes were done by Zoë Bell , Uma Thurman's stunt double , as the shot where the Bride splits a baseball in two with a samurai sword was done for real on the set . Luci Liu is also unbelievable , her performance is breathtaking , as well as the fighting against Uma Thurman . Support cast is frankly well , such as : Vivica A. Fox , Daryl Hannah , Julie Dreyfus , Michael Madsen , Kuriyama , Michael Parks , James Parks , Michael Bowen and Sonny Chiba as the old master . David Carradine makes an invisible intervention , his acting stays for the second part .Interesting and stirring screenplay , according to Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman the idea for doing ""Kill Bill"" began during the filming of Pulp Fiction (1994) , the two began talking about the kinds of movies that they would like to do and Quentin said he would like to do a 70's style kung-fu flick . Thrilling and moving musical score by RZA. Colorful as well as evocative cinematography by Robert Richardson . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Quentin Tarantino . Rating : Above average."
tt0266697,"I cannot believe that people genuinely enjoy this movie.  I was yearning for the exit after the first 20 minutes.  And yes, I am familiar with all of the movies that Tarantino is straight RIPPING OFF and I enjoyed them.  This ""film"" has absolutely no narrative.  It has no value.  It stinks.  Go rent a best of asian action movie and a couple of anime flicks.  You'll have a better time.  I swear.  This movie SUCKED!"
tt0266697,"Like many of Tarantino's films, this movie features exaggerated, action-packed, and gruesome fight scenes, but with a darkly comedic element. The main plot of this film is an anonymous woman who is referred to as ""The Bride"" is shot by a man named Bill, with whom she used to be acquainted with. She is then in a coma for four years and when she awakes is fearless when preparing to fight Bill and the other members of his Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. While it is in the style of a classic, action-packed thriller, this movie is anything but ordinary. With exaggerated and comedic, but still suspenseful fight scenes, intelligent dialogue, stellar acting, and more this is a must-see for all Tarantino fans, martial arts movie fans, action movie fans, and anyone else who wants to enjoy the first two of four hours of purely entertaining from start to finish action."
tt0266697,The music first is breathtaking. The action is mind boggling. The animation is something magical. I am going to see all of the Kill Bills. Uma Thurman redefines herself and every woman alive. This is Wonder Woman times 10. Bravo Terrantino you deserve kudos for this majestic work.
tt0266697,"Man, what a film. As a fan of 70's martial arts movies, it was great to see all of the references. I also thought the use of B&W throughout was extremely effective. The cartoon sequences seemed a bit much, but did fit in with the overall feel of the film. I have seen many people posting about the sheer amount of blood and guts, but you have to remember this was Tarantino's homage to Bruce Lee-era action pictures. In those movies, the stories were very similar epics of revenge, and they never had much of a budget for good ""gore"" effects. It was more or less ""throw some fake blood on the guy who just got killed"" type of effects, which were duplicated accurately by some of the deaths in this movie. The plot also followed closely the plot of most 70's Kung Fu movies; something despicable happens to the weak hero (whole village razed, family slaughtered, etc..) and the hero goes away for years to learn the secrets of a particular style of Kung Fu. All of these movies contained the ""secret move"" which the master normally does not teach, except of course, in this rare instance. That move, as depicted in Kill Bill Vol. 2, is always used on the evil leader of the clan whom had brought death and chaos to the hero.Kill Bill was a terrific modern take on those movies which were always set in ancient China. I was very impressed with Uma Thurman's swordplay, at no point did I feel that it looked scripted or fake. Even when fighting against more than 50 Crazy 8's, it replicated admirably the incredibly one-sided fights from some of the best martial arts movies made 30 years ago.All in all, a great and original film! R."
tt0266697,"Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) is a unique film. I've never seen anything quite like it. My commentary for this film is almost all positive. First off, the cast really blew me away, each and every actor did a great job with their respective roles. Uma Thurman is a terrific actress and she was definitely the right choice to play the lead character. Thurman commands this role and you are transfixed by her in every scene she's in. It's not just the action sequences that she is great in, she's just perfect for the role all around. And it wasn't just her that I loved, I also liked Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Lucy Lui. They all showed off their acting chops here, especially Fox, I personally loved her short time she's in the film. The writing is well done, I especially enjoyed Thurman's dialogue, the well written dialogue and the impressive way that she delivers that dialogue all comes together to make something great. I think most movie goers will enjoy this acclaimed movie, as long as they're not too conservative that is. I say that because the violence is truly graphic and very bloody, but in a strange way it kinda works for this one. I'm usually not a big fan of that, but here it works. Good job Tarantino! 8/10."
tt0266697,"Sure it's outlandishly violent and bloody. Can anyone expect Tarantino's movie not to be a true mind-blowing, adrenaline-pumping shocker?  Of course not!  Gritty and slick, his first installment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the '60s and '70s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror. It's impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros.' iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the `Carrie' blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride's gory face as she's introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death. Or is The Bride 'Just another little Western girl playing at being a samurai' - as O-Ren Ishii blatantly puts it?This film's a sampling of the Tarantino 'fury,' short of the Tarantino customary fiery tongue. It celebrates the Tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computer-generated CGI special effects. It's almost as if I'm watching a colorful and bloodied kabuki stage that's displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multi-layered kung-fu and female samura sword-fighting styles to dazzle the audience. It's examining how Tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favorite 'old-school' filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film. Yep, there's a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film. Powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten. Violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt, and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful. The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. They set the moods so appropriately with the events.
Even at 'The House Of Blue Leaves', we get to see Tarantino weaving the artistic styles of Lucio Fulci, Chang-Che, Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou and Busby Berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur. The themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong. Every camera shot and scene seems to scream out, non-stop, `Kill Bill and all of Bill's DVAS members.'  My adrenaline's still flowing as I'm recalling the scenes. Tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts. A+"
tt0266697,"Brutal and kick-ass. Kill Bill really brings it all from a fun and iconic score, to some savage action that leaves you wanting more.
Kill Bill has an extreme lead protagonist with Uma Thurman as The Bride. And finally, we get a character who doesn't have extreme plot armor, fails and gets back up, and has true challenges and threats. That all combined gives you a lovable character that has you cheering for her for the entire film.
On another note, the cinematography and editing merged with the vicious, blood soaked action is something to be cherished. It's so simple in its execution, yet there are some really beautiful shots and scenes in this film that stick out so much.
The black / blue silhouetted fight scene is definitely one of my favorites. There's even a short animated sequence in this that threw me off at first but really fits in snug with the rest of the film.
All in all, I think it's safe to say that Kill Bill officially is one of my favorite action films now. Simple in the best way possible, giving light to some brilliant performances, an iconic score, and some fun, brutal action."
tt0266697,"Quentin Tarantino is certainly a cinephile's director. Many of the reviews that gut this film laud his abilities and his other works. An undeniably distinctive auteur, Tarantino is often criticized for self-indulgence, but that is what makes each of his works feel like a monument to a vision.""Kill Bill"" feels like a schoolboy's dream about an unstoppable protagonist who faces impossible odds. Take Bruce Lee's ""Enter the Dragon"", infuse it with the stylistic sensibilities of anime, and accent it with pop culture references, especially some strong musical numbers. The result is a personal saga that is the stuff of mythology.Uma Thurman is the nameless protagonist who virtually rises from the dead to seek a vengeance of desolation and mutilation. A perfect blade is fashioned for her mission, and it amplifies her lethality. Thurman gives a multi-leveled performance full of emotion and cold determination. She faces some strong adversaries and their minions, and she suffers through the terrible toll of her quest.Stylistically, KB plays with slo-mo, bold colors, silhouettes, and ""Crouching Tiger"" physics. Tarantino uses angles and viewpoints effortlessly.In one of the film's best moments, Thurman faces off against Lucy Liu, circling to the strains of Santa Esmerelda's introduction to ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood""---one of the greatest dance tracks of all time. In a less subtle scene, she takes to the dance floor in a break-dance killing frenzy to ""Nobody But Me"" by the Human Beinz.A major question for each viewer is: how much gore is too much? Tarantino never shies from depicting carnage and dismemberment. In fact, he glorifies it in this film which, for my sensibilities, is an unnecessary distraction and a tasteless extravagance. In one scene he creates a literal bloodbath (bath of blood). Consequently, this film is not for everyone."
tt0266697,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece-an adrenaline-fueled revenge epic that redefines the genre with style, flair, and unapologetic violence. From the moment the iconic yellow jumpsuit-clad Bride, played with fierce intensity by Uma Thurman, bursts onto the screen, audiences are thrust into a world where honor, vengeance, and artistry collide in a stunning ballet of blood.Tarantino weaves together a stylistic tapestry that pays homage to a plethora of genres-from martial arts films to spaghetti westerns-while maintaining his signature blend of dark humor and poetic dialogue. The action sequences are carefully choreographed to perfection, showcasing breathtaking sword fights and explosive showdowns that leave viewers both exhilarated and breathless. The sushi shop showdown is a standout moment, where Thurman's unstoppable fury meets a cadre of masked assailants in a whirlwind of expertly crafted combat.Cinematographer Robert Richardson captures each scene with a striking visual aesthetic, alternating between vibrant colors and shadowy noir vibes, enhancing the film's overall impact. Coupled with a pulsating soundtrack that seamlessly ties together the narrative, every scene is a work of art-each frame begging to be paused and appreciated.Tarantino's talent for character development shines through. Each member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad is more than just an adversary; they are richly drawn figures with their own unique stories and motivations. David Carradine's enigmatic Bill looms large, a haunting presence that adds depth to the unfolding drama, and his relationship with the Bride is layered and complex, setting the stage for the ultimate showdown.""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" is not for the faint of heart-its brutal violence and graphic imagery may challenge some viewers, but for those who embrace it, the film delivers a cathartic experience unlike any other. As the Bride embarks on her quest for vengeance, the audience is taken on a wild ride filled with jaw-dropping moments, unexpected twists, and an empowering narrative of resilience and determination.In a world filled with cookie-cutter action flicks, Tarantino's bold vision breathes fresh air into the genre. ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" is a kaleidoscopic explosion of style, substance, and savagery-an unforgettable cinematic journey that demands to be seen. This is more than a film; it is a declaration of vengeance wrapped in a stunning visual feast. Whether you're a seasoned Tarantino fan or a newcomer to his work, ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" is an essential, badass experience that will leave you craving more."
tt0266697,"Before you jump to any conclusions after reading the title of my review, let me clear a couple things up. One, I usually love Tarantino--his directing, writing, the films he's produced, etc.--and two, the reason I didn't like Kill Bill Volume 1 had nothing to do with not liking the fight scenes or violence/gore. I love that stuff and that's the only part of the film that I found even mildly entertaining.Instead, the problem with Kill Bill Volume 1 is that it is extremely boring, almost completely lacks suspense, has awful pacing, and makes a number of self-indulgent stylistic missteps. I say ""almost completely lacks suspense"" only because of the first, relatively short section, where Uma Thurman's character, a former ""hitperson"", fights with another of the same kind, played by Vivica A. Fox. Suspense arises here because we don't know who the characters are yet, we don't know anything about the plot, we don't know what their motives are, etc. There is a sense of venturing into the unknown, where anything could happen.However, after this, Tarantino chooses to cling too tightly to his beloved device of non-sequential story construction, and the bulk of the film concerns Uma Thurman's attempt to take down a character whom we already know she has killed. That saps all of the tension from the rest of the film and makes it plod along as a fulfillment of something we're already aware of. It has all the drama of listening to your spouse tell _that_ story for the fiftieth time, this instantiation being filled with enough detail to take up an hour or two, and you're trying to read a book while they're telling it.Yes, Tarantino references tens of other films and genres in a ""homage"" that geeky fanboys can have a party game with--the one who names the most receives a free graphic novel and a case of Hawaiian Punch. Who cares? That in itself doesn't make Kill Bill a good story any more than a pointless clipfest of those films would make a good story. There is a reason that DVD's consisting only of promotional trailers aren't usually bestsellers.Yes, there are some interesting shots and intriguingly blocked scenes in Kill Bill. However, there aren't enough of them to make the film succeed if looked at merely as a series of images rather than a story.And yes, as I mentioned, I thought the over-the-top violence/gore was entertaining. If looked at isolated from its context, Quentin almost outdoes Sam Raimi ala Evil Dead here. However, and this is a big however due to having to consider context, Raimi's gallons of blood worked much better-because they were in an engaging, suspenseful story. In Kill Bill, the violence was almost boring.In an effort to be ""retro hip"", Tarantino includes a number of elements that blend with the film as seamlessly as President Bush in an Iraqi mosque. These are ubiquitous and varied, ranging from the stilted dialogue in the kitchen scene near the beginning (and this coming from someone who usually writes brilliant dialogue), to the strained inclusion of Sonny Chiba, to the ridiculous presence of a female Japanese band who can't sing or play their instruments--even though they're only trying to play I-IV-V ""rockabilly"" (and by the way, if this is what Tarantino think counts as quality music, what was he doing as a judge on American Idol?), to the almost obligatory occurrence of an anime scene. The latter is there just because Quentin and the fanboys think it's cool. For me, however, it underscores both the problem with most anime and with Kill Bill--yes, the subject matter, the violence, the attitude, etc. are interesting, but the animation, the storytelling, the pacing, and just about everything else sucks, and there are a number of inexplicable stylistic choices (such as the Caucasian-looking, big-eyed characters in anime). 'Forced' is probably the best way to describe the plethora of references and stylistic decisions in Kill Bill. Even the foot fetish stuff didn't work for me this time around, and I share the fetish with Tarantino. I'm not usually one to recommend tempering self-indulgence, and I suppose it doesn't matter anyway, since at this point people are going to love Tarantino films just because they're Tarantino, although if this film were made by anyone else, it would have earned the reputation of the 1998 Jeremiah Chechik-directed The Avengers instead. But if this is a sign of the quality to come, if Quentin is going to make further films that amount to laundry lists of all the stuff he likes _just because he likes it_, like a mega-budget mix-tape for a new girlfriend, I'm not watching any longer."
tt0266697,"It has been six years since we have seen a movie from one of the world's most talked about directors, Quentin Tarantino, but the wait for me, has been worth the while. Tarantino can now add the martial arts masterpiece 'Kill Bill' to his resume, a film that left me speechless after I had seen it.  It certainly is one intense, hateful movie, containing some of the greatest sword fighting sequences ever filmed in a movie. Tarantino has made KB with class, precision and close intense attention to every detail. But, what else should we expect from a movie freak, like Quentin Tarantino?An entire wedding party is slaughtered during a dress rehearsal in a rural chapel: the pregnant woman in the blood-splattered wedding dress is Black Mamba, better known as 'The Bride'. The assassin, Bill, and his circle known as 'The Vipers' leave 'TB' for dead, however she was merely comatose. Four years later, 'TB' suddenly awakes from her coma, ferociously focused on one mission, to seek revenge on her former master. One by one, she will kill the various assassins. She is saving Bill for last.I am not sure where I want to start with my review of Kill Bill. I love parts of it, but then find other parts to be extremely difficult to watch. Quentin Tarantino has written and directed another powerful piece of cinema, in a way that only he could. This time we see more violence, the action and the result of that violence, with it being a bit over-powering in the end. But without the violence, KB would have not been the movie it was.This time Tarantino has not focussed on the dialogue in this movie, when it came to writing its script, more he wanted to show what the characters he had created, and why they were in the position they were in. For me I can appreciate both aspects of what Tarantino shows, as he can express himself either visually or with dialogue.The other part I like about KB is the way Tarantino dedicated the movie to certain aspects of cinema history. To quote Quentin he said Kill Bill is 'my yakuza movie, my samurai movie, my spaghetti western movie', and it was quite clear for me how passionate Tarantino was in showing these parts. However it was also so much more, with one of the great sections of the movie being presented in Japanese animation. I also believe that there was a clear reference to black and white movies and silent movies, as KB had these sections a few times. I also feel that Tarantino is in some way trying to show his appreciation to Pulp Fiction, the movie that made him successful, via KB. If this is true, I do not feel it is gloating, rather I give Tarantino great praise, because some movie makers ignore the movies that give them success, but not here.While 'KB' has some interesting characters, none are what I would call 'likeable'. 'The Bride', aka Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) is a girl totally driven by the desire to get revenge. Thurman really suits her part well, as she not only looks attractive, but is really believable as this American martial arts tough girl. Helping 'TB' on her quest is Samuri sword expert Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba). This character brings a very oriental feel to the movie, something I liked. The bickering with his assistant was fun to see being played out.'The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad' are the cruel callous people who inflict horrific harm on 'TB'. Bill (David Carradine) is their leader, a person we only hear and see in hand gestures, which is reminiscent of Marsellus Wallace in Pulp Fiction. Bill still has a very strong presence in the film, even though we never see him. Under Bill are killers like O-Ren Ishii, aka Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu), whose introduction, via the Japanese Animation, was great. Under Cottonmouth is her personal assistant, lawyer and translator, Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus), who was present at the slaughtering of 'TB'. When 'TB' sees Sofie once again, she is pretty bitter about what Sofie let have happen to her. What we hear has happened to Sofie at the hands of 'TB', is truly unbelievable.Another of Cottonmouth's women is a little girl, Go Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), who is more deadly than she looks. Her school girl sound and look is very interesting, while her confrontation with 'TB' highly entertaining. Then there is the evil nurse, Elle Driver, aka Californian Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah), who shows very little emotion towards 'TB', other than hate. Vernita Green (Vivica A Fox) is another woman that 'TB' has on her hit list. Her demise was highly entertaining to say the least, again reminiscent of Pulp Fiction.All the scenes with fighting in KB are a highlight for me, especially the sword fighting, as they are so fun and intense, with the last hour of the movie purely exhausting, with the final showdown between 'TB' and Cottonmouth & co. being terrific. The middle section of film was also great, as it tells the majority of the KB Vol. 1 story, although parts are pretty disturbing.Kill Bill is another film by Quentin Tarantino, where I have to say it was 'exceptionally well made'. There is a scene in Volume 1, which reminded me of 'Matrix Reloaded'. Now I have heard that Tarantino hates the Matrix franchise, and you can see what he is making a stand against, film's laden with SFX. KB is 'not guilty' of being that. The violence is very graphic in KB, but at certain times the violence was 'laughable', as it seemed to look deliberately fake. But perhaps I am wrong? Volume 1 ended at a good point, setting up the conclusion, Volume 2 beautifully. So Kill Bill: Volume 2, get here, A.S.A.P.CMRS gives 'Kill Bill: Volume 1': 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Film)"
tt0097576,"An army of fascists seek to plunder, an artefact so precious it's a wonder, an archaeologist will resist, using whips and guns and fist, in a treasure of a film, packed with adventure.There are puzzles to be solved and riddles broken, the dialogue's a joy, beautifully spoken, action packed from start to end, returns a massive dividend, engaging all the way, and thought provoking."
tt0097576,"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) is an Action Classic adventure better film than Temple of Doom , is still the best follow up in the trilogy and clever. It is also the greatest sequel of all time. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. I love this movie to death. I loved it as a child and I still love it. After the dark middle chapter it was time for Indy to return to form and more lighthearted fair. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the answer. Not to mention that bringing in Bond aka Sean Connery as Indy's dad was perfect casting. Connery adds his own whit & charm along with Indy's usual counterparts who where missed in The Temple of Doom. Last Crusade also bookends the trilogy well since the artifact he is after is related to God. While ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" isn't by any means what I would consider a stellar film, it was still an enjoyable and memorable theatrical experience, and in my opinion, easily ranks as the best sequel in the series. For all its faults and shortcomings (perhaps most of all, River Phoenix' laughably terrible haircut as the young Indy), the film succeeds in hitting the key notes at the proper moments, thus drumming up enough of the right combination of story and thematic elements, action and humor to make it worthwhile. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that it still pales in comparison to the level of across-the-board excellence that was achieved in the original 1981 movie. Still though, fans of this one will definitely want to pick up this excellent release, of which, throughout the entire presentation, I only came across a handful of things I thought could possibly be improved upon technically.This is probably the best installment of the Indiana Jones series. Raiders is a spectacular introduction to Dr. Jones and his style, Temple of Doom is an awesome Action, Adventure flick! Last Crusade rights the ship again with a go-for-broke production. Everything about it is huge- Jones is saving the planet from the Nazis for the second time. The budget was in place and off went Spielberg to make an epic, successfully. The film is bookended by two of the best things to appear in any of Spielberg's output: A young Indiana ""beginning"" his archaeological career, losing his treasure- just like the opening of Raiders- and being told by the man in his trademark hat ""You lost today kid, but that doesn't mean you have to like it."" and at the end, riding off into the sunset, literally. Such a conclusion could be seen as contrived but it works so well here. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has lots of hand-to-hand combat, action-filled chases, and gun fights. Main characters are in near-constant peril, and one is shot point blank and almost bleeds to death. Minor characters are killed in somewhat gruesome ways, including beheading; a bad guy meets his end in a fairly disturbing scene. There's a bit of kissing/banter, and it's implied that two men have slept with the same woman. Language is mild, and there's ultimately a strong message about the importance of the father-son relationship.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a 1989 American adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, from a story co-written by executive producer George Lucas. It is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. A cult film, still one of my favorite films in the series and the last good Indiana Jones movie we didn't need another sequel after third release. There's nothing more exciting than trying to keep up with the Joneses in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Indy's Nazi enemies are back and have kidnapped his father, Professor Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery), in their effort to locate the sacred Holy Grail. Following a trail from America to Venice to the deserts of the Middle East, it's up to Indy (Harrison Ford) to save his father, save the Grail and save the day in this non-stop, action-packed adventure the whole family will treasure.The chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford makes this movie a stand out from the rest of the series. The story of their father and son relationship wrapped in the search for the holy grail is what makes this spectacular Indy movie, a more meaningful adventure. 10/10 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval"
tt0097576,"""Last Crusade"" is always a joy to watch. At 2hr 7 mins the time just flies by, there is never a dull moment. There is a great variety of action, they manage to fit in horseback, train, car, airplane, boat, motorcycle and tank action scenes. All of these scenes are done at the very top of their class.All the main cast work off of each other perfectly, and there is fantastic chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford as the father/son duo at the core of this film. The real predecessor to Indiana Jones is James Bond, so it makes sense that Sean Connery would play the father of Indiana Jones. But beyond stunt casting, Sean Connery's Henry Jones is a delight, and is memorable in every scene he is in.This film also blends together action and comedy perfectly. It never clashes with the tone and always allows the serious moments to sink in. But when they do a joke, it is legitimately a very funny joke.And how I can go without mentioning the music? John Williams delivers some of the best music of his career in this entry. The music compliments what is going on on screen so well, you could picture the scenes in your mind just through listening through the soundtrack.Where some may prefer ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" for its originality and grit, I prefer ""Last Crusade"" for its refining and perfecting everything the series had set up. The ending of this film is also just more satisfying and exciting than the ending of ""Raiders"". The Holy Grail is the best maguffin of the series, and possibly of all time. There is something inherently legendary about people questing to find the Holy Grail.If you haven't seen this film: WATCH IT. If you have seen this film a dozen times already: go ahead and watch it again. It is always entertaining, exciting and illuminating. What a great way to END a great trilogy."
tt0097576,"Rating: **** out of ****My opinion of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade could be deemed slightly biased. It is the first film I ever saw in theaters and it's also the first movie I purchased on video. I even own the same, worn-down, beat-up copy (and look upon it even more fondly than the widescreen edition, for sentimental reasons, of course) (but nothing beats the pristine quality DVD). I think it's fair to say it's this movie that cemented my love of cinema, the high regard I hold for great escapism, which is sorely lacking from today's cinema; movies that should be fun now drag or bludgeon themselves with relentlessly awful scripts or MTV-style direction that turns relatively simple scenes into chaotic blurs. The Last Crusade may only be thirteen years old, but I think I can safely say they don't make them like they used to.The film stars, of course, Harrison Ford as Indy Jones, the archaeologist/adventurer who's on yet another quest, this time to find his father, who'd been searching for the Holy Grail. Said Dad is played by none other than Sean Connery, whose highly charismatic performance is quick to place this film, acting-wise, above the others in the trilogy by giving Ford a genuine acting equal (let me put it this way, he's only half a notch below Harrison Ford/Indy in charisma and appeal if that tells you anything). The rest of the film focuses on this ongoing journey between father and son (eventually joined along by Sallah and Marcus Brody), complete with amazing action and stunt sequences, clever humor, and nasty (but fun) surprises.The script, by Jeffrey Boam, takes a few cues from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but actually improves upon that story by paying more attention to characterization. The delightful opening scene (all three movies really open with a bang, don't they?); which details how young Indy got his scar, whip, hat, and fear of snakes; makes for a better prequel than Temple of Doom (and any of The Adventure of Young Indiana Jones, for that matter).The story is engrossing because there's a lot of fun clues offered towards the location of the Grail and, thus, there's a lot of engaging little discoveries (love the ""X marks the spot"" scene). I'm quite certain, like with Raiders of the Lost Ark, the plot has a few holes, but they're fairly hard to notice, and I've seen this movie quite a few times, but maybe it's just my enjoyment of the film clouding that up. Either way, it speaks volumes in favor of Spielberg's direction and the performances.Given that action and adventure is the series' selling point, you can expect the thrills and wondrous delight of discovery delivered in spades. The action scenes are terrific (and matched well with John Williams' rousing, memorable score, also the best of the trilogy), the best being a fantastic ten-minute chase sequence on board (and in) a tank, possibly the best action sequence of Spielberg's career. I also loved the motorcycle chase and the Zeppelin setpiece, where the heroes go about dispatching of two enemy fighters in unexpected, but quite hilarious, fashion. The climax, complete with frightening booby traps, is a suspenseful venture into the unknown.The Last Crusade is far more humor-oriented than its predecessors, but part of the movie's effectiveness is that it's able to deliver belly laughs without defusing the tension during the action sequences. Some of the jokes are just brilliant, including one with Indy armed with a Luger in confrontation with a trio of Nazis on board a tank that's even funnier than the swordsman scene in Raiders (well, to me, at least).The supporting cast is all-around superb; John Rhys-Davies is back as Sallah, wonderful as ever and displaying a bit more enthusiasm searching for the Grail than he did digging up the Ark of the Covenant. The late Denholm Elliot also returns as Marcus Brody, the most lovable goof of a museum curator. Alison Doody is interesting as Elsa, the blonde historian whom Indy falls for; a twist involving her character and her actions towards the climax make her not as one-dimensional as she may initially appear. Julian Glover is the best of the main Indy villains, he's far more menacing than Paul Freeman's Belloq and less over-the-top but equally enjoyable as Amrish Pruri's Mola Ram. I also enjoyed Michael Byrne's performance as the Jones hating Colonel Vogel, who relishes in torturing Indy and his father. When it comes to pure delightfully nasty villainy, Byrne is even more fun to watch than Glover.Harrison Ford delivers his best Indy performance (maybe even his best performance, period) in this particular adventure. With the addition of Connery as his father, it reveals a personal side to Indy we haven't seen before. It's his rapport with Connery that separates this film from the rest of the genre. They craft an uncannily touching, funny, and genuine bond. That, coupled with the superb action and thrills, solidifies The Last Crusade as the pinnacle of high adventure summer entertainment."
tt0097576,One of the greatest actor duos of all time. The dynamic/chemistry between Connery and Ford is absolutely incredible and the fantastic writing easily make this installment my personal favorite.
tt0097576,"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is an action-adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg. The film stars Harrison Ford, Late Sean Connery, Alison Doody, Late Denholm Elliott, Julian Glover, Late River Phoenix, and John Rhys-Davies.When Indiana Jones, an archaeologist, learns that his father, Dr Henry Jones, has disappeared while looking for the Holy Grail, he embarks on a journey to get to him before the Nazis.This film is probably the best film in the Indy series and for me this is undoubtedly the best film of the series. The film is very satisfying and rewarding action film and almost ticks all the boxes of how to make an action thriller film.The plot of the film is superb and the execution is mind blowing, the film will keep you intact with it's gripping climax and superb music.Acting was the strongest pillar of the film and the addition of Sean Connery in the cast works perfectly for the film.Screenplay of the film is also good with a great climax and superb end. This is the best film of The Indy Trilogy and a must watch."
tt0097576,"Everything clicks in this action-packed cliffhanger. In his third (and what for years what thought to be his last) adventure, Indy is on the hunt for that ultimate treasure, the Holy Grail. Along the way he must contend with Nazis, a secret brotherhood and, of course, snakes. Sean Connery is a wonderful addition as Indy's father, and the chemistry between he and star Harrison Ford may just be one of the best in film history. The movie is a true rarity in that its attempts to outdo each preceding chase sequence succeed. Though children might have trouble interpreting the plot, this crusade is one people of all ages will enjoy."
tt0097576,"One thing you gotta say for this series: it isn't boring.And ""Last Crusade"" has enough thrills, chills and spills to fill up a few dozen old Saturday afternoon serials.  Right down the line, everything about this film is superb.  Ford and Connery do the father and son routine superbly.  Rhys-Davies returns as Sallah, as does Elliott who plays Brody with as much befuddlement as Connery does his role.  And who can blame him? And the FX: there's so many you lose count.  But don't bother, just sit back, relax and get swept up in the moment.  You can't help yourself but to get into this ""Crusade"".Ten stars.  A classic Ford with a bright Sean."
tt0097576,"Summer 1989. I was 8 years old. I only managed 2 movies that summer, one being Ghostbusters 2 (which blew my eager young mind at the time) and Last Crusade (which also blew my mind). I don't think I could have asked for two bigger blockbusters to choose from. Having been a rabid child fan of Raiders and Temple of Doom all things Indy were fresh in my mind and even as an 8-year-old I truly 'got' Last Crusade.Set 2 years after Raiders, and 3 years after Temple of Doom, Last Crusade opens with a flashback to Indy's youth and an aggravating cameo by River Phoenix in the role. His anachronistic hair, androgynous physiognomy, and that fact that he looks absolutely nothing like Harrison Ford take me out of the film every time, and spoils the long opening scene for me. The opening does nothing apart from establish all of Indy's trademarks (the hat, the whip, the scar, the fear of snakes), which he apparently all got within five minutes. Luckily the film soon jumps forward to 1938 and the opening quickly is forgotten about as shady antique collector Walter Donovan encourages Indy to go after the Holy Grail.With Der Fuhrer also after the sacred chalice Indy must once again face off against the despicable Nazis, rescue his bumbling father (Sean Connery, having the time of his life), and keep one step ahead of Donovan with Sallah and Brody tagging along.There is loads of inventive, exciting action in many exotic, breath-taking locations and all of it is immaculately photographed by Douglas Slocombe in lovely anamorphic Panavision. Even with today's many advancements in movie camera technology you'll rarely see a film as beautifully photographed as this. All very high-key, mind you, the polar opposite of the dark, subterranean Temple of Doom.Now, herein lies my only gripe with Last Crusade (other than River Phoenix) is the fact that it's just too light-hearted. Spielberg expressed regret over the fact that he made Temple of Doom very dark and mean-spirited (which I don't agree with as it is my personal favorite) so he compensated by making Last Crusade more cheerful and bright. It's not an annoying shift in tone, but it could have been balanced out with a bit more blood and gore.Last Crusade makes the perfect end to the real Indiana Jones trilogy. Spielberg really should have left it as our hero, his dad, and his two sidekicks rode off into the sunset. How can you top that? How can you come back from that? But 19 years later he tarnished many reputations and spoiled many memories with the deeply, DEEPLY misjudged Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.It was an amazing film to see as a child, and it's a shame that kids these days are not exposed to anything as good. If you can turn a blind eye to River Phoenix you will surely have a great time with Last Crusade. It's not the Snake Car on the train he ought to worry about, it's the Viper Room on Sunset Boulevard."
tt0097576,"Sean Connery, harrison ford, and the rest of the cast in Great performances, with action sequences, big ethical dilemmas and religious themes, comedy, family dynamics explored, what more could you ask for?"
tt0097576,This is definitely better than the other two movies in the trilogy in my opinion. The plot was intriguing right for the start till the end and the actions scenes were pretty good and thrilling. Certain parts of the plot were questionable such as finding the secret tunnel in the library which felt too easy and not realistic. I liked the character of Indiana's dad who had a good personality which made the movie better and funnier.
tt0097576,"The Indy film I saw was terrible, full of bad humor, jokey villains, horrid effects and witless action.  If there is some great 3rd Indy movie out there, could someone please point it out to me because I'd love to see it.It certainly couldn't be Last Crusade which is a terrible film for so many reasons.  Let's begin at the beginning.  The opening sequence with River Phoenix as young Indy just screams ""CONTRIVED""  By this point the Indiana mystique was so high, someone felt the need to explain many of Indy's trademarks, so in one 10 minute sequence, we get the origin of his hat, his whip, his fear of snakes, the scar on his chin and his basic sense of right & wrong.  If any 40+ year old human being could claim that so much of their personality comes from a single 10 minute incident as a child I would laugh in their face.  Aside from the completely ridiculous nature of the sequence, even getting into the spirit of fun is next to impossible when the effects are so bad... the ""animals"" looked like refugees from Disneyland. When ""Anaconda"" had a snake that bad, people rightfully laughed, yet here people seem to think this makes for good filmmaking.A couple of characters return from the first movie but as a fan I have to ask why?  Did they bring Brody back to act as a mentor to Indy, to regale him (and us) with his exploits as a young archaeologist?  Nope, they brought him back to turn him into a bumbling buffoon.  Was Sallah brought back to act as Indy's contact & right hand man, to help him through strange and exotic lands where Indy may not be able to secure the resources he needs, but Sallah can?  No, he was brought back to make camel jokes. ::sigh::Now as for those famous Indy action scenes: in Raiders, Indy got the snot kicked out of him but always relied on his brains to survive (passing under a truck was a great stunt and a deft move for Indy to take).  In the tank chase here, does Indy's intelligence save him?  Does his skill?  The answer is no, it's pure, blind luck.  And who really thought he was ever in any real danger? Besides how dangerous is a poorly blue screened tank anyway?While Sallah & Brody were reduced to cartoon characters, Indy himself became a joke, playing straight man to his father whose dialogue seemed to come from a TV sitcom, the only thing missing was the laugh track.Of course, the only people more comicly inept that Indy & friends were the Nazi villains.  It's hard to imagine these wanna-be keystone cops taking over a bowling alley let alone most of Europe.  But of course, this plays right into the idea that hapless Indy can't face an actual challenging villain that might require skill and intelligence to defeat since in this movie, Indy displays no skill or intelligence.Overall this movie is a hapless, witless exercise in attempted crowd pleasing that only succeeds in pleasing those hapless & witless enough to accept whatever drek the filmmakers give us instead of demanding real characters, real adventure, real thrills and real humor.So for those of you with a videotape of the ""best Indy ever"" some of you are claiming to have seen, please, send me a copy so I can throw out my version of Last Crusade which obviously has all the good parts edited out."
tt0097576,"""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" was supposed to be the final movie in the ""Indiana Jones"" series. At least that's what director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas said at the time this film hit theaters. But now they've said there will be a fourth ""Indiana Jones"" film. I really don't know if that's a good idea, because the ""Last Crusade"" was a fitting end to a great movie series. Harrison Ford returns for his third go around as swashbuckling hero Indiana Jones, this time accompanied by Sean Connery as Indy's father, Dr. Henry Jones. These two actors work beautifully together as they fight off the Nazis in search for the Holy Grail. Two actors from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" reprise their roles to great effect in ""Last Crusade"": Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah. Alison Doody is the heroine (good or bad?); Julian Glover is the villain; River Phoenix portrays a young Indy at the beginning to see how this character really got his start. ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" not only has great characters, it also has a decent story (taking place in 1938), plus exciting action scenes and special effects. It's better than the second film ""Temple of Doom"" and comes very close to topping the first film ""Raiders"". The ""Indiana Jones"" series should stay right where it is with the ""Last Crusade"" as the finale. Unless Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford can prove us wrong and make a really good fourth film in the series, we shall see. I loved all three movies in the ""Indiana Jones"" series. If the fourth film does gets made, I hope it'll be equally as good as the first three.**** (out of four)"
tt0097576,So how do you return a franchise to it's successful past? Apparently bring back most of the cast from the first movie and the Nazis but add Sean Connery. This movie is as good if not even just a little bit better than the original. The interaction between Ford and Connery is amazing and makes for an enjoyable film. The action and story in this is great. This time (back to looking for Christian artifacts) Indy is out to find his father who went missing while looking for the Holy Grail.
tt0097576,"When the two greatest filmmakers in the world teamed up to create the best action movie of all time - Raiders of the Lost Ark, it seemed unlikely that they could duplicate their divinely-inspired work. After a miss with the entertaining yet forgettable Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade comes pretty close to doing just that.Film history's most profitable star Harrison Ford returns to his signature role in a performance that speaks for itself, and benefits greatly from a gallery of memorable supporting characters. That includes Sean Connery, the grandest of all modern action day movie heroes (and appropriately cast, as the spiritual father of the character is James Bond). Connery plays against that, in a performance that is different than anything he has ever done, and it works. Even so, Denholm Elliott can't seem to help stealing every scene he's in as Marcus Brody, a lifelong friend of the Jones family.This movie stands by itself in the way it deals with spirituality, and is thick with religious themes throughout, without preaching to you. This is a very difficult balance to achieve in any film, and that alone makes the film stand out as brilliant. It is more abundant with humor than the previous two films, without the characters falling into irritating self-parody. Being a sequel, this is a difficult balance to achieve as well. (Look at action sequels such as Lethal Weapon 4).This film stands among the greatest action adventures of all time. I don't know anyone who hasn't seen it, but if you haven't, don't walk to see it. Run."
tt0097576,"This is a must see movie for fans of adventure. It came out when I was seven, but I saw it again recently and must admit it aged really well. A testament to the quality of story, acting, cinematography and oh my, the music!"
tt0097576,"Indiana Jones teams up with his father to try and locate the Holy Grail. Something that the Nazis are again particularly interested in themselves.We didn't know it at the time, but every Indiana Jones fan on the planet presumed that The Last Crusade was to be the final film to feature the intrepid archaeologist. As it turned out, another film would surface in 2008, but casting that aside (as many would like to do), Last Crusade should, and is, judged as the trilogy closer it was meant to be.In 1988 Steven Spielberg was deep into bringing Rain Man to fruition, all thoughts of Indiana Jones had gone by the wayside with the harshly judged part two, Temple Of Doom. In stepped George Lucas to politely remind Spielberg that they had an agreement to make another Indiana Jones picture, Spielberg no doubt obliged and humble, passed on his Rain Man work to Barry Levinson who promptly bagged himself an Oscar for the film. It can be guessed that Spielberg was probably grouchy around this period, but he needn't have worried, because The Last Crusade provided a much needed hit for not only himself (post Empire Of The Sun), but also Lucas (Willow) and Harrison Ford (Frantic).I mention the run up to this picture because it explains a lot on why the film is pretty much a retread of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, something that some detractors find unforgivable. Yet Last Crusade is still an immensely enjoyable adventure picture, with Spielberg proving that he was still capable of a popcorn bonanza. Using the Raiders formula and moving away from the dark flourishes of Temple Of Doom, Last Crusade is actually the simplest film of the three, but still it manages, courtesy of a sparkling casting decision, to become the most entertaining of the original trilogy. Is it better than Raiders? Of course not, but it positively rips along with sparky dialogue and an agenda of cliffhanging suspense like the adventure films of yore.In comes Sean Connery as Dr Jones Senior, and its the picture's trump card, because the magnificent interplay and obvious rapport with Ford (cool as a cucumber) is there for all to see. It's this what drives the film on through the more mundane and picture filler sequences, showcasing two top wily professionals with care and consideration to their craft. The casting of Alison Doody as the main female is a poor one, and one only has to look at her subsequent career post Crusade to see she wasn't up to the task here. Bonus comes in the form of the River Phoenix prologue, Phoenix as the young Indiana paves the way for the jaunty path that Crusade takes, whilst simultaneously giving us a nice little back story from which to launch the adventure.Made for $48 million, the film went on to gross $474,171,806 Worldwide, now that's a lot of people who evidently were happy with Raiders Of The Lost Ark 2! And I gleefully count myself amongst that number. 9/10"
tt0097576,"This was an amazing movie, my personal favorite in the Indy series. Has good plot, a lot of humor, and some emotion too. not to mention plot twists"
tt0097576,"1st watched 4/6/2002 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Steven Spielberg): Fun action and witty dialogue abound in this final(we think...) episode in the Indiana Jones three-some.  What this movie lacked as far as special effects it didn't lack in the witty charm brought to the screen by the pairing of Connery & Ford.  From the very beginning to the end it's hard to keep your eyes of the screen following these outrageous adventures and that's the allure of this series.  This film actually tried to put some serious spiritiual overtones into the storyline by searching for the Holy Grail(the cup that Jesus drank from at the last supper) and the myth that it would give everlasting life to those who drank from it.  There are the usual puzzles and hoops that Indiana has to go through to finish this journey(which make no sense from a realistic perspective), but it's obvious from the very beginning that we're watching an un-realistic hero in a movie and that's okay.  All in all this one is a fun ride for the movie-goer which is the ultimate purpose in this one by the ever-entertaining Steven Spielberg."
tt0097576,"""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" was the third and final instalment in the original Indiana Jones trilogy. Whereas ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" was a prequel to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Last Crusade"" is a true sequel. Apart from an opening scene relating an adventure of the teenage Indy as a Boy Scout in 1912, the action takes place in 1938, two years after ""Raiders"". (In this opening scene we learn how the hero got his nickname; Indiana is not, as I had always assumed, his home state, but a name borrowed from his pet dog).Whereas ""Raiders"" was a great commercial and critical success, ""Temple of Doom"" received considerable criticism, both on account of its dark, gloomy atmosphere and its racist treatment of Indian characters. Steven Spielberg, therefore, was determined to make the third film lighter in tone, closer in spirit to ""Raiders"". Once again the villains are the Nazis, once again the plot involves the search for a legendary relic with mystical powers (in this case the Holy Grail which caused such excitement among King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table) and once again much of the action takes place in the Middle East. (This must be the only Hollywood film ever to be set- ostensibly- in the short-lived Republic of Hatay, formerly part of French Syria and today part of southern Turkey, which enjoyed a brief independence for several months in 1938/9. Most of the ""Hatay"" scenes, however, were shot in Spain, with the ruins of Petra, actually in Jordan, standing in for the temple in which the Grail is housed).The film also introduces us to Indy's father, Henry Jones, Sr. The James Bond films were undoubtedly one of the inspirations for this franchise, and it was possibly in their homage that Sean Connery was cast as the elder Jones, even though he is only twelve years older than Harrison Ford. (That speedboat chase along the Venetian canals also seems to be homage to Bond). Like his son, Henry senior is an academic archaeologist and has gone missing while seeking the Holy Grail. Indy believes that his father is in danger and sets out to find him, a quest that will take him to Venice, Germany and ultimately Hatay. The main female character is Henry's colleague, Dr. Elsa Schneider, a glamorous Austrian blonde whose loyalties are ambiguous.There is more stress on character development here than in other episodes of the franchise, with emphasis being placed on the father-son relationship. The film is not just about the search for the physical Holy Grail. Even in the Arthurian legend the Grail was as much a symbol as a physical object, and today the phrase ""holy grail"" is used metaphorically for anything which is desirable and much sought-after. The film is also about Indiana's search for his lost father and their efforts to re-establish a relationship which in the past has often been strained- the story's metaphorical Holy Grail. Ford and Connery are both good at bringing out this aspect of the story. There are also good contributions from Denholm Elliott as Indiana's bumbling colleague Marcus Brody and Alison Doody as the treacherous, seductively sinister Elsa.After the awful ""Temple of Doom"", ""Last Crusade"" represents a welcome return to form, both for Spielberg and for Ford, who seemed ill at ease in the earlier film but here is back to his old ebullient self. The film contains a better balance of suspense and humour than did its predecessor, much of the humour being at the expense of the hapless Marcus. There are some excellent action scenes, such as the train sequence in the opening scene, the escape from the Zeppelin and the tank chase though the desert. ""Last Crusade"" is a very enjoyable adventure film in the same tradition as ""Raiders"". 7/10"
tt0097576,"This film has all the wit and charm of Hogan's Heroes. With the exception of a clever opening featuring River Phoenix and some charming moments from Sir Connery, it lurches from one silly scene to another."
tt0075314,"Travis Bickle is a Vietnam veteran who cannot sleep at night and just ends up travelling around. To try and use the time effectively he becomes a taxi driver. Things start to look up for him as he works nights and slowly starts to live a little bit. He meets a girl, Betsy, and arranges to see her a few times despite the fact that he is a little bit out of the ordinary  a quality that seems to interest her. His connection to the night allows him to see young prostitute Iris being bullied by her pimp Matthew and he begins to see his role to perhaps save her  him playing his part in cleaning up the sewer that he feels New York has become. However when his view of normal life puts Betsy off him he starts to retreat more and more into the night, looking for meaning in his life and growing more and more outraged by the world he is part of.Hardly the most uplifting of films it is engaging and impressive and truly deserves the reputation it has. Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader have produced a film that convincingly portrays a man cut out of society who has the slightest connection to normality before finding it eroded away. The script is brilliant because the detail is engaging but it is this descent into a very modern type of madness that drives the film forward. Travis has just enough about him that is recognisable that it makes it so easy to go along with the rest of his madness. A major part of this is getting the feeling right about living in a cesspit; a city that seems to have forgotten its way morally  New York is the strongest example but elements of it could be parts of any city I suspect. In painting this world in such a real way, Scorsese has made Travis all the more convincing and, to a point, all the easier to follow in his fall. Like I said it is not a film to morally uplift you but one that is depressingly fair. There is no redemption in this modern world and although it appears that the violence at the end somehow redeems Travis in reality by showing ""society"" accepting his action it drags the rest of us down nearer the world that he hates and has become part of. I love King of Comedy for the same reason albeit in a different world.Scorsese injects a real understanding of the place and a real sense of foreboding into even the earliest scenes. He inserts clever and meaningful shots into scenes that other directors might just have filmed straight and his choice of scene and shot compliments the script is depicting Travis descending into madness. What makes the film even better is De Niro showing the type of form that makes his recent form such a major disappointment. He is outstanding as he moves Travis from being relatively normal to being eaten up from the inside out. His eventual implosion is impressive but it is only as impressive as the gradual slide he depicts over the course of the film. Although he dominates it, others impress as well. Foster stands out in a small role, while Keitel makes a good impression as the pimp. Shepherd is not quite as good but her character was not as well written as the others so it isn't all down to her. Regardless, the film belongs to De Niro and although the quotable scenes are the ones that are remembered it is in the quieter moments where he excels and shows genuine talent and understanding.Overall an impressive and morally depressing film that deserves its place in cinematic history. The portrayal of a city and a man slipping into moral insanity is convincing and engaging and it shows how well to ""do"" modern madness and the effects of the moral void of parts of society. Scorsese directs as a master despite this being at an early stage in his career and De Niro is chillingly effective as he simply dominates the film in quiet moments and quotable moments alike. I rarely use phrases like ""modern classic"" because I think they are lazy but this is one film that certainly deserves such a label."
tt0075314,"Not only one of Scorsese's best films, but one of the best of the 70s. It is very hard hitting, dark and still has the resonance and power to shock. The cinematography is measured and chilly, yet very atmospheric, while Bernard Hermann's swansong score is superb, yet more proof at how amazing a composer he was. The story is unsettling but wonderfully told, and the script is brilliantly written. Scorcese also directs impeccably, while the acting is just excellent. Robert DeNiro gives one of his best performances, the whole film is worth watching just for his performance, that's how good it is, but that's not to dismiss Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel and Cybill Sheppard in the supporting cast for they are just as good while Scorsese's own cameo is genuinely frightening. There you have it, another one of Scorsese's best with a brilliant atmosphere and mesmerising central performance. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0075314,"The impact that ""Taxi Driver"" had in its day hasn't diminished, on the contrary, it has acquired a relevance of Shakesperean proportions. Travis's loneliness is a hyper representation of the same loneliness most humans have experienced at different times in different measures. It is always associated with a nightmare and Martin Scorsese delivers it like a nightmare. Travis, possessed by Robert De Niro at the zenith of his powers, cruises in his taxi enveloped in Bernard Herrman and we, well, we're the passengers and everything looks terrifying and familiar at the same time. Paul Schrader sensational screenplay comes to life with the jolting force of a rude awakening. Like it happens, more often than not, with masterpieces, it signed in a rather direct way the lives of the ones who live it in a movie theater and the ones who made it. Scorsese being the giant that he is, survived it and will continue startling us I'm sure but I also bet that for years everything he did was compared to this movie. De Niro and his ""You looking at me"" became such an iconic phrase that even he himself ended up impersonating it. Jodie Foster awoke the insane devotion of a real life would be killer and New York, the greatest city in the world was shown with its underbelly up. A work of art, a superlative reminder of what film could actually give us and very rarely does."
tt0075314,"A lonely Vietnam veteran who has insomnia spends his nights as a taxi driver in the dirty streets of New York, where he encounters a young prostitute who he tries to help make a difference. This is a very good film and one of Martin Scorsese best (Goodfellas being my fave). An excellent portrayal from Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle the cabbie and good performances from Jodie Foster as the child prostitute Iris Steensman, Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle and Harvey Keitel as a pimp called Sport. You actually get drawn into the isolation and anger that Travis is feeling towards these lowlifes and because of that you really feel sympathy for him. Though after a while the loneliness and the city really starts to haunt Travis's mind, causing violent instincts and paranoia. This film is filled with such memorable lines e.g.Travis Bickle 'You talking to me? Well I'm the only one here.' and the many powerful scenes that stay in your head after it's finished. The hypnotic cinematography is a standout, as if your seeing the harsh & gritty New York streets and twisted people through the eyes of Travis when he is driving his cab. A great screenplay, a stunning score by Bernard Herrmann and a superb atmosphere created. This is a brutally compelling and bleak look at a decaying and corrupt society of the 70's. An unsettling gem of a film. 5/5"
tt0075314,"Did I miss something or this movie doesn't have any purpose?Do people just call this a masterpiece just for the sake of it?I've seen old movies like Clockwork Orange that people consider ""weird"" and liked it and even find this one weirder than that! And the only reason I'm giving a 6 and not a 5 is because of De Niro's acting.With all the ""masterpiece"", ""such a great film"" ""revolutionary masterpiece of a film"" I heard about it I was expecting to be blown away by the story and dialogue, but there's near to no story here other than an incel's journey to being a hero!The dialogue is bafflingly bad and empty, I was expecting great dialogue from this one but it's just not there. Just go and watch the scene with Travis talking to the other taxi driver on the street and see what I mean. It's a 5 minute of nothing. The whole dialogue is ""well I mean.... It's just.... I mean.... well.... yeah.... you know..."". Like what!?The interaction of characters with each other is just awkward.The movie is also a little boring, and don't use that word about movies lightly because I've seen a handful of long movies with stretched scenes and long dialogue scenes and wasn't boring for me but this one is just on another level.And what was that ending? Is Travis supposed to be the hero now? Really?What an utter disappointment this movie was, all these years hearing about it and thinking it's one of the classics and then finally watching it like this..."
tt0075314,"Despite what some might see as limited by technical flaws and/or as an overly simplistic plot, Taxi Driver deserves its critical reputation as a cinematic masterpiece. Some 23 years later, the existential plight of Travis Bickle, ""God's lonely man,"" continues to pack a hard emotional punch. In fact, it's hard to know where to begin when praising the elements of this film - such elements as the dark location shots of a (now gone) seedy Times Square, the cinema verite settings of the cabbies and campaign workers, the magnificent Bernard Hermann score, Paul Schrader's fine script, the memorable performances of Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel, and Peter Boyle all must be mentioned. However, the brilliance of this film is primarily a result of the brilliance of De Niro and Scorsese, one of the greatest actor-director teams in movie history. This is an unforgettable film and rates a 10 out of 10, in my estimation."
tt0075314,"A nicely made dark and majestic experience, see the world through the eyes of a weird taxi driver, as his character progresses from a total embarrassment to a mad dog. The movie sends a clear message about society and human ego, and how a man's pride can drift him into insanity.The mood is nice, a prime example on a classic Noir movie, it builds up and prepares you mentally for the big ending.. an ending that failed to live up to the hype that the movie has built in you.. though it had a short yet exciting action scene the ending is pretty simple and is more about delivering a simple message rather than leaving you amazed or satisfied.The dark comedy in the movie is pretty clear, it shows you how messed up society really is, the movie was executed flawlessly when it comes to cinematic and production, but it will disappoint you at the very end, the ending was just too ""MEH"" to bear, especially after an excellent build of events preceding it, such a pity.I'm sure the movie was a big hit at the time of its release (after the Vietnam war), but I'm not sure it would be enjoyed the same at our current time, so let me put it this way: - If you enjoy a dark Noir mood with nice character development then watch it now. - If you enjoy movies with subliminal messages then add this one to your ""watch when I have nothing else to watch"" list. - If you're looking for a great story with a nice twist to it, I wouldn't recommend Taxi Driver."
tt0075314,"Taxi Driver is one of the best films ever made. This is one of those films that you do not get tired of seeing and every time you watch it you realize a little detail that you have not seen before. Excellent actors, a good director, an impressive soundtrack and a real story are the main appeals of this film.This film is about loneliness, about the isolation of a man in a society full of scum. His objective is to finish with the scum of the streets. The story uses a taxi driver as a metaphor of loneliness and it has some kind of irony because we can see that a city which is full of people can be the most lonely place for a man. The long nights in the city, the night environment full of whores, junkies, pimps and thieves are the main elements of the world in which Travis Bickle lives. Travis is an misunderstood guy who is seeking desperately for some kind of company because as he says 'loneliness has followed me all my life, everywhere' but at the same time he seems not to do anything to avoid his situation and it is seen when he goes with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) to a porn cinema. At the end of the film the character makes real his most violent fantasies, with a look of certain soldiers from Vietnam, and he behaves like this because of his loneliness, his alienation and because he does not find any sense to his life. The violent behaviour becomes Travis into a hero, although he had killed many people and he could do it again. Although he acts with an extreme violence the spectator understand him and the reasons why he acts that way. The soundtrack of the film, which is composed by Bernard Herrmann, inspires some kind of loneliness and sometimes it is absolutely terrifying like in a horror film. This music and the slow camera showing the streets help to introduce the spectator into the world of Travis, to know what he is thinking about.In general I cannot say any negative aspect of this film because I have not found anything bad. Although it is a film of the 70s it is not an old-fashioned movie because the essence of the story, the reality that is shown on it, can be perfectly referred to the current society. This film has the privilege of having made famous the sentence You talking' to me? You talking' to me?' which will remain in the history of cinema. This is an authentic masterpiece."
tt0075314,"Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) is a disturbed ex-Marine Vietnam vet. He's suffering from insomnia, and spends his nights driving a cab. He's sexually perverted, and obsessed with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). On top of it all, he wants to save 12 year old prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster).DeNiro delivered one of the iconic performances of all times. Travis Bickle is one of the standards by which all performances are judged. Martin Scorsese is making a disturbing movie. It can be hard to watch at times. Scorsese uses his camera to maximum effect. As Bickle's mind drift from his co-workers, Scorsese's camera drift into the antacid fizzling in his glass. The grittiness of '70s NY is all there. Jodie Foster is shocking. Trying to watch Bickle can be a very trying experience. It isn't an easy movie. But it is a masterpiece."
tt0075314,"It's interesting to read the reviews by people who really disliked this film. Can we dislike virtually every character in a movie and yet keep watching it, even respect it? I don't have a definitive answer to this, but I was captivated by this film. I get this feeling every time I see films that glorify organized crime. DeNiro's performance so surpasses any doubt as to the content of this film that I couldn't take my eyes off him. Contrary to the critics, his every expression reveals his skill as an actor. While his motivations are confusing, they are his motives. He is an unbalanced war survivor who can't tolerate the cesspool the world has become. I mean, ""What did I fight for?"" His social skills are wasted. When he goes on the date, it's one of the most uncomfortable moments I've ever spent in a theater. The efforts to save a small part of his world is met with disdain and resistance. So he flips out and decides to clean it up himself. He is suspicious of politicians and authority figures. He becomes his own man and takes matters into his own hands. The key thing is that he is true to himself and even though he is a frightening figure, he gets his way. I guess most think he should have been killed. That's not a valid criticism. See this, but be prepared to keep changing positions in your seat."
tt0075314,"Scorsese's best.  Not too many hyper-critical reviews of this film have anything near as intelligent to say about what the director and the screenwriter had in mind when they created this American gem.To those people that have seen it and thought it was ""slow"" or the pacing was sub par, they don't know what they're talking about; ""Taxi Driver"" is about the gradual and eventual take-over of insanity, and not about violence, action-shoot-'em-up 'slash' car chase... or whatever they expected from it.  The modern audience today is expecting everything--comedy, drama, unbearable suspense, spfx--all rolled-up into one-stop entertainment... and no, I'm not anybody's grandfather, or here to tell you that movies were great in my day, but, viewers, lighten up already.De Niro, and the rest of the cast, do a serviceable job in this micro-cosmic window into the life of Travis Bickle--a Vietnam vet--who, true, writes mind-numbing entries in his diary, leads a, for the most part, dull existance as a cabbie, and strikes out with a female political campaigner who, after Travis becomes a hero, discovers she is indeed attracted to unstable, sometimes violent chauffeurs.The rest of this movie's story is for the less initiated viewer; decide whether you've truly become desensitized to sexual and violent content in today's films...  Ah, forget it!  You have to have lived at least some of which goes on in ""Taxi Driver,"" or you've just been plain lucky in this life so far."
tt0075314,"As much as I love Scorsese, Taxi Driver did not appeal to me.For me the film was quite dull and boring with little suspense, drama and extremely slow pacing.I'm intrigued to know why this film was nominated for 4 Academy Awards, as well as its ongoing rave as a classic.Perhaps I missed the point of the movie, as I was waiting it to end from half way through.However I did notice some positives. Firstly it is clear, De Niro's performance as a troubled veteran-turned-taxi driver was masterful, and he showed a clear character development during the film. Another positive for me is the aesthetics of New York, as its darker sides are shown. Lastly the score was one that stood out for me, with relaxing music in scenes of driving.6/10 - a good effort, but too much caution over ensuring not too quick pacing."
tt0075314,I expected more. I would have given more space to the story of the young prostitute girl whom the protagonist tries to help. The relationship between him and her seems to me more important and interesting than that with the woman the taxi driver would like to conquer.
tt0071853,"Monty Python (or John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, Graham Chapman and Eric Idle) brought their brilliant wit and smart humour to theatrical audiences back in 1975 with this nice little gem. If you have never seen Monty Python before it will either change your life and how you look at comedy or you will scratch your head and wonder what is so funny.In this farcical story King Arthur (to me a brilliant performance and played extremely straight by Graham Chapman) armed with his Knights of the Round Table is on his search for the Holy Grail.They come face to face with deadly black knights, killer rabbits and lonely lustful nuns to name a few.There really isn't a low point in the film as the laughs keep coming and ridiculous characters keep showing up. My favourite scenes are King Arthur's sword fight with the black knight (John Cleese), meeting the Knights Who Say Ni! lead by Michael Palin and dealing with the bridgekeeper (Terry Gilliam) of the Bridge of Death.While this is a film from Python about one thing that being King Arthur's quest for the Holy Grail it still to me has the soul of sketch comedy due to silly characters that show up for generally one scene and then you move onto the next character. Which to me is completely fine. I think this group may have been the absolute best at sketch comedy.Last night my fiancee, my sister, my niece and I went and saw this at a theatre, but it was very interactive. They gave you two halves of coconuts and lines to shout out to the screen. If you are a fan of Monty Python or this film it is not just highly recommended it is a must for those people."
tt0071853,"""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" (1975) is a genius piece of British comedy. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:This movie is absolute nuts. First some cautions, though - there is some gore and blood (although so over-the-top is comedic), a few scenes which might be classified as religiously offensive, and a longer scene which is highly sexually suggestive. All these things can be uncomfortable for people that are sensitive to the respective categories and should in that case be taken into account.As for the rest of the movie, it is insane. Humor is usually created when there is a plot-twist that deviates from one's expectations, and in that sense, this movie is nothing but humor. Its sole purpose is to make sure the viewer never stands steady and comfortable in what to expect, and that this the only expectation one can have. If quirky yet brilliant and genius humor like this is appreciated, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is an absolute feast, and make sure to watch the Special Editions that features the short ""Dentist On the Job.""My personal grade: a hilarious 8/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."
tt0071853,"In the Realm of King Arthur, the Monty Python team set out on a quest to recruit the best Knights in the kingdom and find the Holy Grail.This is Classic Python Mayhem, where we encounter Killer rabbits, Knights who go Nee! and Horny Nuns who lure the unsuspecting in with there Grail Shaped Beacon.The Cast all give Typically Hilarious Performances, bringing another must see to the Python Loving Audience.If You Like Monty Python, you'll love it, if you don't then stay away.If you've never seen Monty Python before then give it a try, yes it's dated but its still great fun.9/10Also see, The Life Of Brian and The Meaning of Life"
tt0071853,"Well, this is unquestionably one of the funniest movies ever made. The first time a saw it I laughed to tears and this is the only time that counts. The first time you get the best experience. I really envy those who haven't seen it yet. From the opening scene to the sudden ending this one won't let you leave the room. Especially the opening scene: ""Are you trying to say that coconuts migrate"" or when John Cleese trying to be Tarzan, hanging on the rope said: ""Can somebody give me a push."" An absolute masterpiece.
Considering the low budget that the creators of the movie had at their disposal would probably make ""The Holy Grail"" the best movie in this genre-silly nonsense kind of stuff. It shows the great creativity and acting capabilities of the Monty Python crew. It comes to say that a movie can be made with a little bit of money - a great movie. 10 out of 10"
tt0071853,"I do know, however, that Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the funniest movies ever made. Let's face it, if the Python hadn't showed up in 1969, someone would have created them by now, or the world would be a much sadder place. Alongside Life of Brian, which is the sextet's masterpiece, Holy Grail is an excellent start if you want to get addicted to their surreal humor.As suggested in the title, the film deals with the Arthurian stories, freely reinterpreted by the Python ensemble: after recruiting his knights, including Sir Lancelot (John Cleese), Sir Robin (Eric Idle), Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones) and Sir Galahad (Michael Palin), King Arthur (Graham Chapman) embarks on a mission from God (also Chapman, voice only though): to seek and find the Holy Grail. No need to say, the journey is going to be perilous, but also hilarious, our heroes doing their ""best"" to screw everything up.As in Life of Brian, there are so many good bits choosing just one or two feels reductive and disrespectful, given the material. It's pure comedy gold from start to finish, a non-stop gag marathon: from the mock Scandinavian subtitles in the opening credits to the argument about swallows, from the Killer Rabbit to the Black Knight and the jaw-dropping epilogue, you will keep grinning like never before (if you're unfamiliar with these comedians, that is). Actually, after some serious thinking I can select two particular sequences as particularly memorable: the Knights who say ""Ni!"" and the Bridge of Death. The rest of the film is ace too, but those two scenes are the ones I can't stop thinking of fondly whenever the movie is mentioned.Oh, and let's not forget Terry Gilliam's vital contribution: he doesn't appear that much as an actor (his Bridgekeeper is absolute genius, though), but he compensates that with the remarkable animations used to depict part of this epic adventure. Speaking of epic, this picture has one of the most brilliant tag-lines in comedy history, if not film history in general.Oh yes, the world wouldn't be quite the same without the Monty Python. Even the most miserable person on the planet will laugh like a lunatic after viewing any of their films.P.S. Ni!"
tt0071853,"King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table set out on a quest to find the Holy Grail...as told to do so by a cartoon God that lives in the clouds... Easily the most hilarious and original comedy ever made, Monty Python and the Holy Grail claims it's undisputed throne through insanely ridiculous situations and characters that will very likely never be duplicated. Pure comedic genius that doesn't go stale with age or decades of competition having been released. Simply seeing the way comedy films are made today, this film will very likely have a long reign before anything can even hold a candle to it. An absolute belly-laugh fest that never lets up.Only the cast of Monty Python could have pulled this film off, with each actor playing many different characters...all hilarious! The genius in the actors' lines themselves are truly to be admired. The comedic style of talking in circles is one technique that most comedies do not try to do, simply because they can't compete with the genius of this film, which uses it flawlessly. Those that do try usually fall flat on their faces. Two particularly excellent examples of this can be seen in the beginning scene, in which the characters discuss the origins of coconuts.....and the other when Lancelot breaks into the swamp castle to save the ""damsel in distress."" This is merely one technique that the cast has perfected to conjure up laughs consistently throughout the entire film. The only way that I can imagine that someone might not like this film is if they simply do not enjoy it's type of humor. Too bad for them.Another hilarious technique used in the film is the use of comedy in the background. From people slamming cats against poles for no apparent reason, to people filling up baskets with mud in the fields....all very strange and hilarious at the same time. It's also simply amazing that all of the characters are played by the same group of actors, which shows the great range all of them have. Some are simply unrecognizable from one character to the other and it sometimes takes a good eye to pick them out, which makes it fun. And I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but this film takes some turns that no sane person could see coming.Ridiculous characters in ridiculous situations equals ridiculous laughter.The epitome of all-star comedy that will no doubt continue to stand the test of time. Kudos to Gilliam and the rest of the Python crew. If you haven't seen it yet, make it your first priority in life!"
tt0071853,"This is such a great film that a professor of mine actually used it in a Medieval Civilization class as extra credit. This was not because the movie was so historically accurate, but because the movie was so much funnier when we applied what we learned in her class to it! It was really hard to pick only 10 funny lines!To anyone that watched it once and didn't quite get it or got frustrated the first time, here is a tip: Catch it on DVD with the subtitles or closed-captioning on. That way you will be sure to catch all of the French insults and the other one-liners that fly by so fast! I don't recommend doing that with kids in the room - my 7-year-old picked up a couple of words on the screen that he had missed previously...Enjoy!"
tt0071853,"Whether you love it or hate it, Monty Python is forever etched into British comedy history and this edition of the filmic Python exploits has stood the test of time, just.The thing with Monty Python is that it's very random. The bizarreness and variedness of the humour is really something to behold and there are numerous examples in this film alone which backs this up. Whether it's a completely random and insane discussion-come-argument about swallows to a really scathing, surreal attack on how the English dealt with the 'black death' or the 'plague' or whatever killer virus' were going around back then, in the carefree manner that is shown. It can be a joy to behold.With this film, we are instantly thrown into a world of confusion as the 'projectionist' actually loads up the wrong film to begin with. From here, you know something's up as no other film that I've ever seen or heard of has a beginning like this and you know that this is going to be different. Once the real film has started, the dialogue in the early scenes superbly juxtaposes the setting in 900 odd B.C. as political arguments and, as I've mentioned, discussions about migratory birds pop up. It feels like an extra long episode of a comic, sketch TV programme which has no real plot, but is just a montage of jokes and hilarious situations the characters find themselves in and this isn't a bad thing. The great thing about this is, is that the early situations and exchanges work as a flame for us, the moths, and it sets the stage very well; drawing us into the world of humour on show. Since no one around now knows exactly what happened in the time of the films setting, no one can argue whether any of this would really happen. Were minstrels who followed people/knights around that annoying? What did knights guarding the turrets of castles actually do/talk about to pass the time? Swallows maybe? Effective little scenarios like this make you wonder and it just adds to the genius of the writing.One of the early scenes has to be one of the funniest in films entire one hundred year plus history. This is the fight scene between Arthur and the black knight. Following on from a good fight scene, the black knight delivers some of the funniest lines in the most funniest of ways following his own decapitation. The line: 'All right, we'll call it a draw.' has me in stitches just thinking about it.One quarrel I have with the film is the animated sequences. Now, they look terribly dated and really aren't that funny. Fortunately, they only last a few seconds (most of them) and don't distract you too much but why even bother to have them in the first place? The titles in-between the knight's own separate stories are fine but little things like the 'artist suddenly having a heart attack' just insult the viewer. Not good, unfortunately.I think most people would have a problem with the characters who talk to the screen, breaking the 'fourth wall', something which was stamped out of narrative film-making decades ago. I had a minor frustration with this as although it only happened twice from memory, it spoilt what was a perfectly good/funny scene. The incident in the castle full of young girls is the one which immediately springs to mind as she starts talking to the audience. In an analytical sense, this is actually supposed to add to the experience in the sense that it's all theatre anyway and this film shouldn't be taken seriously. It's fun and farcical and that's all that matters. I didn't let it get away with it when it came to the rating, though.This film's great to watch alone, especially if you've not seen it either before or for a very long time. If you've never experienced Python before, then this is a great appetiser and remember  there are two other films and plenty of TV series' as-well."
tt0071853,"The first 20 minutes are comedy gold, with typical Python intelligence, which means smarts combined with pure silliness in surgical precision, elevating the whole.After that, the movie has 60 minutes of ups and downs, not always overcoming the lack of budget, sometimes overusing the ""breaking the fourth wall"" joke, or just focusing in a less funny joke just a bit too long.Still, overall, it's impossible to say the quality isn't good, because for every bad segment, with get an opposite amazing one. Big step forward from the 1971 film."
tt0071853,"All my life I've heard how funny Monty Python and the Holy Grail was but I had never seen it. Being in college, a group of my friends all wanted to watch it so I decided to join, excited to finally see this movie for which I've heard so much praise. I could see how people find the movie funny but I could not get into it. I kept wanting to leave but was determined to see it through to its end... and actually, I'm glad I did because the ending ""credits"" where it's several minutes of music playing to a black screen was the only thing that made me laugh from the movie. I respect the movie because it so widely loved so I'm not trying to bash it, yet I definitely think, as with any sort of humor, it is not for everyone. There are countless types of humor: dry, sarcastic, physical, nonsense, political etc. and everyone has their own taste as to which they prefer. With a movie like Monty Python, which has a very certain type of humor attached to it, there are bound to be those who dislike it. I only leave this comment to let those of you who have not yet seen the movie hear a ""different"" sort of opinion, as nearly all of the comments here highly praise the movie."
tt0071853,"I loved the movie and I'm not going to go into any detail about the movie itself.  Some people though are knocking the ending, but again still praising the rest of the movie, and I'd like to just say that the ending is just fine the way it is.  Yes, they had planned to have some big storming the castle ending to the film which may or may not have been hilarious; but, they ran out of money on the film (look at the use of coconuts, a real budget would have meant real horses).  The ending that all this is really just a fantasy (so to speak) about a fantasy saga actually is quite funny. Is does end abruptly, but even that is fine in the context of a wacky movie. Just enjoy it and don't harp on the fact that the ending doesn't fit the rest of the movie, it does if you let it."
tt0071853,"Name another context where the line ""your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries"" is funny. If it's not John Cleese as the taunting Frenchman or said in that very same obnoxiously fake French accent, it's about as funny as missing tea time.""The Holy Grail,"" far and away the greatest comedic work of the Monty Python gang of Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam is a masterful example of the power of improvisational humor and satire. It is also testament that nonsense, when executed properly, is brilliance.No comedy can even touch what King Arthur and the knights of the round table's divinely charged quest for the Holy Grail does. Whether it is a rant about various forms of government, a tragically flawed scientific logic for burning witches or knights who keep sacred words like ""Ni"" and demand shrubberies, just about everything in the film is memorable, quotable or at least highly enjoyed by those with bad recall abilities.The Middle Ages is perfect fodder for Monty Python, mixing a definite sense of history with tales of fantasy -- the ideal balance for satire and nonsensical fun. But truly, comedy is about timing and execution and no one does it better. The subtleties of ""I'm not dead yet"" and ""i'm getting better"" are examples. Delivered in another way they could miss the mark entirely, but the Python crew gets just about anything to be funny. A definite improvisational element keeps the scenes fresh and all the more hilarious.""Holy Grail"" nails joke after joke and only lacks a satisfying end. Still, the sheer comedic genius of the rest of the film is so good that the whole unit is meaningless. You don't walk away thinking it's a bad ending, you start quoting the taunting Frenchman, or the leader of the nights who say ""Ni!"" or the Black Knight. That's what makes the film a true classic."
tt0071853,"Well, if you want original humor, meaning something different than what you normally see - this is your ticket. The above statement was true 30 years ago, and still holds. It's just silly, far-out humor.It's not all winners, no comedy is, but there are enough of them, and enough classic bizarre scenes that it's always a hoot to re-visit this film from time to time. The only problem I have with it are the cheap shots in gives - in typical 1970s fashion - of anything Biblical. But, it's not that bad and most of the film is pretty innocent.It's pretty much one ludicrous scene after another. I mean, where else do you see a knight fighting on after his legs are chopped off, then his arms?!! Or a killer rabbit? It was almost like watching a Marx Brothers film 40 years later with '70s irreverence.Don't let the PG rating fool you. This would be an easy PG-13 today with all the blood, some cursing and the violence. I know some young kids, however - nice kids, too - who love this film as much as adults, so it can't be too offensive. If I had to describe this movie in one word it would be ""lunacy."""
tt0071853,"This is how to make a comedy. Laughs can be found throughout, and the 4th wall falls apart throughout the film without any actors chewing the scenery. The movie from the first scene, and on is great. The acting is wonderful. Everybody in the cast delivers the jokes hilariously. Also the the actors never seem to overact at all. There are a few jokes that go on for to long, but it is aware of this. If only another comedy that doesn't deserve to have its name mentioned (cough Disaster Movie cough) was self-aware that the jokes it had were to long. It really is a shame that British people can say that they have awesome comedies like this, and we have a lot of awful comedies like (sigh) Disaster Movie. This film is a work of genius.4 stars out of 4"
tt0071853,"After the brilliant Life of Brian, I was looking forward to watching Monty Python and the Holy Grail. And I loved it, I don't think it is quite as good as Life of Brian, but it is definitely one of the better Monty Python comedies for sheer hilarity and fun. The story like Life of Brian isn't the strongest component but this is in no way a criticism and yes the special effects are cheesy but perhaps that was the intention. My only problem with the film was that the ending is a little flat, but that is a minor criticism compared to how much I loved this film. The script is irreverent and highly quotable, and the soundtrack is even funnier. As a comedy it is wonderfully inventive, that debunks the Dark Ages and legends of chivalry through King Arthur, The Black Knight, God and the ""knights who say ni"". Comedy highlights include the trial with Connie Booth's witch and the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch sequence. Even the sets are quite well designed and authentic. And the acting is simply wonderful, John Cleese, Terry Jones(the encounter with Dennis's mother was hilarious), Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin and Eric Idle perfectly live up to their exceptional talents. Overall, a great comedy and a great film. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0071853,"Hilarious and a movie to last through the ages! This was one I came to late, I was in my 20s before I watched this film for the first time, but boy do I wish I had seen it earlier in life. The comedy in the film is perfect for me, and every line is delivered with the perfect amount of sarcasm and wit. To some this may seem too stupid or silly, but I think it's borderline brilliant. The film has way too many jokes and gags to choose a favorite but to me some of the best are the black night at the bridge, the French, and of course the ""huge tracks of land"" quotes 🤣🤣🤣 I don't want to really give much detail about what the this movie is about because it's just an experience you have to enjoy for yourself."
tt0071853,"To watch this film aptly you must know three things. First, you must expect no overarching narrative. Second, you must realise these characters will be one-dimensional, at best. And third, you must tell me what is average air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow? Pray that you must never cross the gorge of eternal peril. Except when venturing near Castle Anthrax, where the punishment of oral sex with 17-19 blondes and brunettes awaits the foolhardy. Instead sit down, stay still, and appreciate the consistently spot-on sketches from the Python boys.Now for something completely different. This is a mind-expanding film, scathing of the mythology that built these fair islands of Blighty. Classic lines, completely confident, a crew and cast having fun. This is a film to show your grandchildren. Just remember to ask them, ""African or European?"" AAA..."
tt0071853,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a comedy about King Arthur and his quest for the cup of Christ that takes us through many different humorous scenarios up to the ending!! The humor and dialogue are written very well by a cadre of writers who also act in the film including Graham Chapman, John Cleese, and Eric Idle to name a few. Even after nearly 50 YEARS since its theatrical release some of the humor holds, and the movie is simply a stupid look at one of the most important crusades of the crusades. All sorts of humor besides written are used in the movie including physical and prop comedy, really anything that it takes to make its audience laugh!! I think this is why audiences worldwide like this film so much, I liked it but only gave it a 6 out of 10 stars simply because I may be just a bit too young to completely enjoy the film but I did appreciate it. The writing is excellent, the comedic acting is good, the period costuming is fair, the action is good, the limited cartoons are also good, the flow to the film is superb and the only complaint I had about the film again is that the humor might be aging. Still 6 out of 10 stars!!"
tt0071853,"This is going to be an unpopular opinion it seems but I didn't find this film very funny. It had some parts where I chuckled and some bits were clever but also a lot of it was annoying. I usually like silly and absurd films but this one was too random for me to like. Maybe I was not the target audience for this? Or maybe I just didn't understand the humor. Not sure. Either way, the trailer looked a lot more promising than what I actually end up seeing."
tt0071853,"Monty Python will always be loved or hated depending on your personality. And this is Monty Python at its typical best. If you like daft jokes, killer fluffy animals, bad accents and intelligent discussions that will most likely go over your head the first time round, then you will love The Holy Grail.The jokes vary from obvious visual puns (coconut halves to represent horses) and audio puns (""I am Roger the Shrubber"") to more subtle and intelligent jokes (""I thought we were an autonomous collective"" / the Witch-burning scene). The greatest thing about the Holy Grail is that there's something for everyone. No one is left out.What many don't realise is the sophisticated intelligence behind the jokes that many of later generations don't understand (back in the Life of Brian - Romani Ite Domun - which wouldn't have such impact on the youngsters who never had to suffer through Latin classes) such as the witch burning scene, where it was true that any means possible was used to warp the natural and legal laws to create the desired result i.e. one less warty woman in the village, and how the mish-mash of Celtic tribes were suddenly forced to become a diplomacy (""Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony!""). It always reminds me of Blackadder - how so many great jokes were wasted by bad timing or bad judgement on the audience's vocabulary.And for those who can't keep up with historical jokes, there's the Black Knight, Tim, and Zoot to keep you occupied. They sure as hell make me laugh.So if you like daft humour, go for it! But promise to check out the subtle jokes as well. It's worth the effort, and you'll learn a little about history too."
tt0457430,"Set during Franco's mopping up exercise after the Spanish Civil War, Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth is a wonderful, dark fairy tale that, in a metaphor for Spain itself, teeters on the edge of nightmare dreamscapes of corruption, violence and the death of innocents.This film is definitely not for young children. Although the fantasy sequences are gorgeously realised, and are fairy tales in the truest sense (in that they are dark, fey, dangerous and violent), most of the story (about three quarters of it, in fact) exists outside of the dreamland, in the even more frightening (and sometimes shockingly violent) world of a real life struggle of ideas and ideology.Sergi Lopez is excellent as the brutal (and possibly sadistic) Falangist Captain tasked with routing out the remaining leftists from the woods and hills of Northern Spain. Into this precarious situation come his new wife (a widow of a former marriage, who is carrying his son) and his stepdaughter Ofelia (played to absolute perfection, by the then 11 year old, Ivana Baquero).Uncomfortable with her new surroundings, suspicious of her stepfather and desperately concerned about the worsening condition of her mother, Ofelia uncovers a strange alternative world, and the chance to escape forever the pain and uncertainty of her everyday life.Thus the film alternates between the world of Civil War Spain and the increasingly bizarre, dark and frightening world of the Pan's Labyrinth. As the twin plots progress, they intertwine, with the tasks of Ofelia becoming the choices faced by a Spain at the crossroads. The poignancy of the film lies partly in the fact that the victories of the child are reflected so starkly by the failures of the adult world.Apparently Pan's Labyrinth won a 20-minute standing ovation at Cannes, when it was shown. This may be a little bit over the top. I suspect when the furore has died down some will choose to swing the pendulum back and criticise it for its more obvious faults. Much of the film is derivative. There are few ideas in the film's magical dreamworld that haven't been seen before. There are also few ideas in the film's depiction of the Civil War that can't be read in Satre or Orwell; can't be viewed in Picasso's Guernica; or can't be watched in Land and Freedom.For all the evident truth of these observations, to accept them would be to entirely miss the majesty of Pan's Labyrinth, which doesn't lie in its originality but its absolute mastery of execution. People will watch Pan's Labyrinth in a way that most won't watch Land and Freedom. In doing so, they will also discover a world of fairy tales which existed before Disney sunk its claws into them: a dangerous world, where nothing is as it seems and every step is a possible death  a place which may leave even adults shivering under the duvet, part in terror, part in wonder. And all this backed up by the finest cinematography I've seen.The only real faults I am prepared to allow for this film is a slight tendency (particularly at the end) for a Narnia-like moralism, and the fact that the faun is, perhaps, is not quite wild enough! These are eminently forgivable, though. This is easily the best film I've seen this year, and a must see on the big screen."
tt0457430,"I was fortunate enough to catch Pan's Labyrinth last night as part of the 'Fright Fest' programme in London and was completely blown away. Guillermo Del Toro himself was present to both introduce the movie and to answer questions afterwards. He spoke very passionately about the film, and it was easy to see why. Guillermo Del Toro has created something very special - part war movie, part fantasy, that everyone should see. The film features a fantastic performance by Sergi Lopez as Captain Vidal and as central character Ofelia, newcomer Ivana Baquero delivers the performance of a seasoned veteran. If you are the type of person who is put off by subtitled movies, don't be. This is a very 'visual' film that does not rely overly on dialogue. This does not open until 24 November in the UK and 29 December in the USA but already I am looking forward to seeing it again (and buying the Special Edition DVD).This is the first time I've felt the need to write a review on here. Do yourselves a favour and go and watch it on the big screen."
tt0457430,"Few would dispute that 'Pan's Labyrinth' is one of the best foreign language films of the 2000s, but I would go one step further and argue that it's also one of the best modern day fantasy/adventure films in general. There aren't many films that manage to blur the lines between fantasy and reality as effectively as 'Pan's Labyrinth'. The effortless transition between the real world and the underworld and the way the two worlds are interlinked really is something special and I've never seen it done as well before.The combination of a convincing and easy to buy into storyline and the magical fantasy underworld works perfectly. The fact that both parts of the story could easily stand alone without the other, and yet go together seamlessly, is an indicator of just how good it is. The horror elements also bring something completely different and unexpected to the film, though they are tastefully added and never overdone. Overall, a wonderful film and one of the best fantasy/adventures of the 00s."
tt0457430,"I know not everyone should like this movie as I am. I actually don't like this type of Fantasies. I like Fantasy movies that are belong to another Fictional Universe. Making a Fantasy movie in our world were not a great idea for me. But this movie shows you the real world, makes you feel the reality and all the bad things in the world. Then shows you a great land, I don't know like a Heaven. You're traveling one to another. You're seeing another aspect all the time.That is why this movie is so unique. It doesn't bring you another world. Bring the another world to your world. And somehow It manages to doing that so perfectly.Not only these but this movie has amazing fictonal characters. The terrifying villain, the innocent daughter that deserves to see miracles, the mother that doesn't have a choice, the creatures with unique visuals.Acting, costumes, makeups, editing are pretty good. But the Screenplay, Scores and Cinematography are just brilliant. Totally worth to see, you'll see another type of Fantasy with this movie."
tt0457430,"I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I'd be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose 'Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I've seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'Pale Man' - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one's death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.I loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro's greatest work to date."
tt0457430,"An incredibly creative piece of cinema. It incorporates an amazing fantasy world with the realities of war. It gives its protagonist a way of surviving and continuing on with a life after she could have lost everything. The visuality is striking, creating a world like we've never seen. There is an amazing use of computer generated images. Everything in this film is in balance as it shifts between fantasy and the horrors of the civil war under Franco. Del Torro is a director of the first order. If you don't like him, try to realize that he takes chances and there are always naysayers out there who want to tear down that creativity. Imagine Stravinsky stopping after ""The Rite of Spring"" because the Philistines who are stuck in the past couldn't give it its due or at least have some optimism."
tt0457430,"This is a movie with a simple and straightforward plot which contains layers and layers of intelligent writing, metaphors and message.To speak further about the script will end up in spoilers and that would be pointless since my very purpose writing this review is to encourage people to see it.This is no small feat, interpreting fantasy as something of a product of a real world, cross-referencing how the child acts to her real surroundings and the ""other world"", metaphors that describe the accelerated state of growing up some of us are put through... Incredible. Simple, straightforward yet there is so much to be appreciated.Those who are saying how it's predictable and thus not enjoyable, I ask of you, which movie nowadays aren't predictable? Hell, even 21 grams was predictable but so damned good. It's not about how it ends, you can always predict how a movie would end if you've ever taken a half-decent script writing class or have some common sense. It's always about how well you tell a story.I'm grateful there are still directors who aren't tied down to this new epidemic of including a plot twist simply because they need a plot twist.Pan's Labyrinth features some of the best storytelling and attention to detail without being affected by the now ever-popular opinion of cameras having to be put through several technical difficulties to make the shots eligible to be called a brilliant shot.I am also grateful for them not dubbing it. Watching it in its' original language is much, much more rewarding even if I had to rely on the subtitles for most of the time.This is a brilliant movie. Watch it."
tt0457430,"Everyone's been raving about this. My opinion doesn't differ too much. It did however suffer slightly from the overwhelmingly high expectations I'd developed based on how brilliant everyone said it was, and the whole ""20min ovation at Cannes"" thing. Really, who stands for that long? That said, it's an amazing work.Skipping the plot recap (find the briefest synopsis you can if you need to be filled in), I'll go straight to the tech specs. I'm not a huge Del Toro fan, Cronos was interesting but lacked something for me. Mimic was dross. Hellboy was enjoyable and Ron Perlman is always great on screen. But here, the director really outdoes himself. By far. He has wrapped together some amazing elements and somehow maintains a balance, that doesn't tip into the mundane or the ridiculous for a moment. And this is no mean feat. The story is part historical drama, part fantasy, part family melodrama. When it dips out of the fantasy, it still enchants.Sergi Lopez and Maribel Verdú really drive the story in the historical drama scenes. I haven't seen Lopez in anything other than a film called Lisbon, in which he played a character so completely opposite from the Captain. He is a fierce and terrifying guy but actually comes across as sympathetic in a couple of scenes. Verdu is incredible as Mercedes, the head housekeeper (or something) who is Ofelia's closest friend in the house. The scenes with these characters and the civil war subplot never fail to hold your attention. Ivana Baquero is excellent as the main character Ofelia, her performance is very mature and believable and she shares some beautiful scenes with her mother and Mercedes.When the fairy tale elements return, it's astounding how naturally they fit into the story. I think that is the real magic of this film. The war drama and the fairy tale stem so naturally from each other.One thing that most reviews haven't mentioned is the violence. I think it's been firmly established that this is an adult's fairytale, but at times it is a very intense and brutal film. There are a couple of scenes in particular which are very disturbing and difficult to watch. These do not distract from the tone and theme of the film however so they don't seem exploitative at all. If you are squeamish, it may get a bit much for you.A final and obvious point I spose I can't get away without making: the set design, costumes and effects are superb. That's all.I was perhaps expecting a little more fantasy, but the unique blend of genres is absolutely compelling. There wasn't a false note anywhere or a plot hole, which are too often present in fantasy films. I can't recall a good, original fantasy film from recent years. Fortunately this blows MirrorMask out of the water. It doesn't share any of the contrivances, vagueness or ineffectual characters with that film.I just wish I'd seen it without already having read so much. I've tried very hard to not reveal any plot details at all as it does go to some surprising and unexpected places. Fortunately most of the reviews have done the same. I'd urge anyone with the chance to see it to do so immediately, and try not to read too much more."
tt0457430,"I had unsurmountable expectations for this one, and, alas, they remain unsurmounted. It didn't even come close. It is an entertaining film, but, as a whole, it feels half-baked. Near the end of the Spanish Civil War, a little girl, Ofelia, is taken with her pregnant mother to an old mill, where her new husband, a sadistic army captain, awaits. At the mill, she meets a fairy who leads her to a faun, who asks her to perform three tasks so she might take her place as princess of a magical kingdom. It's less a fantasy film than a fairy tale. In that way, I suppose I'm obliged to forgive that its fantasy world goes completely unrealized and remains paper thin throughout. Honestly, except for a couple of sequences, there really isn't a fantasy world. Most of the film takes place in the real world, where the Captain is trying to rid the area of some pesky rebels and Ofelia's mother is struggling to survive her difficult pregnancy. What is much harder to forgive, though, is that Guillermo del Toro extends the two-dimensionality to the Spanish Civil War setting. The Captain is a completely cartoonish bad guy, and the situation is seen completely in black and white. I mean, we're talking about a real conflict here where many people died. It's kind of insulting. If this were an American made film, people would be railing against it. It's also insulting to Spirit of the Beehive, on which del Toro has said he based the film. Where Spirit is a gentle yet effective study on the nature of human cruelty, Pan celebrates human cruelty with extremely violent sequences which are meant to be enjoyed as they are in action films (the director did, of course, previously make Blade II and Hellboy). Wow, it sounds like I hated this film! I didn't, really. I have some ideological problems with it, obviously, and I wish it were better than it is. But it is an enjoyable little horror/fantasy film. You could do better, but you could do worse, too."
tt0457430,"I went into this movie with no expectations, except that I'd see a Spanish-language, adult-oriented fantasy film with English subtitles. I think unmet expectations can hurt people in two ways: either the film disappoints them and they are overly critical as a result, or they are disappointed but too biased to admit it. I think the latter has led to an exceedingly generous rating for this particular film. Is it good? Yes. Is it the 65th best (according to current IMDb ratings) movie of all time? Not even close.It is an interesting, original story. Virtually every actor appearing in the film is superb. The imagery is magnificent. Like I said, it is a good picture. However, I am puzzled as to why it is praised so highly. I would have a greater appreciation for the film if its adult-oriented nature was due to its substance, such as an intellectual, sophisticated and enigmatic storyline. It is adult-oriented, however, merely because of a few choice phrases and displays of graphic violence. This is not a film that is breaking new ground. It is too simplistic throughout, becomes fairly predictable, and lacks fluidity. The unimaginative way in which the fantasy elements come and go was a real put off. The 65th best movie of all time should have the fantastic elements blended seamlessly with the human elements. It should continue being original throughout. It should challenge the viewer in new and engaging ways. It should not merely curse, show some blood, and have pretty imagery.Please, see this movie and enjoy it. I truly did. I also, however, allowed myself to make a realistic assessment afterward. I expect that the rating will come down as the novelty of an adult-oriented fantasy picture wears off. Maybe I missed something, but I doubt a specious film like this can conceal such intricacies."
tt0457430,"Carmen has married Captain Vidal and, pregnant with his son, travels with her daughter Ofelia to join him in his woodland barracks where he is trying to quash the small bands of rebellion against the Fascist regime. Carmen is not well and Vidal immediately puts her into the care of Dr Ferreiro who confines her to her bed after a short time. Vidal is a cruel man, perhaps hardened by the battle he fights and the beliefs he holds and Ofelia finds him to have no time for her and her no interest in him. While she tries to cope with the reality of her new life she also finds herself taken by a fairy into a dark underworld where a faun offers her a new life as a princess if she completes a series of tasks for him.With all the papers and amateur reviewers here putting this film high up the list of best films of 2006 I rued that I missed my chance to see the film when it originally came out but got the opportunity recently on holiday in Cornwall at what my girlfriend called the ""smallest cinema on earth"" (it wasn't but it must have been close). Perhaps the weight of expectation on the film played a part but I confess to have enjoyed it but not found the masterpiece that the majority have claimed. The film works pretty well and has a very strong central narrative which, contrary to the marketing, is actually the real world and not the fantasy. This is an engaging real-world horror that focuses on the struggle between guerrilla fighters and the fascists led by Vidal. On the other side of the coin we have the fantasy involving Ofelia where, like the real world, she finds a world of darkness where she is not entirely sure who to trust. Now my main problem with the film is the overlap between these two elements and how they fit together.I have read others say that the fantasy echoes the real world but, as much as I want to see this, it just didn't ring true for me. On a very basic level I get it but that is different from the film cleverly weaving them together and making it work. This separation detracted from both aspects of the story (although less so the real parts) and also saw the fantasy be only partially explained and harder to become really engaged with. My girlfriend said she felt the story was simplistic enough to work best for older children and that the ""horror"" part was therefore too harsh as it prevented this audience getting in the door (in the UK this was rated a 15). At first I agreed with her but on reflection it actually works the other way because this is much more of an adult tale but just doesn't quite have the intelligence and complexity in all parts of the story (again specifically the fantasy).By this point my review will have been slated by all readers who are not used to a dissenting voice but for those who have made it this far let me just say that it is a very good film overall and that I did enjoy it. Outside of the plot there is much to enjoy as well. The writing is very good and the dialogue (albeit subtitled) interesting and never clunky or obvious even if some of the scenes would have made it easy for it to be so. The fantasy world is wonderfully created and engagingly dark with the creatures a mix of wonder and menace. The faun himself is good and well used although it was a shame to see such a terrifying vision such as the pale man so briefly used and with little expansion beyond a lurching menace in one scene. Del Toro directs well across all aspects of the film and keeps this sense of dark menace across everything. I also liked the references scattered across the narrative, such as Alice in Wonderland to name one in particular. He directs his cast well too, drawing a very good performance from Baquero in the central role. López could have hammed it up but, while he doesn't really make a person here, he avoids being a pantomime baddie. Verdú is strong as Mercedes while Gil is good but left with little to do outside of suffer and worry. Jones does well within his creatures to deliver the potential within the design.Overall then not strong enough in important ways to make it the classic everyone is hailing it as but certainly interesting and engaging enough to be one of stronger films of 2006. Visually impressive and very well delivered, I'm afraid I just found it hard to get over the disconnect between the two aspects of the story no matter how much I wanted to find it."
tt0457430,"I saw the movie yesterday in the Spanish premiere and I confirm: it's one of the best Guillermo del Toro's films (if not the best ever). Innocence and brutality, fantasy and reality, together in a wonderful fairy tale about the power of magic in dark times. The performances are great, mainly from Sergi López, Maribel Verdú and the big revelation of the film: the 12 years girl Ivana Baquero. Del Toro repeats the context of the film ""El Espinazo del Diablo"" (""The Devil's Backbone""), the Spanish Post-Civil War, with the same philosophy: the supernatural invading the daily life in a depressive environment and the innocence of children trapped between both world. But ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is most compact, most mature and best done in very aspects, and perhaps it's the most personal movie from Del Toro."
tt0457430,"1944, Spain, Ofelia accompanied her mother to meet up with her father, who happens to be a Captain in The Spanish Army, there Ofelia escapes into a nightmarish world, and must complete three horrifying challenges.It took me one or two viewings to fully get it, and to appreciate it, but I'm glad I did, Pan's Labyrinth is an incredible movie, it's one that will appeal to horror fans, and those that enjoy surreal stories and fantasies.Plenty of messaging to loon out for, you have to wait to learn exactly what's going on, it's worth waiting for.Beautifully acted and stunningly produced, it's a glorious looking film, I think it's aged incredibly well.Personally my favourite scene is the dinner table, Ofelia chomps down a few grapes, whilst a terrifying being wakes up, what a scene.Only from the mind of Guillermo del Toro is this possible.9/10."
tt0457430,"I saw this at this years FrightFest Film Festival in London and absolutely loved it.Guillermo was there to introduce it and you can tell it really is a film he loves and is passionate about.He referred to it as a sister movie to The Devils Backbone.Anyway . . . so the film starts and I must admit I was expecting a lot more of a fantasy film however it is more of a 70/30 split between historical era movie/fantasy fairytale.Don't let this put you off though, the film really is stunning and brilliantly acted. The little girl carries pretty much the whole film on her shoulders and does so with the skill of Atlas himself! The violence is graphic and the monsters are scary but it is probably one of the most gorgeous and personal films from a director for a long time!Give it a go if you can get to a screening, DON'T WAIT FOR DVD, it really does need to be seen on a big screen!"
tt0457430,"I saw this film toward the end of the Cannes Film Festival; it edged out all the others I'd seen, 30 of them, because of its wonderful story; history, politics and fantasy woven into a fabric spun by a superlative creative team headed by Guillermo del Toro. In comparison to this, his latest effort, del Toro's other films only hinted at the depth and breadth of his talent. In this film, much as I pride myself on foreseeing the outcome of most stories, I could not guess what would happen next. The film is quite long, yet suspense is sustained throughout. The music is some of the best I've heard in years, so well suited to the action that you almost don't notice its specific effect because of how well it is intertwined with the visual, emotional and intellectual experience.In my opinion, del Toro's ""...Labyrinth"" deserved to win at Cannes over the Ken Loach film, ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"". Actually, everyone I knew at the Festival who had seen both agreed with me. And the 22 minute ovation speaks clearly for the effect on the audience. It's hard to imagine that any film could beat it in a context other than Cannes where they have marked preferences, bordering on obsession, for certain directors.Let's hope that the late December opening favors an Oscar nomination which it should win hands down, unless some other work of genius appears on the horizon. That doesn't seem likely because at Cannes the somewhat disappointing array of films was attributed to the fact that not much great product is being released this year. I might add that I had already seen Volver prior to Pan's Labyrinth, and I maintain that Pan is the better film. For me, it displaced all three of my top films of the year. I do love The Departed but, luckily, that's in another category which does not threaten Pan's access to Oscar. If I had to choose the very best picture of the year, without limitation by category, it would most assuredly go to Pan's Labyrinth for it demonstrates del Toro's originality and brilliance as both writer and director."
tt0457430,"It is Guillermo del Toro's best film ( 22 minutes ovation at Cannes). Del Toro gets a brilliant film but also superb performances from all involved, particularly from Sergi Lopez as a brutal Fascist army captain Vidal and Doug Jones (Abe Sapien from del Toro's Hellboy) as the Pan and the wonderfully disturbing Pale Man. But the real find is Ivana Baquero (12 years old) as the young heroine Ofelia. She gives one of the best performances from a child actor we have seen since Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. Come to it unprepared and with your mind wide open and you will be rewarded with one of the best films of the year."""
tt0457430,I wish I had never seen any reviews about this movie before watching it! It made my expectations so much higher. I think it was just a good movie nothing great! I expected a lot more.
tt0457430,"When I heard first time about the movie made by the Mexican director Guillermo del Toro that was a mixture of many genres, including drama, fantasy, thriller, and fairy tale for adults that takes place in Spain of 1944 in two parallel words, one of unbearable bleak and horrifying reality, and the other of deliciously dark magic fantasy, I wanted very much to see it. I knew that the movie has been praised by many critics and has made hundreds top lists of last year, that it was nominated for countless awards including six Academy awards and it won three Oscars, and that it had received 20 minutes standing ovation at Cannes. The main reason for me was the fact that I love del Toro's earlier film, ""The Devil's Backbone"" (2001), the ultimate ghost story that goes beyond the genre and very successfully mixes horror, suspense, and coming of age during the war time story.I hoped and expected ""Pan's Labyrinth"" to be as compelling, insightful, interesting, and engaging as ""The Devil's Backbone"" was. I finally saw ""Pan's Labyrinth"" couple of days ago and I was disappointed. The movie has an interesting concept, even if not original one. It brings to mind many famous works of literature and the earlier movies about the little girls escaping their dreadful realities of war or death of the loved ones or all sorts of abuse in the world of their imagination such as ""Forbidden Games"", ""Spirits of the Beehive"" (which ""Pan's Labyrinth"" tried to be but never was), the later also takes place in Spain during the Civil war, as well as ""Wizard of Oz"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Legends and Myths of Ancient Greece"". One movie that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" has been often compared to is Terry Gilliam's ""Tideland"", his fairy tale for adults, his ""Alice in Wonderland meets Psycho"" which also tells the story of an 11-years-old girl and her world of imagination. ""Tideland"" was released last year and was either ignored or hated by majority of critics and left many viewers puzzled and confused. I am not completely in love with ""Tideland"" but I found it much more interesting that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" in all aspects. The main difference between the two - Gillian does not present reality in his film in the simplistic way and does not divide his characters to devilish monsters or shining knights the way Del Toro does in ""Pan Labyrinth"". I am not sure what the target audience for Del Toro's film is? Its story (the writer/director was nominated for the best screenplay and I found his writing the weakest and most ridiculous part of the movie) is so naive and primitive that you would think the movie was made for children but its shocking violence and horrifying tortures are not easy to watch even for adults. Another problem is with the characters. I know I should sympathize with Ofelia, and who would not feel empathy for an 11-year-old girl who had to live through the death of her mother and to confront her monstrous step-father but if frankly, her character is not very interesting. As for visual effects and cinematography, the film looks good but not especially spectacular or breathtakingly beautiful. Of five Oscar nominated films for best cinematography from last year, at least three seemed to be more interesting. Gilliam's ""Tideland"" that was completely ignored by the Academy, is always technically superb, visually arresting and much more impressive than ""Pan's Labyrinth"". I should admit that at least one scene in ""Labyrinth"" was absolutely brilliant - dark and scary it came directly from Francisco Goya's terrifying painting, ""Saturn Devouring His Children"" and it was extremely imaginative. I would not go as far as calling ""Pan's Labyrinth"" a bad movie and give it one star. It is not bad; it is just not as great as I thought it would be. As for all the awards, ""The Devil's Backbone"" is much more deserving than ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and that's the film I would give a standing ovation to."
tt0457430,"one of films who becomes an important experience. because it is, in same measure, a special war film and a fairy tale illustration. wise translation of idea of fiction as refuge against cruelty of every day life and homage to innocence. a great director. an extraordinary young actress. a story who mix fears, joy and need of measure in ambiguous world. a film like a poem. bitter, cold, touching, profound, necessary. because it is a precise exploration of life's purpose. because it is delicate and bitter and soft. a film about a war and a not ordinary, at the first sigh, manner to survive. one of films who becomes a personal memory. because it is a trip in your secret universe. and rediscover of unique colors from a special age."
tt0457430,"I stuck around for this movie to serve something not yet seen or experienced in dozens of related films which I was so sure this movie would provide. Sadly, that moment never came.Although I have no complaints with the acting and setdesigns which were on par with any quality movie, there are basically three things that deprive this movie of being anything great.1. Though truly beautifully shot, Pan's two sided scenario with the Good vs Evil Children's-picture on the one side and a drama/war-movie on the other, provides no deeper layers. A 'what you see is what you get' type of film in which the fantasy part seemed more or less something that would look nice on the adverts in combination with a superabundance of very graphic violence in a foreign movie which offers a subterfuge to sell something slight and cursory as profound and insightful. 2. Since there is no thread running through both the scenario's it is like watching two different movies which bear very little to each other nor compliment the other. Because I liked the fantasy part zealously better than the war/drama bit, I was very disappointed that it had no follow-through and that it in the end just seemed like a shameless cloned-off short-impression of movies like Alice in Wonderland, The Wizzard of Ozz and The never Ending Story, to name but a few, but never with a meaningful reference of any kind. It is almost like the writers hit behind the fact that they never even saw these movies. 3.There is just nothing subtle in the story that draws you in, I found it all annoyingly superficial and cliché. It never invites you to share the little girl's fantastic world or truly reject El Capitan's actions because it is all far too black and white. Plus the film leaves no room for any other interpretation aside from the one which is already painted elaborately on its cinematic walls. Something I find quite odd since most true children's pictures have a lot underlying messages and symbolism. The more I think about it, the more this story just seems lazily written or without any terribly interesting thought behind it. -In the end of it all, there is simply no hope-..nothing more than a flipflop of any and all sappy-happy-endings Hollywood has been laying on us for years on end. Furthermore, with style over substance as its forté the movie tends to plod tremendously at times. And since none of the characters are really focused on, they all just seem to be stereotypes and are hence neither likable nor unlikable despite their (too) obvious good or bad demeanors. Vidal is simply bad, mom is simply weak and Ofelia was nothing more than the little girl playing with imaginary friends in the corner of the room.This film is alas just another example of a movie where they just don't seem to be able to get it both ways (powerful story AND powerful cinematography) which is the Achilles' heel of many a film lately but which oddly doesn't seem to bother the average moviegoer nor professional movie-critic who somehow seem to think that foreign+different=Masterpiece."
tt0457430,"The negative reviews of this film on IMDb seem to fall into two categories: a) it was too violent b) the fantasy element was too mutedWithout getting too political, worse things are going on in the world at this very moment than were depicted in this film. While many people prefer entertainment that insulates them from the harsh realities of this world, one shouldn't get so indignant when a film portrays the world for what it is. Capitán Vidal was a fictitious character, but there are plenty of people exactly like him. Humans are capable of terrible atrocities and looking the other way does nothing to improve our nature. If violence offends people so much they should do something about real violence rather than writing nasty reviews about depictions of it.The violence set a tone of desperation for Ofelia. Fairy tales themselves are extremely violent, and Disney cartoons are nothing like the stories they were based on. This film was rated R. What were you expecting?It is easier to understand people who thought the fantasy element was eclipsed, and were maybe hoping for another Narnia or one of the other countless fantasy flicks that has come out in the wake of LOTR. This film touched on many of the most fundamental themes of mythology, such as parallel worlds, dangerous tasks, hidden identities, sacrifice, and death. It did something more than the standard fantasy movie, which is part of why it was such a great film."
tt0469494,"It has been a while since I watched a film where the acting and casting is so damn convincing - I have to start this review by saying that.The plot is definitely off the beaten track anf the writing very very much a breath of fresh air.Unfortunately this is a film that can come down to tastes quite a bit when the reviews come round, and although I can't necessarily critique it specifically, there is something about it that I just couldn't get gripped by, and the ending didn't truly satisfy me (though the end scene itself is probably the high point of the movie. Confusing review, I know)This is not a negative review by any means, but 8-10 are reserved for films that truly get you talking, or have a huge emotional impact in my opinionAs a recommendation, this film is a definite yes. I believe that I am on the side of people who this genre doesn't appeal to much at all, but as a piece of film and a showcase of acting, it is utterly utterly great."
tt0469494,"This is a compelling family drama charting one man's rise and fall as he ruthless exploits oil in the American west. It has everything you could want from a great Hollywood movie: subtlety, excellent acting, a thoughtful and intelligent script and quite wonderful cinematography.It's a film in which the oil is a supporting character in itself, and the series of unfortunate deaths and accidents that beleaguer our leading man reminded me of Emile Zola's excellent novel, Germinal. Daniel Day-Lewis gives another assured performance here, living and breathing rather than merely acting his role, and watching his growing feud with the slimy preacher is the stuff of great cinema. All in all a wonderful, epic film, old fashioned in the best possible sense."
tt0469494,"There's a prospector by the name of Daniel Plainview, a weathered type of soul, after all the things he's been through, now he's come across some oil, underneath Californian soil, and he's planning to extract, withdraw, accrue. He has a son that he acquired after a blow, now where he goes, young H. B. will also go, as he supports his father's hand, acquiring most of the scrub land, with the knowledge of the flow that sits below. But a preacher seeks to meddle, interfere, and Daniel Plainview's disinclined to be so dear, H. B's deafened by a boom, a long lost brother finds a tomb, there's no salvation, when your life's so insincere.Two of the finest cinematic characters you'll encounter."
tt0469494,"People did not like this movie for a simple reason: too negative. I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. What it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano's character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis's character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.Now is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I'am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us. Now to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.Why was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.Paul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year. He was able to show the oil fields and its processes, the rise of an oil man, the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that H.W. represented. This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.You should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I'm not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings. Why is this rated-R?It has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. Now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people, it was probably even shocking for realists. Maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don't like this movie because the truth hurts. Not the truth about corruption or about people but the truth about ourselves."
tt0469494,"It's about expansion, it's about capitalism, and whatever that caused the demise of the Wild West myth. ""There Will be Blood"" looks, smell, feels like a Western but this is an Anti-Western more than anything  There's so much to say about this movie but it left me speechless at the end, Daniel Day-Lewis was hypnotic, giving a performance that reminded me of Orson Welles in ""Citizen Kane"", and Humphrey Bogart in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" ... He's definitely one of the greatest actors of his generation, especially in this performance that probably best defines the alienating effect of materialism. The 40's had Charles Foster Kane, the 80's had Gordon Gekko and the 2000's have Daniel Planview.Indeed, ""There Will be Blood"" is not your typical 'soul corrupted by money and/or power' drama, as I said, it's all about materialism, ending with a pocket filled by gold and a heart made of the same stone you've been working on all your life, it's trusting anything that has a specific color, a specific smell, working on a land to find a greasy black liquid gushing from its womb, and never, never trusting or giving any credit to ""nothingness"" or ""abstraction"".Daniel Plainview considers these abstractions with the most profound disdain. Nothing is free, nothing comes from nothing, nothing is unsubstantial. If one claims to be your brother, he has to prove it, if one should make a deal with you, he should talk business and not about education ... not because it's personal, not because it has nothing to do with business, BUT because it is NOTHING and nothingness irritates Plainview as if the only thing he could believe on had to be material. The rest is nothing, feelings are nothing, believing is nothing, these so strong and noble words for us, well, Plainview doesn't give a damn about them...And more than anything, above all these abstractions, there is religion, God is Daniel Plainview's archenemy  this is the ultimate masquerade for him, the cancer that gangrenes the progress, an evil that transforms people into sheep, almost like animals, the biggest hypocrisy of all  Plainview, the capitalist, almost shares the same opinion than Marx who thought religion was people's opium. And because Plainview despises this hypocrisy, he tries to exorcise his hatred by using religion to achieve his plans, exploiting it, like he exploited his adopted son. No feelings, no sentiments, everything should serve a palpable purpose. The end justifies the means.And ultimately, he gets rich at the end, he's a respected and feared tycoon, as the purest and most implacable illustration of the American dream. But is he happy? no! because power, prosperity, those are still empty words ... he believes in material, in things, in stuff he drinks like the iconic 'milk-shake' metaphor that still resonates in my mind as one of the most memorable hymns to greed and pragmatism. Plainview is greedy, but not evil, evil is still too abstract a word; because it implies the use of one own conscience while Plainview's conscience was dedicated to one goal: getting bigger, possession, expansion, territoriality.And are we to blame him? Let's not forget the bleak cinematography at the beginning of the film where we could feel, the stink of the oil, the hardness of the rocks and the land as an incontrollable enemy ... let's not forget that Plainview spent half of his life stuck alone into dark holes made of land, stone, metal, oil, and raw matter, so close he could almost feel them, so close it became a part of him ...""There Will Be Blood"" is the quintessential film about materialism and its alienating power, when all that matters is matter!"
tt0469494,"This film is masterpiece on all levels. The acting from everyone, but especially Daniel Day Lewis, is amazing. The writing, is superb and fits the time period. The on location shooting, phenomenal. The script and direction from Paul Thomas Anderson has never been better. Yes, this is a slow burn, but on multiple rewatches, it doesn't feel long. In fact the slow burn feels more nuanced every time I watch this picture. Oh and we can't forget about Robert Elswit's gorgeous cinematography of California in the late 1800's. It's one of the best movies shot on film of all time, and he deservedly won the Academy Award for this. I love ""There Will Be Blood"" and it's reflection of capitalism and religion that can be seen even to this day. Thank you PTA and the rest of the cast and crew for creating a truly cinematic experience that will last forever in my head, and one that I will continue to revisit for a long time."
tt0469494,"The year I was born was the same year Predator and Robocop came out. When I was finally old enough to appreciate films, Little Nicky was in theaters. I know, believe me, I know; rocky start. And often I would watch older films, or specials on older films, and be dazzled. You know the ones. Remember when they made Spartacus? Remember sitting in the movies and watching Gregory Peck play Atticus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird? Remember the first time you heard ""I could've been a contender"" through theater speakers? Well I sure as hell don't. But I'll tell you what, now I feel somewhat caught up. Let's begin with the obvious. Daniel Day Lewis. No one's arguing about this. The man is a veritable God among ants on the screen. He takes his role by the reigns and I don't doubt him for a second. In fact, at times, I was downright afraid of the man. Lewis gives what is easily, EASILY the best performance of the past five years. But let's get serious about it. Lewis' Daniel Plainview is the most convincing, awe-inspiring, and downright mortifying character to take the big screen that I can remember. Here, perfectly in his element and at his best, Lewis could go toe to toe with Brando and Kinski, playing a part that oozes enough skill and pathos to earn him a place among Hollywood's, and perhaps the world's, greatest performances of all time. He gives those of us who missed out on the craft, depth of character, and technique of classic cinema a chance to admire a tour de force portrayal of a memorable, identifiable, and completely despicable character, and it's so damned refreshing that I can't stop singing the man's praises. Paul Dano has been taking a lot of fire for this whole thing. People continue to spout their disapproval of the film's casting, saying that Dano has no business rivaling the seasoned Lewis on the screen. Listen, lay down your swords a minute and consider the obvious. The guy was cast opposite the performance of the decade, he's not going to outshine Lewis and you'd be crazy to expect him to. In fact, I think that he and Lewis' back-and-forths are the films highlights, as we see the juxtaposition not only in the characters themselves, but also in their acting techniques. And the cinematography? Welcome to the old days of film. The glory days of Hollywood. Anderson gives us one of the most beautifully shot and directed films in recent memory, truly at the top of his craft on this one. Every moment feels more epic than the last, until the film becomes such a towering cinematic spectacle that the end leaves the viewer exhausted. It's truly an experience not to be missed. Yeah, we missed out on A Street Car Named Desire. And Casablanca isn't gonna be in theaters again any time soon. But in the meantime, There Will Be Blood is just about as good, and will likely haunt our generation as much as the Hollywood studio epics of the past..."
tt0469494,"There Will Be Blood. Chilling, Sublime, perfect.First I must say the Soundtrack is amazingly disturbing and sets the tone of the film from the first scene. Many forget the amount of mood that sound sets. The film held me enraptured from first to last second.The story is perfectly displayed. Ever thing is laid out before the viewer in an intentional pace. The film is for viewers with imagination and foresight who can see through the shams of modern movie plot and into the realm of literature.The acting is simply stunning. Daniel Day Lewis can portray lines with a single expression and does in this film.I'm sure many will not enjoy this movie and all I have to say to them is go watch Transformers 2 again."
tt0469494,"PT Anderson's name already means something, or I should say something else. His self assuredness alone gives me shivers. A modern artist with such clear and severe vision of the world. Boogie Nights, Magnolia, even Punch Drunk Love have an Wellesian disregard for what's in or out. His films are landmarks that may infuriate some, confuse others and mesmerize the rest of us. Here, with the rigorous tale of an impervious oil man, PT Anderson outdoes himself. He has Daniel Day Lewis as his accomplice in a performance that would be as difficult to match as it is difficult to describe. There is a monstrous beauty here that not even a broken nose can disguise. The saga is filled with long silent moments of tension that take place in a cinematic canvas and an actor's head. PT Anderson must have known that this was going to be, not only not a mainstream opus but a hard pill to swallow. I for one stand up to applaud his daringness."
tt0469494,"There Will be Blood! What a fine film! In fact I would go as far to say it is one of the best of the last decade. Visually, it is stunning, I loved the skillful cinematography and shots and the scenery was amazing. Jonny Greenwood's music is atmospheric and haunting as well, the script is lyrical, hysterical and sometimes even baffling, the story is excellent and thematically rich and the pace is fine, quite slow but deliberately so.There Will be Blood is brilliantly directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and the characters are intriguing. In fact to me the character of Daniel Plainview makes the movie. Magnificently portrayed by Daniel Day Lewis, he is quite complex- while monstrous and cold-hearted, because of his love for his adopted son I wouldn't necessarily call him completely evil either. Paul Dano also does a fine job as Eli Sunday.Overall, a truly fine film and one of the best of the last decade in my view. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0469494,"This is a most difficult movie to comment on, and I find it hard to put into words as to the reason. I think I enjoyed the movie, but how, why? Did I enjoy Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal as the leading antagonist? Most defiantly. DDL has provided us with many memorable performances and his role as Daniel Plainview is no less in intensity as was Butcher Bob, nor any less authentic as Nathaniel Poe. Did I enjoy other aspects of the film? Sure! The period piece was of considerable interest; how oil can transform your life, for better, worse or otherwise. The cinematography was beautiful and telling. I fully appreciate the hard, dirty, bone weary work that this occupation would entail. The rag tag day-to-day existence for those working the oil fields, and the land from whence it came. The score too was beautifully blended, adding to the epic scope of the experience. Paul Dano was very convincing too as the prophet/preacher of the small community where Plainview acquires vast tracks of land. His character was equally complex, and I felt he complimented DDL quite adequately. Even the story had many merits, as we came to understand the type of people who produced oil, and how the product of its labor and influence can impact those who were associated with its extraction. So one would think that the buzz and hype around it in February 2008 are worthwhile, yet I cannot seem to agree. There is something missing, something that falls short of the expectations. Too many people are of opposite opinion regarding this movie; it is either a masterpiece or drivel. I find it is neither, although I am much more likely to lean towards the former. For that reason alone I should be what, somewhere five or seven on a scale of 1-10? Perhaps it does, I just wish I could feel it. So should I give it a 7 and stop wasting time lamenting over it? Yes, a 7, for reasons I can explain but not feel confident about. It pains me to do so, therefore I can only conclude that my expectations for this movie were not met."
tt0469494,"Totally confused, but never fear, I got it.Performances, cinematography, actors, Daniel Day Lewis, blah blah blah - all great.....BUT.............I simply didn't like it.I won't say any more than that."
tt0469494,"This film raises the game for everyone out there. I have loved all of Paul Thomas Anderson's work, including his greatly underrated Punch-Drunk Love, but this is a huge leap from any of the previous movies into a realm, as others have said, inhabited by classics such as Treasure of the Sierra Madre - and then some. Every element of this film is astonishing, from the opening twenty minutes, which feature virtually no dialog, to Jonny Greenwood's score, which I have heard criticized as too imposing but which seems just about perfect to me (and brings to mind the non-Blue Danube elements of 2001 at its most experimental). Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is in a league of its own: his voice, his mannerisms, his physical movement, his stunted emotions, are flesh and blood, and hauntingly so, in a way that even Tommy Lee Jones in In The Valley of Elah (which I thought was a pretty staggering performance) can't quite attain. I will watch this film again and again simply to see something so raw and so moving and so gut-wrenching. This is why I love movies; this is what made me want to make movies when I was fourteen years old."
tt0469494,"Who is Paul Thomas Anderson? There is something about him that does't belong to this earth. That could be a compliment or not, it's all up to us. That's what make his cinema so damn unique. At the end of the day it's all up to us. But the abrasive way in which he visits universes and throws his views to us is so powerful, so arrogant, so enthralling, so infuriating that the experience leaves you baffled and suspicious. but also enchanted, transformed. Here, Daniel's saga could very well be the saga of a Hollywood maverick. So little time for sentimentality. Daniel Day Lewis seems to understand it all and he adds his unmistakable humanity to another monster, after his butcher in Gangs Of New York. His performance goes beyond anything we've seen recently anywhere. From Upton Sinclair to Paul Thomas Anderson via Daniel Day Lewis an unmissable work of art."
tt0469494,"PT Anderson delivers perhaps his best work with ""There Will Be Blood"". Unlike ""Magnolia"", the film's daunting runtime is not very daunting whilst watching it. All acting in the film was solid, even the work of the child actors. Daniel Day-Lewis in particular delivered a truly phenomenal performance, capturing the power of greed, fear, insanity, and comedy simultaneously, at many points throughout the film. At no point does the time period distract from the power of the film. Sometimes period pieces cannot be appreciated because they delve too deep into historical details -- turning the experience into more of a documentary than a narrative set in the past. This is not the case for ""There Will Be Blood"", as human interactions are the focus of the film. Johnny Greenwood's chilling score is very strong, benefiting from the elegant minimalism that he show's in the band Radiohead. The cinematography is also spectacular. Robert Elswit beautifully captures the essence of the environment and the tension amongst the characters. All in all, this is truly a perfectly crafted film."
tt0469494,"I had heard about what a great movie ""There Will Be Blood"" is. A friend of my family said that she didn't really like the movie, but described a certain sound in it.Well, now that I've seen the movie, there are a few things that I can say about it. First, Daniel Day-Lewis does a great job playing the completely maniacal, amoral, self-aggrandizing oil magnate Daniel Plainview. Second, Plainview's speech about how he'll bring all the modern amenities to the small town; that brings to mind the fact that the whole American west now does have all those things...they put all these things in the middle of the desert, prompting everyone to use a lot of water, resulting in water shortages. Third, the subject of petroleum calls to mind present-day international politics. Finally, I would say that Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano each individually are better than the movie as a whole (not to diminish the film).Probably the most intense scene is the final segment: there's what Plainview does to his son and then to Paul Sunday (or is it Eli?). All in all, it not only adds up to a very good movie, but Paul Thomas Anderson (""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"") is showing himself to be a very good director."
tt0469494,"What is evil? What is hate? How low can an individual go with one's actions and still be considered human....? These, quite possibly, are the biggest questions raised in There Will Be Blood.Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day-Lewis, the tycoons at the helm of this dig for moral oil, tell a story that takes the archetypal anti-heroes of 'Citizen Kane' and Travis Bickle of 'Taxi Driver' to a whole new, 21st-century level. The film, using Lewis's character Daniel Plainview, walks through incredibly dangerous cinematic territory that questions religion, plays with the nature of greed and hate and evil, and with it all, draws terrifying parallels to the world we live in today. The film and its main character claw so deep through the limits of humanity and the landscape of hell, that you'll be thanking the Good Lord for the silver screen that divides you from this horrible world Paul Thomas Anderson has portrayed. But despite how safe you may seem in your cushy seat, you will undoubtedly walk out of the theater with all kinds of new demons and ghosts buzzing in your head and ripping away at your subconscious. In this way, Anderson has abandoned his primary previous influence of Robert Altman to take more of a Stanley Kubrick direction, creating moral allegories that creep into your psyche and don't ever leave. You should be scared. Very Scared."
tt0469494,"If Daniel Day-Lewis doesn't win an Oscar for this performance, there is something horribly wrong. His performance and this film were amazing. I don't give this kind of accolade out generously. I was at the screening at the Chelsea West. We waited outside in the cold and rain for a good two hours to get in there and get some good seats and I can honestly say, I would have waited double that amount of time. Enough of my rambling though. In regards to the film itself; it was very well done. The cinematography was amazing as well as the set design. As usual, PTA gives us a flawless script with terrifying, humorous, and compelling dialogue. All of the acting was spot on. Paul Dano played the role of a two-faced, maniacal, and power hungry preacher. The young man who plays H.W. Plainview was also very solid. As PTA stated during the Q&A last night, he seemed to know everything about the story and his character and seemed to be a natural. Daniel Day-Lewis. Need I say more? He was breathtaking in TWBB. Amazing is all i can say. You will need to see the film to see for yourself. Some may become bored with the film at times, which is what i gathered from the people sitting around me. I had no problem with the ""slow"" scenes, but the general public may have a problem grasping this film. If anything, this will be the reason if it gets snubbed at the Oscars."
tt0469494,"This movie had fantastic acting, beautiful visuals, and a tremendous authentic feel to it. On the other hand, the story was slow in parts, the soundtrack was ghastly, and the movie was a tad pretentious. Let's face it, Daniel Day Lewis is one of this generation's finest actors and deserves any accolades for his performance. What I don't get is why this movie is being touted as the one of the 200 best movies of all-time. It was OK. Some great things, some not so great things. Could it have been shorter? Probably. But there are plenty of fantastic, epic 3 hour movies for all kinds of taste (Braveheart, Lord of the Rings, Gone With The Wind, etc). I just don't think this was one of them.If you are a fan of DDL, then you will likely enjoy this movie. It had some funny moments and several great scenes. But it is boring. Heck, there isn't a single word spoken for the first 30 minutes. OK perhaps I am exaggerating, but it seemed like 30 minutes. In fact, during the first scene, I thought, ""That has to be the most boring job in the world."" 60 minutes later I realized I was mistaken - a film critic having to sit through this movie would be the most boring job in the world. However, it did improve, if only slightly.In the end, this was really nothing more than a turn of the century period piece about the oil rush. There was a lot of ""I'm going to buy that land!"" and ""I like to quail hunt"" and ""we believe in God, you heathen!"" I think I expected too much and was let down. I wanted Gangs of New York and The Last of the Mohicans and instead I got The Aviator....a fine movie, about a crazy rich guy. Don't give me my money back, just warn me next time."
tt1130884,"I originally saw this film when it came out but couldn't remember it well enough to give it a rating or write a review, so a rewatch was in order. I viewed the film through the lens of already knowing the plot twist, which made it a whole different experience. The ending will be remembered throughout film history as one that showed just how viciously a well written script can flip an audience over. This really is a film you should see twice."
tt1130884,"Martin Scorsese has done it again. He pays attention to every detail in this film, making ""Shutter Island"" one of the best suspense thrillers of all time.Visually intriguing, simplistic and absolutely phenomenal. The story is kept simplistic enough so it doesn't get absurd, but allows for an ending which you probably won't see coming. The film doesn't go for cheap thrills, so although you will be on the edge of your seat you won't get needlessly scared.The film uses everything at its disposal from breathtaking scenery, to detailed laid-out shots, and to actors at their finest to completely engross you in the film. I loved every minute of it and highly recommend it to everyone. Even if you're not a usual fan of the genre, this film has so much more to it."
tt1130884,"Shutter Island. A film that will divide the film community. A film that will leave many upset, and hating it. A film that has already completely split the critics. A movie that messes with you. And no one likes to be messed with. And that is exactly where it exceeds. Think I'm contradicting myself? Shutter Island is one of the most well crafted psychological thrillers to come by since Silence Of The Lambs. And it is no coincidence both were brilliantly written novels. Shutter Island is adapted by a book written by Dennis Lehane (wrote gone baby, gone and mystic river). It is a book filled with twists and turns, that will leave the reader dizzy. And, that is what it's film counterpart does to the fullest. Martin Scorsese helms the director chair, in a movie where he is more free than any before. This is Scorsese at his most unrestrained. Marty takes what he has learned from the great films of the past and puts it into his. The master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock's influence is everywhere you look in this film. And it is no wonder, considering Scorsese even showed one of his greatest works to the crew: Vertigo. And many of those ideas are present in Shutter Island; the cliff scenes scream Hitchcock. This is a film that creeps and crawls, and is filled with dark corners. And it is all heightened by the coming storm that looms over the island. This is classic film noir. The story follows Teddy, a federal Marshall, and his partner Chuck (Played by DiCaprio and Ruffulo). They go to this mysterious island enveloped in fog to investigate an escape. From these opening scenes, Marty has set up a dark and creepy premise. Almost the whole movie incorporates this story as Teddy desperately tries to find the truths he seeks. Teddy is shown as a scared man; a man of war and violence as portrayed in various flashbacks. These will go on to be increasingly important as the story progresses. We follow Teddy on his quest, through every dark corridor and perilous confrontations. Slowly, we are given pieces to the puzzle, but the audience does not even realize it. For we, like Teddy, are blind. For the moment at least. It is because of this that the thrilling conclusion will leave many blindsided. But, you see, that is where this thriller becomes something more. We as the audience are put in Teddy's shoes, and we feel all the things he feels. It is a complete assault on the senses, and it works beautifully. This is a film you must watch carefully. That is another thing that sets this apart, it is a horror film that makes you actually think. In this day and age, I'm not surprised some found it terrible esp. after their brains have been turned to mush by these new gore filled horror films. Scorsese's ultimate goal here is to wake you up. And trust me, you probably wont like it. This is also a film I would recommend seeing a second time. In fact, it is even better the second time. All those pieces of that puzzle you didn't catch the first time, you will the second. You see, we as the audience are first put in the shoes of Teddy. The second? Well, without giving too much away, lets just say you are put in someones else's shoes entirely during the second viewing. Shutter Island. A film that will make you question your own sanity. A film that will leave you breathless. A film that has re-ignited the thriller genre. A film that will leave you, and the main character, searching for answers. 10 out of 10 -CLS"
tt1130884,"It is one of the best movies made by director Martin Scorsese. It is perhaps the best movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Honestly speaking, it is one of the greatest films of the decade. DiCaprio featured in two movies in 2010, the other one being ""Inception"". Both were excellent. To this day, they are some of the best cinematic experience I have ever had. That being said, I found ""Shutter Island"" to be much more superior, as ""Inception"" feels a little bit of a mumbo jumbo many times.Good.
""Shutter Island"" is simply a masterpiece. The beginning of the movie suggests a very basic plot of a detective story, possibly a thriller. As the movie progresses, the plot becomes bigger and bigger with more and more complexity added to it. The way this happens is incredible. The pacing is really good. That is what makes the movie so interesting. And, even though the movie gets more complex, it is not difficult to keep up with the major plot points. And, the final twist is one of the best plot twists I have ever seen. I did not expect it at all. And, like the main character portrayed by DiCaprio, we are not ready to believe what is being told until a lot of reveals finally convince us. There are a lot of many things that might seem to be pointless before the final twist which are totally relevant with the story that is actually being told. The character of Edward Daniels is superbly written. We get to know where the character is coming from and we can get behind the character - yet another excellent thing about this movie. There are some dream sequences that seems like a filler, but is a major indication to the reveal. There are quite many ""illusions"" which feel very real, but carry no real meaning in the end. There are many additional things which may seem like a diversion from the story being told, but are actually enhancing it. Some dialogues between the main character and an imprisoned character get a very different interpretation after it's all set and done. So much of a complex story, yet no giant inconsistencies at all. It's just superbly written and directed and acted. It's totally different from ""Memento"" (2000) but still, has a lot of similarities. We get into the main character's head and we just get his interpretations, different types though. Towards the end, we don't want to step fully outside his head, but when we finally do, it's mind blowing. The ending moments were conceived by many to be confusing. But, if you keep up with the entire story, it's meaning is quite obvious. The movie is dark and psychologically engrossing. Yet it does have a short lived and very brief happy moment with the tiny plotline involving Dr. Cawley's motives. That's all I can say without getting into complete spoilers. Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsly have given some of the great performances till date. I don't have anything that bugged me. So no mixed or bad aspects of the film.Conclusion.
On the whole, for me, it's the movie of the decade. The decade is almost over, and still I have not got any movie in the league of ""Shutter Island"". It's a very engaging and thrilling movie. It's one of those films I consider to be an all time great.Rating.
Score : absolute 10/10
Grade : A+"
tt1130884,"There is one line of dialogue, right at the end of Shutter Island before the credits roll, that elevates the emotion of the film and makes it much more powerful. For those of you, like me, who read and enjoyed the novel before seeing the film and felt that the trailers and advertisements for this film were leading you to believe there wouldn't be any narrative surprises in store, think again! Scorsese's film features that one brief piece of dialogue at the films conclusion that results in an entirely different perception of the final act. The rest of the film, however, is very faithful to Dennis Lehane's already great story.Shutter Island represents exactly what one should hope for when seeing a novel being interpreted to film. While it certainly does the source material justice, it also adds small changes that make for a distinctive experience. Even if you've read the novel multiple times, you'll feel like you're reading the book for the first time again while watching. Scorsese perfectly recreates the menacing atmosphere of the island on film. Every location is foreboding and drenched with hints of unseen danger in dark corners. The lighthouse, the caves, the civil war fort housing ""the most dangerous patients,"" and the island itself--every locale seems large yet claustrophobic and isolated at the same time.I often experience claustrophobia myself and there are certain films that really capitalize on that personal fear and make it more relevant and eerie to me. Neil Marshall's The Descent was one such picture, and this is another. An confined island is a terrific horror location and it comes with its own type of fear. The utter desperation to escape from a persistent and confined nightmare is something Teddy (Dicaprio) is receiving in high doses, and so does the audience.As with Scorsese and DiCaprio's previous collaborations, this is a movie that must be seen. Here they explore the horror/thriller genre with gravitas, with no small part played by Laeta Kalogridis in supplying the screenplay. While most modern pictures of its kind lack character or any real sense of suspense, Shutter Island doesn't go for cheap gags. I concur with Ebert when he says one of the key elements to this film is that it releases its tension through suspense instead of mindless action sequences. That's not to knock a well-deserved frenetic scene of violence every once in awhile--it works to the advantage of some films like Evil Dead II and Planet Terror--but had Teddy and Chuck gone running and gunning through the facility's faculty, the mood this movie keeps in check so well would have been lost.However, that mood isn't sacrificed and ""spooky"" is punched up to full force. A considerable amount of that spooky is generated by a ""best of"" collection of actors that have mastered the art of creepy: Ben Kingsley, Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levine, and Max Von Sydow just to name a few. Had Tom Noonan been thrown in the cast as well, my ""Top Five People I Would Not Want to Be Left in the Dark with, Especially in a Room with No Doors or Windows"" list would have been completely exhausted. On that note, is it just me or has Sydow mysteriously not aged since The Exorcist? Was there a secret pact made between Lucifer and Father Merrin? Whether he sold his soul or not, he's quite ominous in every single scene he is present in. All of this great talent in front of the camera doesn't mean anything though if you don't have a faithful orchestrator behind it. Luckily you have Scorsese leading the lens and he points the movie in the right direction, even if this isn't among his very best works. His style works amazingly with suspense laden projects and at times he even seems to channel Hitchcock and Kubrick, though there's always something distinctively Scorsese about the presentation. I found the editing in the opening scene, with Chuck and Teddy approaching Shutter Island, to be very odd and frantic, though I think the audience will know why Scorsese displayed the scene the way he did after completing the film.With a body of work so impressive, Shutter Island is among captivating company. The good news is that Shutter Island carves out a place of its own in his resume. While no Goodfellas or Raging Bull or Taxi Driver, I have no problem placing Shutter side by side The Last Temptation of Christ and Bringing Out the Dead. The cinematography is bright and gorgeous. Scorsese doesn't rely on the over-grainy, ugly presentation that most modern horror or suspense-riddled thrillers rely on. He uses lush, bright color during daytime and dream sequences to flush out a distinct feeling of terror.Shutter Island isn't just a pretty face, its also got a great story to boot and this is why I've been anticipating the film for so long. As mentioned earlier, I've been exposed and digested the source material myself before seeing the movie. I was worried the trailers for the film were giving away too much through their spots on television and on the silver screen, but Scorsese has added enough to the film for the story to feel fresh even for those ""in the know."" You are transferred in the films paranoia and phobia once the camera pans through the mental facilities open doors. Lehane is one of the luckiest authors on the planet to have his work adapted to the big screen by talents such as Eastwood and Scorsese, but his work is brilliant and deserving of such treatment.At the risk of spoiling plot points for potential viewers who have not read the book, I'll leave a Related Recommendations section concealed in ""Spoiler"" tags. Discussing this story at any length can be quite revealing."
tt1130884,"Visually beautiful, wonderfully acted, and relentlessly gripping, Shutter Island is a brilliantly unrestrained psychological thriller that keeps its audience riveted throughout its entire duration."
tt1130884,"Shutter Island is a body of land in Boston Harbor which has a hospital for the criminally insane. It's run by a pair of doctors played by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow who have certainly essayed roles of some very deep villainy. Couple that with the fact that this film is set in post World War II where America has just been fighting with people who have mysterious accents like Von Sydow and Kingsley. It's a recipe for a Hitchcock like thriller.US Marshal Leonardo DiCaprio has been sent to Shutter Island with his new partner Mark Ruffalo to investigate the disappearance of a woman who was declared criminally insane by the courts and is now confined to the island facility. Though it is a hospital also, primarily Shutter Island is a prison and run by the Federal government and subject to their jurisdiction. Although Ruffalo is content to follow DiCaprio's lead, Leo's not happy with the lack of cooperation he's getting on the investigation, even more unhappy that inclement weather is forcing he and Ruffalo to stay on the island. Something suspicious is going on and DiCaprio's going to get to the bottom of it.Actually something very suspicious is going on there, some very intricate mind games are being played, some experimentation is being conducted by the staff. But trust me, it's beyond DiCaprio's powers of grasp.Shutter Island marks the third film that Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio have teamed as director/star. It's possible Leo is trying to tie Robert DeNiro for times working with Scorsese. This part is certainly one a younger DeNiro might have done. I don't think Shutter Island ranks up there with either The Aviator or The Departed it's still an intricately plotted story and one where the lead has to be convincing or the film goes nowhere. DiCaprio doggedly plods on with his investigation while battling some inner demons that the audience is gradually let it on. A younger DeNiro couldn't have been better.The rest of the cast ably supports Leo, but in the final analysis Shutter Island belongs to him and to Martin Scorsese for putting it all together. Alfred Hitchcock would be proud."
tt1130884,"I just saw Shutter Island this evening, just prior to its American release. I have to say this film was full of intrigue. Prior to viewing this film I had built a preconceived notion of what this thriller was going to be like because I was fooled yet again by good marketing when watching the trailer. This is probably not the movie for your average film-goer who wants an easy plot line to follow and little thought required. This movie does challenge the viewer physchologically and definitely holds your attention all the way through. For someone who was never much of a Leonardo fan, his performance is brilliant, so much range to his character. In fact all of the acting in this film is excellent. The directing is probably the best quality to this film. I always enjoy watching a film that is as unpredicatable as this film and where the director has turned the plot line on to his viewer."
tt1130884,"I saw this and I knew what to expect going in to the film as I had already read about half of the book but never got the chance to finish it. But I was surprised at how faithful the film was to the original material.The directing was also masterfully done and pretty cool I saw some cool camera tricks I hadn't seen since Martin Scorsese directed Bringing Out The Dead, Martin Scorsese did one great job and everyone was top notch especially Ben Kingsley and DiCaprio and I never though I would jump out of fright especially in a Scorsese film but I did. All in all a solid thriller with a good story and some great performances and for me it's the best film I've seen in 2010 so far."
tt1130884,"From the look of the trailer, Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" looks more like a horror film This is a dangerous place where isolation rules under fascist control. A U.S Marshall is sent to an asylum to investigate a missing patient but discovers so much more. A demon? A ghost? Something more? Is this going to be as disappointing as I think it is?I was skeptical walking into the theater, wondering if this twist could hold water. The film starts with Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck, standing on a ferry. They talk about their assignment. What's suspect here is that there is no additional development. We are bam, smack right into the story without so much as an opening montage. All that we see is the men smoking a couple cigarettes. Though this is what begins as momentous development. As our hero smokes we that this isn't the glorified top lit smoking of a beauty or that of a sophisticated and confident gangster. We see that this is a harsher character with poor posture, someone who doesn't sleep well, someone with a deep pastThey are greeted at the gate by guards whose attitudes' seem immediately suspect. Soon we meet Dr Crawley, a seemingly complex and modern man who runs the asylum. However, he soon turns uncooperative with the investigation. Inmates and staff are hiding something but what? Everyone here seems off. Evidence and clues begin to appear but not before our hero seems riddled by psychosis himself. ""You act like all this madness is contagious."" Daniels says to the guard. Is it? Soon we begin to wonder, too, but not before he uncovers the tip of the iceberg and it's not only painfully intimate with his own past but also a mass conspiracy. The Nazis had concentration camps and the Americans have Shutter Island.Though, it doesn't stop here, but to say anything else would do the story injustice Kingsley is in his finest role in years. Similarly, DiCaprio reaches new levels. Amongst others Elias Koteas, Ted Levine, Michelle Williams, all play small but wonderful roles. Robert Richardson captures a world all of its own.While Scorsese is a master of film I'd say that his specialty has been more character than story. This is a fresh balance of both. It's a mix of noir and thriller. It's only sort of a horror movie and could be compared to ""The Shining"" but it makes it look like it's a one trick pony. All this praise being said it's not for everyone. The story is complex. It takes some attention. At times it's a bit bleak and dire. Of course it all makes a little less sense when you actually think about it but then again that's film. There are a couple of moments where the story gets lost within itself. Things become a bit too complicated. At this point you might begin to lose faith in its viscosity, but don't worry because the story has you right where its put you."
tt1130884,"US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) travels to an island asylum facility for the criminally insane with his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). Their reason for being at Ashecliff Hospital is to investigate the mysterious disappearance of murderess Rachel Solando. But Teddy has another issue to deal with at Ashecliff, namely a meeting with Andrew Laeddis (Elias Koteas), the man he believes responsible for the death of his wife (Michelle Williams). Nothing is what it seems at the facility though, and the further Teddy & Chuck investigate, the murkier the truths of Ashecliff become.Directed by Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island is adapted from the best selling novel of the same name written by Dennis Lehane (""Mystic River/Gone Baby Gone""). It finds the talented director getting closer to horror than at any point in his career, it also finds him arguably over cooking his grits. Lehane's novel is a page turning lesson in thriller writing, there's no need for deep cranial thinking or fill in the blanks like musings. Scorsese has crafted a movie that, whilst both stylish and moody, is far more intricate than it needed to be.From the off we saw reams of amateur reviewers dissecting the film and searching for other worldly cinematic meanings. The truth is, is that they don't exist, it is just a great story pinging with psychological twisters. Lehane himself said he felt it was a book he kind of knocked out while in his flow (he undersells himself mind). Scorsese, clearly loving the source to be sure, has crammed too much in for the film to be an across the board winner. Technically accomplished? Without doubt. Depth to the story? You bet. But the reality is that the depth isn't enough to sustain all the genre blending atmospherics that is Marty's want. One is inclined to feel that he so aware that he is treading on well worn genre ground (spot the homages to film noir, old time horror and Hitchcockian grandeur), that he's trying to steer the viewers away from the obviousness on offer. The film is further let down by the second half, where it positively crawls along, something not helped by the fact that the first hour bristles with moody excitement and a promise of clinically executed terror. Anticipation can be a real killer at times...Yet as is normally the way with a professionally assembled Scorsese picture, there's still so much to enjoy and moments that ensure it will always be a divisive film in the New Yorker's cannon. The cast are mostly great, DiCaprio delivers a stunning performance, one that can only be appreciated once the story has reached the climax. Ruffalo (restrained), Ben Kingsley (shifty) & Max Von Sydow (troubling) all do what is needed and in keeping with the tone of the piece. While the girls - Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson & Williams - have small but crucial parts to play.Then there's the supporting characters played by some quality character actors. Koteas is joined by Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levein & John Carroll Lynch. How many of you noticed that we here have a roll call of cinematic serial killers? Edgar Reese, Freddy Krueger, Buffalo Bill and Arthur Lee Allen! (OK, Allen was not proved but ""Zodiac"" the movie lends us to believe it was him). The music used is suitably heart pounding and Robert Richardson's photography is on the money, especially within the dimly lit Ashecliff walls (the foreboding Medfield State Hospital for location filming). The costumes also have a nice 50s look to them, our first encounter of Teddy & Chuck sees them splendidly adorned in film noir hats and coats. While Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is up to the usual tight standard.It's always tricky when great directors are involved, so unsurprisingly we witnessed at the start a difference of opinion with the critics as to how good Shutter Island is? What most agreed on was that the film fluctuates in quality and should have been, given the talent behind and in front of the camera, a much better picture. There's also no getting away from the fact that if you have read the book first the impact of the ending is considerably weakened. Personally I feel Scorsese was the wrong director for this particular source, but that's me, and be that as it may, he still manages to come out of it in credit with his fans - though even if he just passed gas some of them would proclaim it as a masterpiece... 7.5/10"
tt1130884,"US Marshals Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule travel to an asylum on a remote island, aiming to discover a missing patient, there they discover some very strange goings on there.Shutter Island is probably in my top twenty films of all time, when I first saw it I didn't fully understand it, since then I've studied all sorts of theories, and tried to put the pieces together.You may need to watch it for a second time, as some of the pieces mah not fall into place, but when they do..... The twist was brilliant, I didn't see it coming first time round.Gripping, imaginative, clever, twisted, engrossing, I could go on, it's a wonderful movie, one that really does make you think, as an attentive viewer you will be hugely rewarded.I don't know why, but to me it's never felt like a Martin Scorsese film, maybe it's the tone or the actual story itself, but it's just so unlike any of this other works.Scorsese always knows how to get the best our of Di Caprio, and once again he delivers, it's a quite brilliant performance.10/10."
tt0367110,"This is definitely worth watching. The direction is restrained, SRK has acted really well after a long time, and there is a naive yet charming idealism underpinning the movie. It could have been a tad shorter, crisper editing would have helped. BO-wise it is a risky movie - unapologetic in its depiction of poverty and almost childlike in its appeal to NRIs and India's middle class to acknowledge poverty and try to do something about it. Gowarikar's heart is in the right place - the shots with the family unable to pay land rents, and the waterboy were graceful and poignant. My hunch is that regardless of BO fate, this is an important movie and will be referred to for year to come."
tt0367110,"I recently saw 'Swades' for the first time in it's entirety and was just blown away by it's mature and intelligent treatment on the subject of brain drain. Director Ashutosh G has succeeded in making me feeling completely rejuvenated. There are so many magical moments in the movie,to pin them down would be fruitless. It goes to show what conviction, effort and the power of imagination can accomplish when they all come together in such wonderful fashion. The movie has all my favorite elements- simple clean humor, realism, a blend of old and new values,some truly good old fashioned romance and idealism. I was swept away by the lyrical quality to the film. There were many scenes that stood out. The scene where Mohan and Gita meet for the first time was refreshing and witty.The scene where Mohan entertains the village-folk with the powers of his imagination when the movie projector breaks down....the train scene where Mohan witnesses the hardships faced by rural folk up close... It would be a travesty to think that anyone but SRK was born to play Mohan Bhargava. I've never been a SRK fan,given his penchant for safe roles and scripts.But this movie has changed all that for me. I have a new found respect for his talent. Maybe he will go back to playing inane lover boy roles in the future but for me, he will forever be NASA project manager turned rural crusader Mohan Bhargava. His honest,restrained and utterly convincing portrayal of a successful NRI works,and how! This movie reminded me of a lot of things I had forgotten or pushed into the back of my mind. Indian values.Ethics.The unadulterated and intoxicating joy of pure love.Respect for one's elders and nation. I rarely am moved by any recent Hindi movie. To my chagrin, I even got emotional at certain junctures of the film. I'm sure many of you felt the same way,especially those of us living outside the country. I understand that it's quite possible that's its impact is much more since I'm living abroad, but there's no taking away from the fact that this piece of cinema will be remembered and hailed as a classic work....even a few decades down the line. I salute the makers, crew and other technicians who created this movie. We need more cinema like this. It is relevant, entertaining and has a poignant message. Never, ever forget your roots. This movie made me feel proud to be an Indian and what we, as a people,stand for."
tt0367110,"This is one of the most thought provoking movies to come out of Bollywood in recent times. I loved the characters of pretty much everyone in the movie but felt that all the good work was little bit undone by the length. Yes, Lagaan was long too but then it had a cricket match running and that was enough to maintain the intensity. However, it has to be said that AR Rehman's background score especially during the scenes when Shahrukh Khan travels by train and boat is nothing short of brilliant.The movie also fell a little short in that it failed to address all the ideas about India that it raised. However, I am giving it high ratings because the script is good and fresh and the director has done his job passionately.Its good to see Gowariker doing movies close to his heart and not falling for the ""mass-hit"" formula which many other promising directors have done.Prashanth"
tt0367110,"30 minutes after I had viewed the film on Sat, I was not sure about how I felt about this film. 48 hours hence, I vividly remember most of the scenes and can lucidly state that is truly 'haunting'.Swades is not colorful; Shahrukh doesn't appear in a GAP or POLO SPORT; there are no introductory shots; there are no romantic scenes and no fields with yellow Tulip flowers; It may be a tad slow and lengthy; But Swades hits you where your heart hurts the most; patriotic and root feelings of an individual with good intentions overcoming societal obstacle. It's brilliant, heartfelt and touching. The 'We, People' film really makes us feel like it's our film. We see in the film what we see everyday, the places as they are. It's very much contemporary and it's our story.Compared to Veer-Zaara, it's light years ahead. Comparisons with Lagaan are bound to be there, but in some ways it's even better than Lagaan. Primarily, for the authenticity and real-life feel unlike Lagaan which was a finely crafted fairly-tale. Lagaan is all about emerging victorious and fighting against the odds. You enjoy it when you see it. Swades is about the conscience trauma of an Indian, urging him to comeback and do something for his country. It haunts you for long enough after the cinema has ended.There's a prejudice that the film is about bringing electricity to a small village. It's not. And the most poignant scene in the film, where we see a boy selling water for 25 paisa, hits you hard. Seeing the harsh reality and we'll find it difficult to suppress our tears. It's an answer to the generation of materialistic 'we', who never shy from proclaiming our great culture and tradition, but do nothing for our country.The asset of the film is Shahrukh Khan, looking ordinary and real but in an extra-ordinary performance. His most real since 'Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa' and his career's best. ARR music is soulful and original. The theme song 'Yeh Jo Des Hai Mera' haunts both in terms of its visuals and wordings.But above all, it's the good intention and the attention to detail, of director Ashutosh Gowarikar that makes wonders for this truly experimental and moving cinema.I can and will definitely view this movie once more, to celebrate it feel and spirit. I can't predict its box office outcome, as the masses love fantasies and escapist cinema. But it's definitely a treat for those who want to see moving and believable films on a large scale. Also if we don't embrace different cinema like this or even 'the torturous but different Musafir' for that matter, we'll continue to get more 'Sarson ka Saag', 'Karva Chauths', 'Maahi Ve' filled designer romance fables from the Chopra-Johar clan! Regardless of the box office outcome, take a bow Ashutosh, Shahrukh and ARR!"
tt0367110,"Ashutosh Gowariker, has really made this movie straight from the heart. It has none of the ridiculous clichés one is typically used to seeing when one sees a story about an India returning home. He has captured something which perhaps no other Indian movie has - that love for ones country can be strong without making an excessively big deal about it.It is a long movie. But I think the rather leisurely pace of the movie is required because it gives enough time for the protagonist, Mohan Bhargava, to come to India (with his mineral water and caravan) and start to fall in love with its beauty as well as understand its incongruities which frustrate us all as well. I thought there were three moments in the movie that captured it all 1. The feeling he gets when he starts to land in India. All of us feel it. I do even today. It's called coming home. 2. The mineral water - that is a classic. In fact it is a character of its own throughout the movie and plays its own part! 2. The boy serving water at 25paise to the train passengers and Mohan Bhargava's reactionI am saddened that Indians both in India and around the world have not liked this movie. It will be remembered as an epic. 2."
tt0367110,A worth watching Movie by Ashutosh Gowariker.Leaves a impression on mind after you have seen the movie.Though there are technical faults in the storyline yet those can be left aside on the backdrop of a heart-touching theme. A theme for the people who are leaving their countries / states in search of a better life without realising the fact that they can create a better living environment at home itself. An insight on the problems of India whose underdeveloped part is somehow or other responsible for itself for the underdevelopment. The social jinx in the rural India which should have been broken long before are now hampering the progress of the villages.The movie is another Gem after Lagaan in the collection of Ashutosh and Indian Cinema as a whole.Great Job by Shahrukh. Exquisite appearance by Gayatri. Grand Show by Ashutosh.Purnendu
tt0367110,"Thank god for swades. Its been ever so often that as Indians we have lamblasted the mushy, one track nonsensical movies that were being churned out by bollywood and yearned for something slightly honest and celebral. And now it seems that the moment has arrived. Swades has finally reached the next level of Indian movie-making with the help of ashutosh, srk and rahman where the execution, the concept and the treatment of the film is at least (i can safely assume) close to world standards. There is no point comparing lagaan (the directors 1st movie) to this movie as his earlier venture was purely fiction with no semblance of realism in it. However this movie has so many ingredients of being a pathbreaker for Indian cinema that its almost scary. The feelings and expectations of an nri set aside, it tells the story of middle and upper class India losing touch with the harsh realities of the sufferings of the less fortunate ones all around us (and the fact that we can do very little to change the ongoing scenario is even more glaring and painful). Besides this the movie also deals with the desires and priorities of humans inspite of the trials and tribulations of daily living.The maturity of the script, the actors and the score makes it a journey of epic proportions without it looking epic at all. The normalcy of the movie is something which might (and hopefully will) change the way cinema is seen and made in India in the future. One can only hope."
tt0367110,"Saw it last night with a packed cinema and I must say Ashutosh Gowariker has done it again. Nice storyline, little slow but he knows how to make a thoughtful film. Really made me think about being an NRI.Great songs, with A.R Rahman Music of course. The actress Gayatri Joshi played her part very well and she looks very beautiful. Definitely a new star. Shah Rukh Khan well is Shah Rukh Khan, one of the best actors of our times and he can play pretty much any part.Best film of the year. Watch it and it will make you think.Its not a masala movie.Intelligent and Thought Provoking. 10/10"
tt0367110,This movie is without doubt ...one of the greatest Hindi movies ever made.This movies combines with superb direction and amazing performances from all the artists.And Sharukh khan..........he comes up with the outstanding performance and proves that...he is an amazing actor....i feel he is not utilized properly by other directors except few for his talent......hope he does more movies like this.Gayatri was beautiful and perfect and no one could have done better than her.The music and background theme is awesome and hits perfectly to the scenes.I watch this movie at least twice in a year.Truly masterpiece from Auhotosh ans Srk.As few jerks say its boring...i promise it does not bore even for a min....i recommend this Gem of movie to all who love movie which is entertaining as well as thought provoking....and truly inspiring.......watch it least once in lifetime.........Swades :)
tt0367110,"A feel good movie about the beauty of India's rural areas and diversity of its people. The movie preaches equality and gentle progression as it says in the English title: we, the people. This message is portrait through a Nasa manager who goes back to visit his nanny and finds love and truth on his way. The experiences he collects during his stay are shown without false sentiments but with the lighthearted spirit one recognizes from Bollywood. Of course with chanting, dancing, a small tear and lots of humor. Enjoy the sympathetic characters and a lost three hour visit to rural India."
tt0367110,"Swades is not just a movie,it is a realization . Each n every people of our country must watch this movie . It is the best movie I have ever seen ( thinking of Mr Satyajit Ray movies also , I have seen all the movies of him ) . It is so down to earth that u don't even think that u are watching a movie . We must realize that we have to do something for this country....Shahrukh Khan has done one of his best jobs in his lifetime....by selecting the movie as well as performance wise.....all the characters of the movie has done a brilliant job .Plz watch this beautiful movie at least once ."
tt0367110,"Why is it that Indian filmmakers seem to believe that every movie, regardless of subject matter, needs to be over three hours long? Is it simply a matter of ""more is better,"" or is there something ethnical or cultural going on here? For indeed, this phenomenon is not restricted to certain specialized genres as it is in American film-making (the sweeping epic, the historical drama, the Broadway-based musical etc.) but seems to extend to films of all types made in that country.Take ""Swades,"" a rather simple comedy/drama about a successful NASA satellite designer named Mohan who returns to his native country in search of his roots and past. He travels to a village where Kaveriamma, the woman who took care of him as a child, now resides. His intention is to take her back to the States with him, so that she can live out the remainder of her life in the lap of luxury and affluence. However, while he's there, he falls in love with a beautiful but feisty and independent young schoolteacher named Gita who wants Kaveriamma to remain where she is. A struggle develops between these two attractive young people who are obviously madly in love with one another but too prideful and pigheaded to realize or acknowledge it.What might have been a meaningful and profound little personal drama at, say, a reasonable 115 minutes, becomes something of an endurance contest at a turgid 186. The story simply isn't compelling enough to sustain our interest for this enormous a length of time. The film does have some pertinent things to say about the caste system, the role of women in society, the need for universal education, and the conflict between traditionalism and modernity in 21st Century India (""swades"" actually means ""we, the people"") - and I'm sure that people in the home country may find these issues more compelling than some of us watching the film in an entirely different part of the world. Unfortunately, writer/director Ashutosh Gowariker seems too addicted to romantic clichés for any of these themes to filter through and register much of an impact. He also employs the kind of corny reaction shots one rarely sees in American films anymore, as well as too-cutesy-by-half musical riffs to highlight the humorous moments so that the presumably unperceptive audience will know when to respond appropriately - like a laugh track in a sitcom or the traditional drum roll of the stand-up comic. One of the reasons why the movie is so long is that the narrative is frequently interrupted by those seemingly obligatory musical numbers without which no true blue Indian film can exist. Some of the these sequences are high-spirited and enjoyable, but I have no idea why every single filmmaker in that country feels compelled to use them in every single film.As the young lovers, Shahrukh Khan and Gayatri Joshi make a handsome, attractive couple, and Kishori Balal provides stability and warmth as the old woman who becomes the bone of contention between the two. And there would be no point in denying that ""Swades"" has moments of point and purpose as Mohan comes to realize the beauty and quality of the land and the people he has left behind. Now, if only a sensible editor could have trimmed the movie down to a more serviceable length, ""Swades"" might have been a film worth watching."
tt0367110,"Definitely a thoughtful movie. Thanks to Gowariker, gives an insight to the rural parts of India, their lifestyle, concise outlook Different treatment of Patriotism, AG is quick to know the pulse of his viewers, SRK has done a brilliant job. I'd read, a leading director who commented on him, that he comes in a package with best designers, director, music, best locations on shoot etc. etc, I strongly recommend him to watch this movie, and would like to know what he could say to this. It was good and a big change to see SRK dancing with children. Star SRK has transformed into character, good!!!. AG has carried simplicity in every angle of the film.Another good thing is the casting, Ashutosh deserve a big applause for this, all faces were apt for the character. Visuals, music, cinematography in short the whole crew a big applause, you guys had done a wonderful job.Truly anticipate seeing such movies ."
tt0367110,"A simple story of a NASA engineer discovering his roots. And his life transformation narrated in a way that stirs your soul. The experiences that the protagonist goes through and the journey the audience takes with him is a must see for any connoisseur of classic Indian cinema.I would rate Swades as Ashutosh Gowarikar's best work. And definitely SRK's best performance till date. If I look back and see. The movie had a great story. Screenplay that was brilliant. Ashutosh's direction was perfect. And SRK definitely stood tall in a restrained yet poignant portrayal of Mohan Bhargava. His best performance till date, yet underrated. Kishori Ballal remains etched in your memory as Kaveri amma. Gayatri Joshi is perfectly cast. Sadly she didn't appear in any movie after Swades, atleast nothing notable. An untapped potential. All other actors leave a mark.Why did it underperform at BO? It came out in 2004. 3 years after the magnum opus Lagaan. There were bound to be comparisons. Both stories had the underlying love for motherland as theme. But were completely in stark contrast in their content.
Lagaan, set in British era, was more of a fight about the protagonist and his village's honor. It had a bad guy, his evil intentions and then protagonist and his ideals. A classic underdog story. David vs Goliath. And we love those stories for sure :)
Swades on the other hand was more about an individual discovering his roots. His inner journey and conflicts. His choice of leaving a comfortable and cozy life to be with his people. It's a simple story minus the melodrama. But so effectively told that it just wins you over.
I think it was the expectations that audience had from Swades that made it underperform.
Please do not miss this gem of a movie"
tt0367110,"Some movies in you life are precious, and this is one among them. I am a movie lover and watch every possible movie released. Swades holds a prima-facie among the limited movie collection i have.I still remember the day when i stood outside the Audio shop in the city next to my village where i traveled over 100km just to get the first copy of the audio cassette, and guess what i grabbed the first cassette that day. Since that day my love for this movie is out of bounds, and still going strong.Believe i am not a fan of Mr.Shahrukh Khan, but after this movie i really fell in love the way he enacted the play. I never missed the release of this movie and watched it the first day.The Aftermath ,9 years later, today, i have completed my medicine degree,this movie made me change my mind to stay with my home place, My beloved parents, friends and everyone in my village. I wanted to pursue my masters in US but i am now a changed mind with pursuing the degree in here in my home land , India.Thanks Mr. Ashutosh for creating this epic master piece. I would be grateful for the rest of my life for this movie you have crafted.The characters simply have life and they are close to hearts, be it Mohan ""NRI"" Bhargava or ""Gitli"" Geeta or the Post Man ""Nivaranji"" who admires the Email as something out of the world invention, the American dream pursuing ""MelaRam"". Every one is astounding in performance, that makes this movie a special one that you would never want to forget for the rest of your life.For all my NRI cousins and friends, do watch this movie and come back buddies, there is more to pursue in here. regards"
tt0367110,"Bollywood seems to be producing great films again. After a long wait ever since the days of Sholay, Kabhi Kabhi, Trishul, 1942- A love story and of course Lagaan, we are treated to a modern day masterpiece. This film was derided by influential sections of the Indian press who were biased to SRKs other release at the time, Veer Zara, but then still emerged triumphant ! SRks best performance ever...even better than Kabhi Haan Kabhi Na or the Yash Chopra/KAran Johars sweeteners. For a debut performance, Gayatri Joshi gives a very composed performance. Memeorable Scenes: SRK: YOu Indians can't take criticism Kaveriammma: YOU INdians ? SRK: Sorry, us Indians Watch it again and again, too good."
tt0367110,"We have been savoring Bollywood films for the past couple of months and we are definitely enjoying the cultural experience. Swades by far has touched me the most, as it not only combines that happy musical abandonment I have come to enjoy about India films, but this one reaches a new level. Swades manages to include the new aspects of India culture, becoming educated and proving abilities (NASA, no less), but superimposing how parts of India don't even have electricity yet.It makes me appreciate my lifestyle here in America, yet the culture and traditions that India possesses is something to be a bit wishful for. As the actor playing Mohan said in the movie, America does have its own culture--somehow it doesn't run as deep as what I viewed in the movie.Enlightening, edifying, and definitely educational. I look forward to sampling more thought-provoking films from India."
tt0367110,"Ashutosh G is to be admired, to take up a subject like this and make a movie, knowing very well that, this is not the real commercial deal. It is unlike the other two mega SRK movies of 2004 (Main Hoon Na, Veer Zara), but this is the REAL stuff ! Obviously if you are expecting SRK to jump around with designer clothes, and colourful songs and dances, this movie is not for you! But on the other hand, if you are aware of the ground reality of India, its people, if you have experienced the rural life, this movie will touch the innermost of you!Music: ARR has few memorable tunes: 'Yun Hi Chala', 'Yeh Jo Desh Hai Tera', 'Sanwariya Sanwariya', 'Yeh Tara Woh Tara' ! Melody based tunes along the lines of Bombay or Dil Se.Cinematography: Could have been much better.The movie is all about its theme. And its highly reflective of the kind of person you are, or life you have led. Not everyone will appreciate the movie as much!The scenes of the small kid selling water in station, or SRK's rent collection from another village are very thought provoking.The movie, however, I felt, appeals to NRI crowd more."
tt0367110,"I gave this a high rating realizing that it isn't Citizen Kane, nor is it Lawrence of Arabia, but it moved me to tears more than once, and made me laugh frequently, and it tackled important issues and held out the possibility of solutions, something Hollywood films used to do routinely.Too many Hollywood films in this era are made for kids in search of quick thrills, and that's fine, except the menu lacks balance. A constant diet of guns, explosions and emotional violence certainly doesn't model well as a reflection of the nation, does it? It is refreshing to find a beautifully acted story of a man who feels the magnetic pull of the homeland and struggles with giving up all his hard-earned wealth and glory to commit himself to others--what a novel idea! Name a major recent film that suggests such a thing! Very real third-world problems are graphically delineated, but as in other Bollywood films, there is always time for song and dance, and it's fun to take a break.I do not claim greatness for this film, but I was highly entertained every minute and admired the craft it took to marry the music, images and story. We used to make films about heroes and creators and except for the recent Lincoln, they remain far and few. Swades reminds me a good deal of Frank Capra films from the 1930's, but with more color, and certainly a good deal more dance."
tt0367110,"This movie could have been so much more... there were some scenes that were absolutely stunning, others that would look stupid in a school play. I had severe problems with 1. The inconsistent pacing (try watching a 3.5 hr movie without a break in a cold theater after a large Coke). The first half rambled on endlessly without songs. Then, just as the second half seemed to acquire momentum, a song would come along to slow things down. 2. The dialogue, which plumbed new depths of imbecility and obviousness in some scenes (whereas others were extremely well-written). 3. The fact that the film raises so many more questions than it resolves. Which is not necessarily a bad thing by itself but the issues were raised haphazardly and without structure.But, the movie has been made with obvious passion and sincerity by people who feel strongly about the problems facing India. The cast (including, surprise! Shahrukh) deliver good performances and the music is eminently hummable. I'd rather watch a failure like this (and it is a failure, even though I gave it a 7) than 90% of the bilge that Bollywood produces."
tt0367110,"After a long, long time I saw a Hindi movie which has no villains, but still illustrates vividly the miseries of life, which has no feuding families but still manages to bring out the realities of love, marriage, and adjustments. There are no corrupt politicians but rather heads of the village, with real issues and real ego; but still clearly human; the real people. There are no events for shock values but still the storyline is gripping. Perhaps it is not for teens and young people in twenties, who would rather be in a dream world idolizing a person with super powers. The movie is as realistic as any of my Desi colleagues I meet everyday at work here away from my Swades. Such a simple story but so well presented. After having to watch stupid Hindi TV soaps every evening where women are either screaming or slapping each other and less said about the male roles the better, it was a real nice change to spend yesterday evening watching this beautiful movie with the whole family. I really like movies that leave me in a happy state of mind. This was definitely the one; a rare one; a jewel."
tt0367110,"I found this movie nice still not that deep and special as expected.When I see the average results of this movie I really don't understand how it has such a high votes. After having watched it one time I have the feeling that either the long dialogs, the funny scenes, the story line, the sport played in the movie and more much be better understood and appreciated IF I was Indian because I didn't understand it totally and didn't like it that much after all.For me it's the kind of movie I'd watch once and never watch it again. Still the history is nice, the songs aren't that much ""special"" yet the actors are good and that's maybe enough to make it appreciated by 84% of people on line.Something strange little bit annoying me: why is Shahrukh Khan smoothing that much from the beginning until the end of the movie? ;-)My result: 7/10 which isn't that much bad yet it could be better :)"
tt1562872,"Zoya Akhtar's Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, through the lives of three friends, presents the world of contemporary Indian youth, who are successful, affluent yuppies. They just enjoy life because financially they have the means to do it. In mood and execution the film is very modern, light, yet it entails complex relationships in family and between friends. Essentially, in this regard, it has an uncanny resemblance to Dil Chahta Hai, though it's an altogether different film and not quite on that level. The movie is relatively realistic, but it is also emotional and, surprisingly enough, quite poetic. The dialogue by Farhan Akhtar is for the most part very good.Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara is captivating, interesting and entertaining, and it captures the beauty of Spain with great mastery. At times this presentation is too perfect, but then it's a movie so that's what audiences want to see. It is beautifully shot, with excellent cinematography working in its favour. The background score is very good, and the songs are very fun and catchy. All these aspects create a lyrical tone that is quite uplifting to watch. Some scenes are just amazingly captured. The one when the guys get out of the water after diving, is pure magic. So is the one which shows them skydiving.Having said all that, the film is far from flawless. While the main moral of the story, that life is only once and should be lived to the fullest, is successfully conveyed, generally speaking, but then at times it becomes over-repetitive and saccharine. Towards the second half, in particular the film tries too hard to be inspiring and feels too larger-than-life, almost to the point of being preachy. The ending is one such instance. Above all, the friendship between the three leads, while generally done decently, often lacks the natural, understated camaraderie it requires (not because they fight, but in spite of it). I don't know what exactly it is, but something is missing there and feels quite forced and banal.Hrithik Roshan finally works as part of an ensemble cast where he doesn't have to carry a film all alone. He plays an imperfect man who grows as a character, and he does it well. Farhan Akhtar is for the first time convincing and he's natural and enjoyable in a meaty role. Abhay Deol, as the flamboyant, playful guy who's unsure of whether he does or does not want to marry yet, is a bit of a disappointment. Deol is according to me the best actor of the three, based on what I've seen before, but in this film his character often lets him down--a sad case of weak writing--as it lacks true complexity.I never thought I'd say that, but Katrina Kaif is surprisingly effective and natural, and her part is actually very well etched out in the script. Laila is lovely, kind, radiant and, probably more importantly, is of mixed ethnicity, which makes her accent justifiable and credible in this film. This may be the benefit, as it eases the work for Kaif, who, instead of focusing on her accent and Hindi line delivery (which was anyway poor), can for one concentrate on the character. She is never great, but she is good. Kalki is better in a smaller part. Speaking of small parts, Naseeruddin Shah and Deepti Naval, in just two brief scenes each, shine.Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara does partially bring forth another step in mainstream Hindi cinema's growth and departure from popular convention. It is thoroughly enjoyable, it has both style and substance, and though in my opinion it is nowhere an extraordinary film and is far from being really great, it is still a worthy and appreciable effort about living life to the fullest and cherishing every moment of it. Worth watching."
tt1562872,"When was the last time you saw a feel good movie? When was the last time you laughed at simple silly conversations, when was the last time you remembered your bachelor days (only if you are married), when was the last time a movie made you think about your life, when was the last time a movie inspired you to enjoy the simple things in life, when was the last time a movie inspires you to let go off your fears..... Well not in the near past, definitely not from Bollywood. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara takes you through the simple moments of life, the life that every one miss out due to their busy schedule, commitments, etc..etc... and the movie does it through the life of three friends and their extended bachelor party trip. The beauty of the movie is that it concentrates on the life of the friends and how they let go their resistance to themselves and their fears rather than showing obscenity that normally rules movies which are based on bachelor party trips. Zoya does a fantastic job in making the viewers feel every part of the movie with a beautiful blend of nature, good camera work, good script and three gifted actors. There is not a moment in the movie which feels out of place, no songs which you feel is there to enhance the marketability of the movie, everything flows smoothly, everything blends so nicely which gives you the feel good factor that you expect from the movie. All the actors were fabulous and were perfect fit for the roles. To start in alphabetic order i will start with Abhay. What to say about this actor, he brings life to his roles and he has proved it over and over in his movies. I couldn't think about any actor who could have blended so well with the character in the movie like Abhay did. There is no replacement for him. I cant enhance on his character as it will give away the plot. The scenes where all the three friends make fun of people through their silly childhood act under the leadership of Abhay can only be carried out well by Abhay.Hritik is an actor who can do wonders when he lands the right roles. When even the new entrants avoids multi starrier movies, he has taken a role where other actors share more or less the same screen space, with no insecurity and no ego. In the movie you get to see a completely different Hritik, with a script which does not glorify him, he is just a friend among the three and he brings life to the movie with his charm and charisma. Farhan was bit of a surprise to me. He has grown as an actor from ""Rock on"" and ""Karthik calling Karthik"". I always found him to be more fit for a serious character than for the joker in the pack act. He does it extremely well. Probably its because of my prejudice that it was hard for me to take him in the role, but i had to let go my resistance.Katrina portrays a character which is similar to her real life, a mix breed of Indian and Brit, a freedom loving, ""live today"" kind of girl. Her combination with Hritik is electrifying. Kalki is such a good actress. Her expressions helps you relate well to the character. There is nothing to give out as a story, its all about three friends on a trip and trying out different things that they never tried before and how those things change there lives. But the beauty is in the details and climax. I think how the movie ends could have been better but song at the end of the movie with the credit makes up for it. Overall Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara impressed me and lived up to my expectation and above. I hope you would like the movie too. But 'hey', everyone has different opinions, the general review by the critics for the last two movies i reviewed were totally against mine. So don't go for the review rather go for the movie and decide for yourselves.Read my reviews on the site www.Movierecycle.com"
tt1562872,"Before going for this movie I was careful not to read anything about it, not watch a single trailer. This extremism mainly comes from my distrust on Indian Media which trashes movies that are comfortably awesome. Okay. If you are planning to go for it, do not read the rest of this. Come back and do it. This movie deserves an open mind. It shouldn't be that you go inside the theater with some invisible strings controlling how you perceive it. Let me tell you it is simple. It is also beautiful. And the combination makes it immense.Right from the first scene, the director makes this his own. I wonder how many directors in this industry will be able to give a complete character definition of the protagonists through a sequence depicting their luggage-packing-styles for a 3 week trip. Zoya Akhtar does exactly that. She is a genius. I'll come back to her.Lets look at the actors. Abhay Deol, Farhan Akhtar, Kalki Koechlin, Katrina Kaif and Hrithik Roshan. Abhay Deol is a stalwart. He has been a part of movies that have changed the face of Indian Cinema. Hrithik Roshan is another great actor. His movies have always contained a central theme of self-improvement. And for me, he is mind-blowing. Farhan Akhtar is a multi talented dude. Acting, singing, directing with equal panache. Any competitors? No. Kalki Koechlin has proved her worth in Shaitan and Dev D.The real surprise in this movie comes from Katrina Kaif. She is amazing in this movie as the NRI diving instructor with high intellect. She embodies the role with such ease that she never looks the out-of-place girl she usually does. And she is hot in a very warm way. Her physicality is projected and used by Zoya in a controlled manner which enhances her beauty.Hrithik is at his best, giving 100% to the role and carrying the transformations in his character so smoothly that at the end you feel happy for him. His journey across his life comes alive on screen through his facial expression. And eyes. The use of sunglasses by Zoya is absolutely perfect.Abhay is the usual casual fellow you could find strewn all over India. But such is his expertise, he makes that guy stand out. Where Farhan and Hrithik have characters with a certain premise, Abhay's Kabir(a) is a free-bird. And boy, how he uses the freedom! A treat to watch, his dialogue throwing style adds a very important spice to the movie. It pierces you.Kalki is good. With a limited screen-time, she fares really well. She has one shriek in the whole movie and one funny sequence while singing ""I'm a hot chick in a hard rock world"". These two scenes show us why she is different. Pretty powerful stuff. The perfect sugar coated knife.Farhan. Hats off. You just blew my expectation ceiling with an atomic bomb. Perfect, infallible comic timing. Add to that the raspy, metal-on-wood voice, the casual sense of style, the few looks of soul-searching and the full blown expression of joy after Sky Diving. What you get is in my opinion the best performance I have seen in some time. Character constructed, deconstructed, resurrected with the absolute smoothness of a tequila shot.Cinematography. The whole movie is pivoted on the use of short range focus. Pure genius. It makes the scenes look alive. Almost as if you are looking at the characters in reality.Locales. Its one thing to choose correctly and absolutely another to use it. ZNMD sells Spain like Rafael Nadal and Barcelona. The azure blue ocean, the gray and dark plateaus, the vibrant green forests, the super sexy roads and a flaming yellow sunset. Breathtaking.Songs. What lyrics. Perfectly picturised. Totally blends into the script.Background score. I can't stop if I start on this. The use of the heartbeat promotes the signature sound from the murky depths of Kal Ho Na Ho to the actual surge of nervous energy it stands for. The use of the silencing technique while slowing up the screen pace creates magic moments. And whoever played the rapturous guitar chords did a great job. Awesome.Dialogues. Great. General stuff mostly but again, the relevance and timing kills it.All these factors combined with the finesse of Zoya creates the unforgettable experience of ZNMD. The movie is about a lot of things. About relationships, about self discovery, about losing control, about life in a microscopic view. But above all, it glorifies friendship, a virtue that is priceless. It will take you through a plethora of emotions, evoked by the various situations faced by Imran, Kabir and Arjun. The situations poised are some real problems the current society is facing like career v/s life, identity crisis, family pressure and relationship maintenance. And truly, they fit the characters.The single thing that separates this movie from other hits is the creation of numerous magic moments. Directorial expertise blends with the awesome crew work to make you jump in mirth, look with awe, feel good from within, suppress a tiny tear drop, dance in your mind and applaud a timely joke. I would recommend this movie to everyone, just like Iqbal. It will give you wings. And it will give you the desire to take flight, to live your life like never before.Finally, the idea of using shayaris to verbally emote key junctions of the movie is brilliant. In Farhan's voice, it adds to the overall positive vibration of the movie and moves you. Excellent. Thank you Bollywood, for making this movie."
tt1562872,"Just saw Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara.. beautiful,adventurous,funny​ ,i m a big Hrithik fan who excels the movie,all the characters are excellent.Three young men take a holiday that changes their lives forever. Kabir (Abhay Deol) is engaged to Natasha (Kalki). Kabir decides to go on an extended bachelor party, before he gets married. A 3-week road trip with Imraan (Farhan Akhtar) and Arjun (Hrithik Roshan), his two best friends since school. The only problem is Arjun is too tied up with work. After much emotional blackmail and cajoling, the boys set off on a journey they were meant to take four years ago. A fantasy holiday they had planned to take after college, which never happened. A road trip where each one gets to do the ultimate sport of his choice and the other two just have to do it with him. Whether they want to or not! STRAIGHT INTO FAVOURITES..:):) Awesome work by Zoya..:) HR,Farhan,Abhay mass...Hrithik and Katrina adds spice to the romantic scenes in the movie..Farhan Akhtar shows a refreshing flair for comedy and has impeccable comic timing...Kalki Koechlin is excellent in her bitchy role of a possessive girlfriend. Naseeruddin Shah is impressive in his cameo. ..superb Love + friendship movie..don't miss..:)"
tt1562872,"No Farhan Akhtar movie has disappointed me - whether he stars in it or directs it. I am not claiming that he makes great movies - I am merely agreeing that his films are funny, intelligent and definitely entertaining.The Hrithik-Farhan-Abhay trio have done a fabulous job. Incidentally, Katrina too is associated with a movie that makes more sense than all her prior films put-together. There are many instances in the movie where it appears that the actors are being themselves rather than actually acting - which is also the underlying theme of the movie. Be yourself and follow your heart, wherever you go, whatever you do. Credit should be given to director Zoya Akhtar. This movie proves that her previous, Luck By Chance (2009) was not just luck. Cinematography and art direction have also been handled well. It was very refreshing to see Indian actors in casual street clothes holidaying in Spain. However, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy are getting way too repetitive with their tunes, many songs give us a feeling that we have heard them before. This is a summer movie that will give you what you seek - humor and entertainment. Wouldn't it be really fun if we could go on a nice little vacation and figure out what we want to do in life ? Wish life could be that simple."
tt1562872,"I have seen the film this morning and all the efforts put in are worth the movie. As expected, this is a good movie about grown up men and their emotional problems, which is naturally expected from the team that gave us Dil Chahta Hai and Rock On.A group of three friends (Hrithik, Abhay Deol and Farhan Akhtar) embark on a road trip in Spain as a part of a bachelor party for Abhay Deol, who is getting married to Kalki, and confused. Hritik and Farhan have their own personal issues too.The movie is a joy ride with subtle comedy. Farhan Akhtar's comic timing is impeccable. The comedy that was written just out of a ladies hand bag is too good.The wafer thin story line is beautifully put on screen with a superb screenplay. The performances are nothing less than your expectations with Hritik in the ensemble. Deepti Naval and Naseeruddin Shah add up to the list of artists.The movie portrays very heavy topics like marriage, love and Work. Yet, due to the sublime comedy you are never bored. I guess that is a mark of excellent script.Here is one line I want to pick up from this movie. Kalki says this line to Abhay Deol, her fiancé. ""You enjoy your bachelor trip. Aakhir shaadi ke baad you wouldn't feel like going around with your friends any more."" And you should see the expressions on the faces of the three guys...And yes, La Tomatina festival, Spainish beaches, and Katrina Kaif were a treat to watch."
tt1562872,"""Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara"" (ZNMD) is a complex, honest, and thoroughly refreshing story about friendship, about love, about choices, about ... well ... the journey of Life (lit. 'zindagi'). Writer-Director Zoya Akhtar takes three characters we might think we've seen before ... but deftly makes them original, fresh, and unexpectedly engaging. Her intelligent script perfectly balances the very real, even painful, personal transformation of each character with moments of joy, wit, charm, and humour.No one's Life Journey is ever quite what one plans!Our protagonists? Three best friends since childhood: Arjun (Hrithik Roshan), now an investment broker in London; Imraan (Farhan Akhtar), an advertising copywriter in Delhi; and Kabir (Abhay Deol), a construction architect in Mumbai. Ten years after college Kabir's imminent wedding impels 'The Three Musketeers -- all for one, and one for all!' -- to finally embark on the many-times-deferred adventure challenge they'd always planned.ZNMD explores whether three grown men can survive a 3-week road trip together *and* still remain friends *and* still be the same people.Think you've heard similar, before? Guess again! Ms Akhtar elevates the basic 'road movie' premise into something rare and sublime: brilliant character-driven comedy never cheap but often laugh-out-loud funny, and so true to life and people each of us actually know that it genuinely moves the heart as well as the mind and funny-bone. As each ZNMD character in turn challenges his own fear, whatever personal demon that has been holding back his life, it becomes our victory, too.See ZNMD and discover: *your* life may change, too!Such strong story and plot would be lost, without great acting.Farhan Akhtar just gets better and better, as an actor, every time out of the gate. Already one of India's best young directors, his deceptively brash but sensitive and layered acting in ZNMD is quiet excellence ... and deliciously funny.Abhay Deol is not exciting, but I like his potential. A good foil for the other two.However the real revelation in ZNMD is, most surprisingly, he whom we might have *thought* most familiar. Hrithik Roshan we see so often in heavy dramatic and/or demanding multi-part roles -- because, let's face it, he's that rare actor who CAN do them, and do them brilliantly well -- that it's easy to forget just how plain damn funny and versatile he can be. Casting one of the world's more notorious compulsive workaholics as, well, a compulsive workaholic? Absolute genius!On the distaff side ... Katrina Kaif. Wow! Where did this performance come from? She's always been beautiful, of course, but in ZNMD for the first time she shows subtlety and depth as an actress. Easily, her very best work to date.Cannot finish without special mention of the fantastic music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy, long my favourite Hindi film composers. Their ZNMD soundtrack perfectly backdrops the film's emotional journey. Irresistibly hummable music spans the full range of moods and emotions, much like our three main characters: everything from amusingly lighthearted ('Senorita', sung by Mssrs Roshan, Akhtar, & Deol) to cool and modern ('Ik Junoon -- Paint It Red') to reflective ('Der Lagi Lakin') and even unabashedly romantic ('Khaabon Ke Parinday').But the rocking 'Dil Dhadakne Do' seems to capture the very Joy of Living ... and that is the ultimate spirit of Zoya Akhtar's ZNMD.Perfect summer movie! 10/10Best film I've seen yet from anywhere in the world, thus far in 2011."
tt1562872,ZNMD..i.e...Fun Adventurous ride that begins with fun and Ends with fun.It's something fresh in Indian cinema and kind of Genre which we haven't seen here in Bollywood.Beautiful cinematography and great cast performances which cherishes the bond of friendship and enjoying life 's every moment to the Fullest.It's for youth and fun and joy of Friendship. A must watch especially for friendship bonding and life beautiful experiences that re-invents and re-define our living and priorities so that we could live life to the Fullest.A recommended watch for all those who Gives friendship full importance.All 3 protagonist male gave mind blowing performances....especially by The Mr. Greek God (Hrithik Roshan)who certainly becoming perfectionist of perfection.Leading Gals Katrina and Kalki forms great support members for dis all out Stellar of a Movie.
tt1562872,This movie has no depth! It is a story of 3 men 2 of which are very rich and one seems very comfortable with money go on an adventure where rich people go. Their struggles are frivolous! The story is frivolous!There is a manic pixie dream girl who saves the main hero's life! It is terrible!
tt1562872,"Films dealing with life-altering epiphanies are always shot in stunning locations. And Hindi films dealing with the same, need a stunning cast as well. A possible rationale: beautiful places relieve stress and bring things into perspective. And beautiful people experiencing divine realizations can hold your perspective on the screen, often resulting in a 'ka-ching' sound at the box office. 'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' (ZNMD) is one such film. In true 'Hangover' meets Vikas-Krishna-Barcelona spirit, the film deals with a bachelor adventure marinated with stories of finding, losing and forgetting love. Kabir (Abhay Deol), an affluent construction tycoon is about to take the marital plunge. But not before he completes a much-postponed trip with school buddies, investment banker (and constantly grumpy) Arjun (Hrithik Roshan) and freestyle flirt Imraan (Farhan Akhtar)."
tt1562872,Regular Hollywood movie addicts can easily predict this movie scenes and only thing engaging is rich visuals of spain coz there is no proper plot and the message given in this movie doesn't suit for normal people who hardly gets time and money to explore things shown in this film in my opinion
tt1562872,"I just didn't get the hype surrounding this movie when i watched it. May be the age when you watch is would have mattered, had i seen it 10 years ago it could have been a different feeling for me, watching it in 2021 in my early thirties, was rather disappointing, mainly because of higher expectation based on rave reviews. Hrithik as in many of his movie is completely artificial in his expressions and acting. Abhay deol did manage to play the role well, so did Farhan. The whole movie is about europe tourism. It's really not more than that. The supposed to be suspense can be seen from mile ahead coming your way (Farhan's father). The message of movie is to enjoy life you must go to Europe and do it as you only get one life. The characters were not relatable at all neither their background stories. In the end i was wondering is this it? People got impressed by travel vlog of europe? Anyways, seems i am in the minority , so i'll end my review here."
tt1562872,"Review in form of an open letter to Farhan Akhtar,Dear Farhan,You simply rock. As director you have created all brilliant films, your debut film Dil Chahta Hai is a cult film, which inspired all directors of India to make fresh looking light hearted urban films. Then came Lakshya, which was not commercially that successful, but was nevertheless a good film. Don, from which I expected nothing, hated the idea as the original starring Big B is one of my most fav Big B film, was splendid and established you as master. As producer, you have attempted fantastic films too. And now as an actor, you are getting better and better day by day. You rocked in Rock On, you were fantastic in LBC and KCK and in ZNMD too you have successfully stolen the show from my favorites Hrithik Roshan and Abhay Deol who have established themselves as good actors.Your role in the film is quite meatier and helps you stealing the show. Hrithik (whom you originally wanted to cast in DCH) is again fantastic in serious-all-business-minded-guy and changed-in-love-living-life-guy both. Abhay Deol is as always dependable, his tricks in the films are hilarious. Chemistry between you three is awesome. It feels like three real friends are on road trip.I hope you make sequel to this as producer, keeping Zoya on director's seat again, as I think, she was brilliant as director. She might have lived her life with lots of male friends as it not for a single moment seems like a film directed by lady director (which was the only minus point of LBC from my point of view). Hoping to see more from her.Dialogues are fantastic and makes one laugh, smile and think for sure. Story, Screenplay and Script are marvelous. Music is in rhythm with film's flow.All positive – No. Something minor which I found not-so-positive was Katrina's suitability for Laila's role and SEL's music. Katrina has done decent work compared to her past films, but fails to convince what her character needs to convince (and though I don't like Kariena that much, but I feel she suited for this role very much) though Hrithik being her counter part balances very well, and Hrithik and Katrina looks good together. SEL's music is not as great as their former films, though manages to please.Fav Moments in the film: Too many. Though listing some of them.1. Kabeer's all tricks 2. Imran's flirt with Laila and her friend 3. Imran's each funny comment 4. Imran – Arjun fights 5. Bagwati 6. Each Poetry recited by Imran 7. The moments which inspires those Poetries 8. In the Air Scenes 9. Imran & Salman's meeting 10. Imran & Arjun's meeting their after 11. Kabeer's Flashback 12. Arjun crying after Underwater 'Meditation'All and over, it's not DCH, it's not Rock On. Though, it has shades of both the films, but it's quite different story to tell and as it has many pleasing moments, one must watch it.A film fan – Hardik Raychanda"
tt1562872,"""Seize the day"", is the whole and soul of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. I was actually quite low on expectations with this movie. But this movie has turned out to be a vagabond of friendship, love, adventure, emotions and above all, LIFE.I always believed that Farhan Akhtar is a good showman. Right from Rock On!!, Luck By Chance and the duh Kartik Calling Kartik. But this movie has proved it that he has all the elements that are needed in an actor. He can dance, can cry (can sing of course) and now, he can make you laugh. Abhay – Farhan – Hrithik are the three mesquiteers.Zoya Akhtar is one more reason to watch this movie. The way she directed Luck By Chance was not all serendipitous, and she has proved it. ZNMD is all her baby. The male bonding penned and filmed by her is pleasant. The Spanish locations are exotic. Dialogues (By Farhan Akhtar) are real and spontaneous. Movie runs with its own good slow pace, which is very much needed for the road movies. Many scenes halt the heart and literally put you on an adventure mode.Movie would have been a way better if songs were good. Editing needed a bit more stitch. I have no complaints regarding the length of the movie, as I can watch this Spanish odyssey for more than two hours with a tub of pop corn and a coke.Overall, this road movie is a trip to remember."
tt1562872,"'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' is a Stunning film. Zoya Akhtar delivers a film, that is full of human-emotions & energy. The Writer-Director has handled the film fabulously and she indeed deserves immense praise. Also, the performances by all the actors aboard, are top-notch! The story follows three friends – Arjun, Imraan and Kabir, who set off on an adventure in Spain, that make them iron out their differences and teach them to seize the day.'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' is amongst The Finest Films of Recent-Times. It gets almost everything right. The Writing Material is super-strong and offers 3 very interesting protagonists to lead it's narrative. All the 3 central characters are diverse, yet very compelling to absorb. Their journey is full of energy, realization & hope.Zoya Akhtar & Reema Kagti's Screenplay is water-tight. Akhtar's Direction on the other-hand, is fabulous. Cinematography by Carlos Catalan, is awesome! The lens-man has captured the exotic locales of Spain, with ease. Editing is decent. Art Design is perfect. Music by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is satisfactory.Performance-Wise: Each and Every Actor is Top-Notch! Hrithik Roshan is spectacular. The highly-talented actor is in complete form once again. Farhan Akhtar is first-rate. Abhay Deol is natural to the core. And the On-Screen Chemistry between Hrithik-Farhan-Abhay, is arresting. Katrina is passable, while Kalki Koechlin is excellent. Deepti Naval & Naseeruddin Shah are routine in cameos.On the whole, 'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' is a winner all the way. Two Thumbs Up!"
tt1562872,"Let go of yourself - It's the perfect tag line for this movie. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara is one of the few Bollywood movies which stays behind with you even after the movie is over.Its basically a story of 3 longtime friends - Arjun(Hrithik Roshan), Imran(Farhan Akhtar) and Kabir(Abhay Deol). Kabir is getting married to Natasha(Kalki) and before marriage wants to go on a road trip to Spain with his best buddies, all in accordance with a pact which they had made a long time ago. Arjun is a stockbroker who is only interested in earning as much as he can till the age of 40 and then retire. Imran, being the joker of the pack, is a writer struggling hearts and hearts with a very important but unspoken thought. Katrina Kaif plays the role of Laila, who is their diving instructor in Spain and loves to live life to its fullest.Spain has never been presented so beautifully. Some of the locales are truly breathtaking. The cinematography is bang on. In terms of performances, everybody chips in. If Hrithik Roshan can emote through his eyes, then Farhan Akhtar's one liners and comic timing is brilliant. Abhay Deol is his usual self, showing he can hold his own be it commercial cinema or offbeat cinema. Katrina Kaif, is a surprise. She is surprisingly good, and her chemistry with Hrithik Roshan is too die for. Kalki doesn't have much to do, but is good. But the real star of the movie is its screenplay and editing. The skydiving and underwater scenes are shot beautifully. Zoya Akhtar is back in the director's seat after the critically acclaimed Luck By Chance. After watching this movie, you wonder why she doesn't make movies more often. The dialogs by Farhan Akhtar and the poems by Javed Akhtar deserve a special mention. The music by Shankar, Ehsaan & Loy is peppy. The songs Khwaabon ke parindey and Senorita however hog the limelight.Simply put, ZNMD is a beautiful ride. Its by no means a Dil Chahata Hai or a Hangover, but it holds it's own special place."
tt1562872,"One premium road movie, brilliant locales, glamorous faces, beautiful characters, and a thrilling joyride! This movie can be seen over and over. But there's so much more than the cinematic or entertainment value - so much to learn from the Spanish trip. It asks you many questions:@ You can decide to slog and mint money till a certain age, but who knows you'd live through that age to enjoy your riches? @ You may be a nice guy who wants everyone around him happy. But would you do that at the cost of your ONE life? @ You may hate (or be jealous of) the happy-go-lucky guy around you who never takes nothing seriously and is yet cool. But don't you know everyone has their fair share of pain?Through these questions, and by portraying the power of love in our lives yet again (though in a Smarter-Bollywood-Ishtyle), Zoya makes you believe in the concept of One-Life! Though nothing is probably new in the movie, the entire package is surprisingly spiritual!The 3 friends take a different take on bachelor's party, and decide on a 3-week trip to Spain. As promised years ago, they indulge in one adventure sport of each of their choices, and the other two join in unconditionally. Surprisingly, these thrilling adventures set them free as they take on land (bull chase), water (scuba diving) and air (sky diving). In the run, they realize the importance of, or rather living each moment of, the celebration called life. Love, family, friendship... there's a lesson of value on each of those, sprinkled abundantly with humor. The movie starts simple, slowly getting into the groove. And before you realize, you'd fall in love with life all over again. Surprisingly spiritual!The tears in Hrithik's eyes after the scuba dive, the 3 boys holding hands during the sky dive, and they joining each other in the last leg of the bull-chase event would remain in the viewer's heart for long. And most of us would lookout to grab a copy of the impactful ""shayaris"" of the movie. Akhtars, take a bow!"
tt1562872,"If while you are watching Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara you notice that things seem very familiar, don't be surprised. After all, it's a road trip film...and many similar films have been made over the years. This isn't so much a complaint as an observation....and the film has many of the usual clichés you'd expect in such a movie. Yet, fortunately, it's still an enjoyable though not exactly original film.When the film begins, Kabir (Abhay Deol) has just gotten engaged and tells his fiancée about his plans before the wedding. Instead of a bachelor party, he wants to go on a three week trip to Spain...something the three of them have been planning for years. The most obvious problem about this trip is Arjun (Hrithik Roshan). Although amazingly handsome, Arjun is a workaholic....and anal to the core (and not in a good way). This is a common archetype in this sort of film and the fact that he'd soon meet a free-spirited woman and would learn to let go of his fears and emotional constraints is no surprise at all. His story is enjoyable but the most clichéd.Imraan (Farhan Akhtar) is the joker of the three. Yet, this is a facade...as he's struggling with daddy issues which he might be able to face while on this road trip.And, then, finally there's Kabir. There's more to his story than he's about to marry a very rich woman. When the two other friends meet her, they are surprised at how controlling and jealous she is...and it's too much so. They want to tell Kabir their concerns about his upcoming marriage...but they aren't sure how he'll take this.Not surprisingly, all these issues are magically resolved by the end of the film...which is pretty typical of such a film. But the locations are lovely, the acting quite nice and the film enjoyable. Worth seeing...but a tad overrated in my mind."
tt1562872,Movie is amazing but in some point it look like the movie is being stretched comedy is comparitvly low as compared to other movies you can watch it if you want to see a movie like yjhd etc otherwise the movie is goodd.
tt1562872,"I do appreciate the fact that certain movies have they're own sweet pace. But when seemingly nothing happens on the screen for long stretches of time, it can be hard to tolerate.On the upside, the movie has very good performances by the three leading actors, my favorite being Abhay Deol. The story is average, but certain bits are brilliant. Like the tale of Farhan and his father played by Naseeruddin Shah. There are no clichés here, just the real portrayal of what actually happens in life.Abhay and Kalki's story is good too, but ruined by the idiotic ring scene. Hrithik's story could have been there but the whole romantic angle pretty much ruined it. The songs were below average, unlike the hype. Katrina and Kalki have their bit roles, which they do not seem do deserve, going by the sub-par performances they put in.This movie could have been much better without the love angles, and without Hrithik's unnecessarily intense performance. A light hearted movie needs to be just that.Give it a skip if you have something better."
tt2125608,"This documentary really grows on you. As the story and the search begins, you slowly but surely get caught up in the narrative. For me the amazing part of this journey is the composure and serenity of Rodriguez himself. Despite the lack of recognition in his own country, he continued to lead a rich life filled with hope and creativity. Just looking at his 3 beautiful daughters is testament to this. The sound tracks are really wonderful and take you back to the 60s and 70s. Another interesting facet of this movie is the exploration of the overthrow of Apartheid. Many who embraced the music of Rodriquez were Africaaners who were looking for change and a better life for everyone in their country. You come out of this movie believing in a better world."
tt2125608,"I caught this movie at an advanced screening at the UN during Mandela week and I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the movie and even more enthralled to discover this long, lost gem of music. The movie revolves around an up-and-coming Rock'n'roller from the 70s who recorded two albums and then disappeared into obscurity. His music was lost in the US but by a strange coincidence becomes a cult hit in South Africa and becomes a symbol of rebellion for the underground white, anti-apartheid sub-culture. The documentary is a lovely journey of discovery of the south africans who try to find the roots of this enigma and re-discover his music. I won't spoil too much but for fans of Dylan like music, this might be a long, lost gem and music that perhaps, at least now, deserves more recognition and appreciation."
tt2125608,"The Landmark Theatre in West LA is a tough crowd but they were laughing and crying and when it was over they were applauding. This is what movie magic is all about. I wandered in and was blown away. Where can I get the soundtrack?? Holy! Crap!! Sixto is what Dylan could have been. That's right he's better than Bob. Better writer, better vocalist by tenfold. Unlike The Jester this guy never sold out and walked the talk until the bitter end. I've always believed the world's best talent goes unrecognized most of the time but the story of Sixto Rodriguez puts that theory into the ""true"" category once and for all and I will never doubt it again. Please recognize this man's work! Hopefully his daughters will continue to work toward that end both in the USA and South Africa."
tt2125608,"This film was by far our favorite at the True/False Film Festival in Columbia Missouri this past spring.The delights of ""Searching for Sugar Man"" are revealed along the way, as the story unspools over decades and continents. I BEG YOU to cover your eyes and ears if you happen to see a trailer at your local indie theater - the art of the trailer is apparently a lost one, and most of the surprises are spoiled in the promotion prepared for this film.The director received a well-earned standing ovation at True/False, and wept - he and other directors said that T/F was the first audience of ""real people"" to see their respective films, apparently Sundance is peopled with ""not real people""?And be prepared to have the music playing in your head for some time to come."
tt2125608,"Who would know that an unknown album from an unknown artist in 1970 (Rodriguez) would become a huge phenomenon in South Africa? As big as say, Paul McCartney. Rodriguez himself was never aware of his huge success, as well as most other Americans. This film traces two hardcore fans as they trace clues around the globe trying to find out what happened to this man. Did he commit a gruesome suicide as rumors say? If so, when and where? Almost nothing was known of this mystery man. The film unfolds a story that cannot be believed by any party. Not the South Africans, nor the filmmakers, or any member of the Rodriquez family. A story that you would swear would not be possible in this day and age of digital communications."
tt2125608,"Rodriguez (Sugarman), is one of the greatest men I have ever known.This isn't a review, at least I don't consider it one; I don't review on IMDb, and there's a good chance I never will; but I feel compelled to leave my experience and thoughts, though briefly, here.I saw this movie today knowing nothing about the subject material or the man himself; after leaving the theatre into a dimming sunset I texted my friend ""I have a new hero.""That is probably﻿ the greatest praise I have ever gave a film.Soulful, touching, heartrending and uplifting, this film------ you cannot write this, you cannot make this up, it is a story of true brilliance and daunting inspiration. There is so much to commend, praise, remark about this movie... but honestly I don't want to cite any one thing because it would spoil the experience of watching the story unfold and the mystery of Sugarman being shaped weakened. The bottom line is: It is a story that is too real, poignant, and far-fetched to exist anywhere on a writer's board or in a screenplay; this is why documentaries will never die, and they will always have a reserved place in the realm of cinema, films of fiction and artistry just cannot pierce the depth that this one finds. It is one of the greatest documentaries I have ever seen, possibly the greatest. I cried throughout the picture. A must-see. I write this review with the intention that I hope to encourage others to go see this movie: If you do you won't regret it and if you see it years later on television, you'll regret you didn't take the chance when you had it."
tt2125608,"I'm going to add my voice such as it is to the chorus of accolades for ""Searching For Sugar Man"". I loved it. It is indeed an incredible true story about a folk singer named Rodriquez who became a sensation in South Africa while remaining in obscurity in his native US. He's not the first person to be given the boot in his hometown (the Bible has something to say on this subject) but upon listening to the wonderful soundtrack of this film it is a sad commentary. There's plenty of humor here as well in this tale of parallel universes: one in which Rodriquez is Elvis and another where he's scarcely a blip on the radar. The film begins as an investigation by curious fans seeking to learn about the whereabouts of Rodriquez and what may have happened to him. The stories circulating about him are not promising but they are undaunted and continue to search for answers. I think everyone who sees ""Searching For Sugar Man"" will be thankful that they did."
tt2125608,"This movie is a MUST SEE. If you are a musician or songwriter and you have ever questioned the importance of what it is that you do, you need to see this film. This was the most inspiring thing I have ever seen. Aside from the unbelievable story, the cinematography had some very great moments and not to mention a stellar sound track. I am recommending this film to everyone I know. The only drawback is that because it is an indie film, it is very hard to find. It is only playing in one theater in my area (DC), and that's West End. I really hope this films picks up and begins showing in more theaters. Until then, I will continue to promote this film via word of mouth because I believe in it so much. ...Amazing things happen."
tt2125608,"Talented Detroit troubadour could have been a star, but his 1970s albums fail to sell and he is consigned to a life of obscurity and hard labor, until rediscovered by millions of adoring fans he never knew he had. This is inspiring stuff, a moving feel-good movie with a detective plot, as a record store owner and a journalist hunt down the enigmatic Rodriguez, whose album Cold Fact made him an anonymous superstar in South Africa.This is a great piece of manipulative filmmaking, but as a documentary it asks more questions than it answers, and never lets the facts stand in the way of a good story. First up we are told Rodriguez was more famous than the Rolling Stones in South Africa, artistically his only peer was Bob Dylan, and he was a leading inspiration in the struggle against apartheid. Come on. Really? Then, based on unsubstantiated guesstimates from ""half a million"" to ""millions"" of album sales, the film asks where the royalties went, but doesn't follow through. They interview Rodriguez, who surely could have answered this question, along with many others, but we see little of the man himself, except for wistful shots of him looking out a window, while his daughters and the South Africans do most of the talking.I wanted to see Rodriguez, but this becomes more a story of the South Africans and their feeble attempts to track him down. These included putting his picture on milk cartons and spreading rumors of his self-immolation on stage, which sounded more like attempts to promote the myth ahead of his tours of South Africa. Also, the movie implies Rodriguez was unheard of outside South Africa, but Cold Fact was also popular in Australia, where Rodriguez toured in the late 70s and then with Midnight Oil. I know, I was a fan and had a copy of the album, as did most of my friends. We are also told he survived his life after music by working as a demolition man. Nice hard luck story, but an internet search reveals he was also a teacher and social worker, and the movie quickly passes over his graduation from university.Rodriguez was a unique talent, I loved his music, and this film does a great job of giving this humble man the recognition he deserves. It is a moving cinema experience and well worth seeing, but this is faction as much as fact, which is carefully excised to fit the myth."
tt2125608,"While ""Searching for Sugar Man"" is, more than anything else, unquestionably a testament to Rodriguez's craft and humility, it is frankly manipulative to suggest that he had no popularity anywhere but South Africa. I have personal memories of ""Cold Fact"" being an integral part of the musical soundscape in Australia during the early to mid 70's, particularly in the surfing community, and he was popular there before he caught on in South Africa. He actually toured Australia in 1979, and in 1981 he opened for Midnight Oil on their Australian tour. The message of Rodriguez's musical journey is undeniable but the filmmakers' omission of facts to make a sensational story even more sensational, is crass."
tt2125608,"Honestly i felt a little abused by this Documentary. I think the story is great, it is a very nice subject with a very large panel of possible angles, directions. And what we have here is a succession of clichés, fanatics that keeps telling that everything was ""the best thing of their life"", that Rodriguez arrived on earth to play the best music of humanity, to save a country... Catchy screen effects, unnecessary romantic descriptions, dramatic silences in the middle of testimonials...I think it is sad, because once again i think this is a very interesting and colorful story, but completely ruined by the choice of making a superhero movie out of it. I don't think it needed that."
tt2125608,"This is one of the best music docs ever made! The story about Sixto Rodriguez misfortunes and fortunes is almost to good to be true. It's like a fairy tale, only that this is real life. Swedish film maker Malik Bendjelloul treats the story with great respect and construct the film in a way almost like a thriller without a dead second and the end will not leave a single eye dry. Cinematographer Camilla Skagerstrom made an excellent job in creating a beautiful movie and the music (all by Rodriguez)makes a great soundtrack and it is hard to believe that this musical treasure was forgotten for so many years. Not only is this a strong personal portrait of a grate musician but it also makes you wonder about the mechanics of fame, success and the music industry."
tt2125608,"Greetings again from the darkness. I make no apologies for my tendency to have higher expectations and be more demanding of documentaries than other films. When dealing with a real subject, event or person, there is no place for fabrication or embellishment. The truth must stand (and entertain) on its own. Filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul has no such issue given his fascinating, almost jaw-dropping story of musician Sixto Rodriguez.Described as Dylan-esque, Rodriguez was a folk singer and songwriter who put out two albums: Cold Fact (1970) and Comng from Reality (1971). Despite critical raves, the album sales were minimal and Sussex/A&R dropped him. After that, the story got a bit hazy. Urban Legend had Rodriguez dousing himself with gasoline while onstage, and committing suicide by lighting himself up. Mostly he just seemed to disappear, not simply fade away.Nearly incomprehensible in today's age of internet communication, the Rodriguez songs became anthems for the anti-apartheid whites in South Africa. The music reached the country through bootleg copies and the popularity grew. We meet a Cape Town record store owner and indie music supporter names Stephen Segerman who describes Rodriguez as ""bigger than Elvis"" in South Africa. In the late 1990's a world wide web manhunt began.What happens after that ... I will leave it to the film. Just know that this documentary is a blend of Mystery, Intrigue, Urban Legend, Who-done-it, and Where are they now? There is a brief interview with Clarence Avant, the owner of now-defunct Sussex Records, during which he provides the only real insight into the music industry underbelly. Additionally, so much of the story goes unexplained. So many questions unanswered ... even unasked! However, the story itself, and Rodriguez the man, are so amazing, that the entertainment and intellectual value of the film remains intact.Since the vast majority (99% plus) of us have never previously heard of Rodriguez, the film does a nice job of integrating his songs in a manner that allows us to get a real understanding for the musical genius and why the critics (and South Africa) fell hard for it. This is a fascinating story and captivating film, despite lacking in ""the rest of the story"" department."
tt2125608,"This is my very first review, about an amazing, amazing story, worth writing a first review, It's about the search of a guitar player known as Rodriguez, who in the 70's with only two albums, apparently He doesn't have any success in the U.S. but unknowingly he is huge in South Africa, it is a story full of hope, almost like a fairy tale, but still a documentary, so it makes it even more unbelievable, the storyline is well done, the editing places the pieces correctly, building expectation, making the viewer a part of it, interviewing the right people, unveiling the nature of the humankind, the photography is beautiful and the use some amateur footage, combines to ensure the historical value, delivering a well crafted movie, that you won't forget. highly recommended."
tt2125608,"A KVIFF viewing of this demystifying documentary of a miracle would never find a copycat in the digital-era, Rodriguez ""The Sugar Man"", an American minstrel in the 1970s who has sold a sensational figure of records in South Africa while being exclusively oblivious in USA, and when rumor says he died in a suicide attempt while performing it on stage, the story seems to reach its cul-de-sac. But two South Africans, take the onerous task to dig out the mystery behind (including the director himself), and eventually the truth has been disclosed in a quite satisfying way both on screen and off screen. First of all, Rodriguez's songs (from his albums COLD FACT 1970, COMING FROM REALITY 1971, and a piece from his never-released third album) have prevailed in the entire film's narrative, which after a first-time listening, feels more affinity with Bob Dylan's Folk Rock tunes, most of which pertain to lower-class or working-class self-inspection, definitely have their own mark of time. The poignancy has been simmered halfway through when the story has a dramatic twist and leads to the second half of the film into a different angle of revelation, an enigmatic fetish figure's condescendence into the real world. And a poetic license has to be introduced to his personal life as de-iconization is always a tough call to make. Then, about what prompted Rodriguez's case so unique? The film seems to be a bit withdrawn in unraveling the real reason behind it (a deliberate conspiracy theory is never in the picture), indeed, even there were merely 40 years before, we already have forgotten how things stand at then, and this could be a scarier discovery. By the way, the film has a very audience-friendly approach, and if you are a music enthusiast, this film will be a delectable choice to be enchanted by the pure magic of music."
tt2125608,"OK. I was not familiar with Rodriguez before this doc. He has some interesting tunes, some with very poetic lyrics and an interesting voice -no doubt he was talented. To place him in any league with Bob Dylan is a major stretch. There's a lot of gaps in the man's history that, for some reason, the writers didn't want to cover: how he got to the States, his wives, did he have a drug problem, why did he quit performing...? Why weren't any of the S. African distributors asked if they had their canceled checks or receipts from Sussex Records? Why was the live concert footage absolutely horrific when Rodriguez performed many times after being ""found""? There's also no mention of any attempt of Rodriguez to follow up the original early '70s album releases with any performances. Why not keep going? Many artists fail for many years, but they keep at it. Something happened that is not talked about. It's an interesting story, but there are too many gaps and non-disclosures for me personally."
tt2246779,"The thoughts and feelings of comedian John Mulaney: a pleasant, nearly-30-year-old man, who enjoys making fun of himself and others.I love the great opening with the throwback to 1980s television. I love how he claims the phrase ""on the phone with Blockbuster"" is now an outdated and antiquated expression. I love the differences pointed out between the word ""midgets"" and the N-word...The inclusion of Amy Schumer was a bit odd, considering she has no lines whatsoever. A wise use or a waste of good talent? Anyway, an excellent stand-up performance from a bright, relatively young comedian. I hope he does more specials and tours. I would buy a ticket."
tt2246779,"Comedian and Saturday Night Live alum John Mulaney's first Netflix Special is a rock solid ride for any stand up comedy fan. John's hilarious takes include stories about his physique, his childhood and family, his girlfriend, his favorite TV shows, Ice-T in Law and Order SVU, and an encounter with a homeless person he met in New York City. His style is very much an preppy young man who speaks fast and fits in as many jokes as possible per minute. He doesn't really tell jokes, he tells stories with his own hilarious takes on them. The pace is fast and and nonstop. This special is arguably John at his best."
tt2246779,"Excellent standup special. A traditional set that features many surprising one-liners and nuggets of wisdom while subtly integrating personal stories that span his entire life. In his first Netflix special, Mulaney really throws down the gauntlet and delivers a hilarious, inspired hour of comedy."
tt2246779,"I just discovered John Mulaney and have been watching his specials on Netflix. Each one was very funny but this one.. man... this was one of those laugh out loud, crying a little bit, routines. Especially the end. He saves the best for last. I have watched other Netflix specials and I nearly crack a smile at ouse of the stand ups.. but this guy is hysterical."
tt2246779,"John Mulaney, a staff writer for Saturday Night Live, takes the stage in this Comedy Central standup show. He starts out pretty slow, talking about how people thought he was Asian as a child, and the audience is appreciative, but either they've been warmed up or there's some canned laughter in there. By the halfway mark, though, his pace of jokes has picked up. He's on a roll and he's pretty funny -- the laughter in the background still sounds canned, or at least as if the volume is turned up when he pauses for breath.Even when he tells stories about himself, about his period as a drunk, Mulaney does not vary his pacing much. Early in the show, a bit slower, later in the show, a bit faster. Although the stories are good and well told, they lack a sense of person that I prefer in a comic until the last one. I don't know if you will have the patience to wait for it."
tt1620933,"The pair has given us the unforgettable ""Haasil"" and they are back again with ""Paan Singh Tomar"".The movie has an excellent script, very well supported by the actors and their performances. Irrfan khan does an incredibly good job with the character. Mahie Gill has done equally well and she is really growing as an actor.The script and its originality is the strongest point of the movie. The direction of the movie is also flawless... Tigmanshu Dhulia must be praised for picking up this script and turning into an excellent movie. Must Watch"
tt1620933,"Watched it in the London Film Festival yesterday. Its a star of a movie. Great tight script, super acting, and great direction. All the actors have done a great job but Irfan is just magnificent- he is turning up as the next Nasruddin ShahEveryone in the cinema seemed to enjoy the movie and the director got a nice applause in the end.My worry is that this movie might not get a wide release, specially abroad - I hope UTV does it best to publicise and release it as much as it can.Well recommended !!!!"
tt1620933,"This is my first time, so please forgive me in case of any mistake...Just watched this movie with my friends. If SRK & Salman could do 10% of Irrfan's acting,I would not mind calling them superstars. Hats off to Irrfan Khan and the movie.....10/10 !! What a great performance delivered by Irrfan khan. After watching a number of dumb movies released recently, Paan Singh Tomar is like a boon for every Indian movie fan. The director Tigmanshu Dhulia is successfully able to tell the biopic how a former national champion athlete is turned into a Dacoit in a cricket obsessed country. A must watch for everyone.....Highly recommended !!"
tt1620933,"In an era where box office success more often means 'No script and mediocrity' in Bollywood, once a while comes a gem like 'Pan Singh Tomar'. Irrfan comes into his own, well immersed into his character...he takes the audience on a trip which brings out a range of emotions from patriotism, guru bhakti, helplessness and finally revenge. Though the language is thick Chamabl dialect but Irrfan bridges that gap with a masterful display forcing you to laugh, cry and feel his pain. Tigmanshu Dhulia is among the rare breed of bollywood directors along with Anurag Kashyap who have the knack of picking up great scripts and turning them out into movies which have the right mix of real acting and appeal to please both the masses and multiplex audience. The movie is a must watch...go out and enjoy the wonderful experience of watching the haunting Irrfan in action...bow your heads to the person who has grown from Salaam Bombay to Haasil to Maqbool."
tt1620933,"I saw this in a theatre.
The acting in this film is the shinning point. Especially the main actor Irfaan khan made a great impression on my mind by his excellent acting skill. Irfaan excellently potrayed the emotion of a ""runner"" who is suffering from pain, frustration and exhaustion, but he is not giving up. The rest is the portrayal of a man who has never had it easy in his life but nonetheless keeps his heart. The screenplay is brilliant. Being a biopic of an army guy/athlete who turned into a dacoit won't b a happy/fun movie. It's a very sad movie. But Irfann did manage to evoke some light moments by his sheer one liners n acting. Imagine an athlete who's very good in running has to run away from police. The direction was good n the cinematography was good capturing the harsh, dry, rural difficult terrain."
tt1620933,"Paan Singh Tomar, national steeplechase champion, nephew of a Dacoit or ""Baaghi"" as Paan prefers to call it, an army soldier wants to be in army sports because they don't have restriction on eating food. The interesting plot builds on it and takes you to a whirlwind journey of his life, which tickles you, inspires you, and ultimately asks you some very uncomfortable questions.Tigmanshu Dhulia paints the canvas with natural but vivid emotions, he has surely pulled it off. All characters have color of their own, but Irrfan, has just delivered a performance which will make him stand in league of extraordinary men. He is convincing as middle aged dacoit, and it is pleasant surprise that he looks as convincing as young army soldier running on track in shorts, which his wife thinks he shouldn't wear as women stare at them.Mahie Gill has restricted territory but like in all her previous films, she has supported the scenes well. All other characters have just beautifully fallen in place. Director has not compromised with authenticity and has retained the language as spoken in the area where movie is set, don't worry English subtitles are there to help you out if you miss some of the dialogs.The romance between husband and wife has been handled with gentleness, with sequences such as the couple sends their children to buy ""lemon-choos"" so that they get some time alone. The movie could have been crispier and shorter n second half when plot moves to Chambal as Paan plans to exact his revenge. Director has sensibly not inserted any songs in the movie as they are not required at all, compliments to the team for this common sense. The background score, especially during races compliments the beautiful cinematography.Overall the movie is a treat to eyes and ears. A must watch ! Compliments to Tigmanshu as he just builds on the skill and craftsmanship he displayed in Haasil and Sahib Biwi aur Gulam. Dhulia leaves you with credits to forgotten heroes of sports who died penniless and without any recognition."
tt1620933,"A die-hard patriot and an international level athlete who is forced to become a dacoit or should I say 'Baaghi'. Commendable performances by almost the entire cast right from Irrfan Khan to the nervous journalist (Bijendra Kala). Mahie Gill matches steps with Irrfan in a fiery and yet restrained performance. I hand my hat to Tigmanshu Dhulia for crisp dialogues, subtle humor and bringing out the Chambal live to you. You can actually feel the grime and dust of the infamous land. Needless to say Irrfan Khan has delivered superlative performance. He has defined what is called as an 'Effortless Performance'. I hope that this movie brings him the most deserved laurels as he brought the same to the movie. 'Irrfan Khan is Pan Singh Tomar'. Period."
tt1620933,"India is probably one of the few countries in the world with various distinct cultures and their own history. In such a nation there were (and are) innumerous people whose life contains all ingredients for a nail-biting tales but sadly biopics are hardly explored in the country. Tigmanshu Dhulia showed guts to pen a script on one of unsung heroes of Indian sports Paan Singh Tomar and end result is a captivating cinema that explores many facets of our system. Paan Singh Tomar is an interesting journey of a loyal soldier and a brilliant athlete (infact a national pride) who transforms into a notorious ""dacoit"" thanks to the 'system"". In a flashback mode the movie deals on the drastic transformation of this loyal army-man into a notorious dacoit (Baaghi as referred by Paan Singh himself). In a linear and simple story PST tells about the plight of an athlete who had brought honours for his own country. Negligence of system is highlighted through his sad tale and the story revolves on framework after independence when seeds of corruption & anti establishment were germinating in full swing. In one sequence Paan Singh tells a journalist that how he was ignored by media when he won medal in steeple chase race in an international army sports meet but now when he was in the other side of the law playing hide-and-seek with the police the journalists are pouring down to get interviews. Another pain stacking sequence shows Paan Singh going to local police to lodge a complaint but he was humiliated by the inspector and even insulted the gold medal which he won for his own country. Tigmanshu dhulia' eye for detailing needs to be acknowledged. While writing the script Dhulia ensured that the audiences identify with the character and gets involved with the proceedings. The crowds were cheering in the initial reels when Paan Singh's potential as an athlete was displayed following which his cry for justice which was put down by the corrupt system. As the film reaches the climax the neglected scenario of athletes indeed touches the emotional chords of the audience. Dhulia's execution makes you think as you leave the theatre. In terms of technicalities Editing and Art department deserves mention. Dhulia's direction is complimented by Irfan Khan who played the role of Paan Singh Tomar with perfection. His nuances, dialogs, expression, body language speaks about a perfect army men. Brownie points should be given to him for his efforts to shape his body at this age and mould himself as the young energetic athlete. His dialogue delivery in the later reels reflected the strive within as he becomes a rebel with a cause. ""Bihad mein baghi hote hai, dacoit toh parliament mein bante hai"" – this dialogue will be remembered in from now on. A performance that deserves full marks and demands awards, this one is easily one of Irfan's career best performances. The supporting casts were appropriate in their roles. Mahie Gill as Tomar's wife gave a good performance again. Vipin Sharma was a treat to watch in role of Major Masand, a senior to Tomar and one who believed in his potential. Brijendra Kala is as usual dependable and brought a comic flavour as a journalist. With the current scenario of the nation movies like Paan Singh Tomar needs to be made and promoted which injects ""thoughts"" inside audience in an entertaining way. It's when the movie ends, and the names of four Indian national champions who died penniless are shown, ""Paan Singh Tomar"" hits the most. Indeed a fitting tribute to unsung heroes of Indian sports. This movie needs to be watched and pondered upon. Tigmanshu Dhulia : Take a bow."

tt1620933,"A stunner.. An Indian Rambo, far far away from the horse-borne dacoits and cheesy dialogs of similar films. Reportedly based on the life and times of an Indian army subedar, the film is a piece of history. That an army man finds civilian life difficult is well known. But this man took up arms because of the failure of the civilian administration to address his problems, as well as the army's failure to intervene, or at least coordinate with the administration, so that an illustrious ex-army man like Paan Singh had to undergo the travails that he did.This film is a lesson on how to make films, which are entertaining, and not over-the-top. It is also a history lesson, for those in power, who see this sort of tragedy occurring in the lives of common people, but do nothing, till trouble comes knocking at their own doors.Hats off to the team of PAAN SINGH TOMAR - the film. May their tribe increase."
tt1620933,"Somewhere in the sandy and hilly terrains of the Chambal where a normal human being never wished to visit even in the nightmare there lies a Man - an athlete – a sports person from soul- And a Dacoit now whose winning run for the great nation called India went unnoticed due to crippled ,undemocratic, corrupt political and administration system and forced him to taken his own route for justice- A path which make which more noticed and more popular amongst the country's newspaper, radio and Parliament than winning his gold medals Indian National Games seven times in a row.The Movie opens up with a journalist who wants to interview the most terrible dacoit of the region Paan Singh Tomar and as the interview moves the story went into flashback. Paan Singh Tomar (Irrfan Khan) works in Army but his dietary supplement requirements moved him to the sport division of the army because there is no limit on diet in sports. Thou luckily his race talent got noticed by his senior to whom he delivered the ice cream at his home in just four minutes Unmelt. Soon he become National Champion in ""Indian National Games"" and later in ""International Military Games"" in 1967.But gradually his personal life takes over his Professional life, and the incidents after him changed the course of his life which tuned him from an athlete to a dacoit The movie touches some serious issues of the Indian sports and Indian sports persons. In a scene where Pan Singh participated in Asian Games at Tokyo , the organizer gave him new spike shoes which become the cause of his defeat because the athlete never practiced with those shoes earlier and sponsors want to show that India can afford spike shoes shows the level of training in the country even applicable today .In a second scene where the coach requested Pan singh to withdrew his name from 5000 mts race else coach's kin would have been lost that race shows again that the super sportsman you know may not be the best because the best was never given the chance. In a third scene where a villager was given bribe in terms of recruiting the villager's son in the Indian army again shows that all in the Indian military may not have joined the army to serve the nation but to serve their selfish motives. Fourth and very important the scene where the Paan Singh Tomar went to police station to file a FIR against his relatives who has grabbed his land unlawfully and beaten up his son helpless and was insulted and rejected shows the system's efficiency to tackle an issue which turns a common man into a rebel – A Dacoit Paan Singh Tomar also helps to think deepens into the political arena and government arrangements for the promotion of SPORTS not cricket because cricket is so over-hyped and overpaid that sponsors in the previous past has marketed it as a religion and few players as Demi- GODs that the other sports in India per say are lying on the stretcher waiting for the medicines of hope and support from the sponsors and government.Paan Singh Tomar may not celebrate the spirit of win like 'Chak de India' or ""Jo jeeta wohi sikandar"" But it does celebrates the spirit the True Sportsmanship and it does it perfectly & flawlessly-Kuods"
tt1620933,"Boosted By An Excellent Performance by Irfan Khan and the rest of the cast, and a meaningful and good story, Pan Singh Tomar is one of the better bollywood movies which has great performances from the cast, a great story which is worth telling, and Irfan Khan just makes it better with his excellent portrayel of his character.The Story is about a Daku(Dacoit)(Irfan) who was actually a soldier who fought for his country and could give it all for his country who then became a runner and wins gold medal at the Indian national games, but is forced to become a Dacoit after being neglected and insulted by the Police,and his mission is to rebel and defy the police department.Irfan Khan is one of the few Hollywood worthy actors in bollywood, and probably the best at what he does, he yet again shows his excellent acting qualities in this movie by giving an excellent performance as Paan Singh Tomar, and he has shown the change of his character from a strict soldier to a notorious dacoit with utmost skill. The Rest of the cast also does a very good job in making this into a very well acted movie.The Director does a decent job in making this film into one of the sensible movies made in bollywood, and good job from him for giving Irfan a perfect role in the movie. The Story which is based on a true story about the same man, is great and shows how many extremely talented athletes in India are neglected by the government and how they can become notorious at times. Overall this movie is great due to mainly an excellent performance by Irfan Khan and a great story, to make this into one of the better movies of 2012 till now.My Rating: 7.8/10"
tt1620933,"Paan Singh Tomar: Irfan Khan is one the greatest actors that we have in India. N...o Doubt. He takes the script to superlative levels. The dialogues are amusing and situations really funny and not crass. His transformation from a national level athlete to a dacoit in the Chambal Valley makes for a rare story. How many such stories have we heard of. Having gone through what Paan goes through its really easy to understand and empathise with the character Paan especially since he picks up arms when all else fails. He approaches all the govt machinery disposable to him..the army , collector and the no good bribe taking , dishonest, lazy unscrupulous Indian police who instead of protecting the citizens instead loots and harasses them and don't we all know that. One wants to run in the opposite direction when one has to deal with police in India and that's the truth none can deny. Paan knows that the unlawful path will lead to his death but to live under such suppression was just not acceptable to him anymore. In my mind Had it been me, i would have taken that coaching job that being an Olympian offered along with cushy discounts at army canteen and a peaceful retirement life on army pension with family.But in my mind I also want to shoot these stupid police guys who tell me not to take the route to my own home at the Aarey Colony. Thank God then that i have movies to pent out my emotions through Pan Singh Tomar."
tt1620933,"A Biopic is not the most interesting genre of film. However, Bollywood has made two memorable biopics in the past few years. Paan Singh Tomar is based on the life of a national steeplechase champion who did not get the recognition that he deserved and eventually became a dacoit in order to have his name printed in newspapers.Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, which was based on the life of Milkha Singh, has borrowed some elements from this magnificent movie which has managed to restore my faith in this genre. Paan Singh Tomar is played by Irrfan Khan who gives a career-best performance which is quite impressive considering the number of notable movies he has made. He plays the character in a nuanced manner that incorporates the unique dialect from his native place in Madhya Pradesh. The dedication to his role is palpable as he transforms himself, both physically and mentally, to play someone who has a lot of anger inside him due to the apathy of the Army and the Indian Media for not giving him his due recognition.Paan Singh Tomar epitomizes the struggle of athletes in India to gain recognition despite endless hard work and complete apathy from the government. There are a lot of changes that must be implemented to ensure that these athletes get proper training and diet to give their best performance.This movie is one of the finest to have come out from Bollywood. The producers must be given credit to back such a film in which the protagonist was largely unknown to the masses. The film accurately depicts the lifestyle in villages and the authenticity is further escalated by the unique dialect that all the characters use. Watch Irrfan Khan give one of the most memorable performance by an Indian actor."
tt1620933,"Paan Singh Tomar is a good film, with some excellent moments and definitely worth a watch. Having said that, there are aspects of it that stop it from being considered in the exalted company of great cinema.For one, the editing is a choppy in bits, moving from one scene to another rather abruptly. The titular characters motivations after achieving his main objective as a 'Baaghi' was not sketched out with one having to wonder, why does he keep doing this, what is the end goal. He's shown in too much of a positive light, which is a stark contrast to his actions. Probably, those bits were left on the editing table to make the film compact, but given the other wonderful aspects of the movie, you do wish that it was included somehow to give the story a sense of completeness.Now coming to the good parts. Irrfan, excellent as always. The way he emotes through his eyes and body language is probably the best in the industry, if not one of the best in the world. You can feel Paan Singh's pain, anger, fleeting joys and viciousness radiating out of him, even in silence. Although, I did express qualms about the choppy editing and missing bits, the overall story is well paced and told, at no moment, lagging in pace. The side characters do a good enough job in sketchy parts, but the movie about Paan Singh Tomar, sticks completely around the central character throughout the duration, and with Irrfan playing it to such excellence, I doubt if anyone would complain.Overall, it is a good film, that could have been an excellent film but for a few minor blips. Given the usual fare of movies, this definitely rises above the crowd."
tt1620933,"I loved the film,as it was really meant to give tribute to the unsung heroes of Indian sports history.Moreover Irfan Khan could portray the role of Paan Singh with his acting talent,which brought an overall originality to the character.Along with that the cinematographer is appreciated for snapping the scenes with a real artistic view. On one hand the film is truly recommended for the action loving movie fans. On the other hand,the film continued the trend of narration of the past with the help of a co-star(in this case the newspaper reporter),like Irfan Khan's hit movies like Life Of Pie.Also i couldn't get the reason ,why the film was awarded national award in the category of best film.Overall I suggest it as above average."
tt1620933,Absolute Fantastic. Movie run around army athletic turned BAGI Paan Singh Tomar. Story is great and direction is much great. Very catching direction and story. There is no slot in movie when you get bored.Irfan Khan is superb. He has done really great. There is a real social issue also. This is truth of rural India which politician are ignoring. When Paan Singh won national medal no body cares but when he kidnap some leader then everybody talks about him. This is still true in India. Tigmanshu Dhulia has done his best and he must be credited with full marks. Irfan Khan and Mahi Gil support him well. in short it is worth to watch the movie.
